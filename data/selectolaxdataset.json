How can intelligence emerge from nonintelli- gence? To answer that, we'll show that you can build a mind from many little parts, each mindless by itself. I'll call \"Society of Mind\" this scheme in which each mind is made of many smaller processes. These we'll call agents. Each mental agent by itself can only do some simple thing that needs no mind or thought at all. Yet when we join these agents in societies-in certain very special ways-this leads to true intelligence. There's nothing very technical in this book. It, too, is a society-of many small ideas. Each byitself isonlycommonsense,yetwhenwe joinenough of themwecanexplainthestrangest mysteries of mind. One trouble is that these ideas have lots of cross-connections. My explanations rarely go in neat, straight lines from start to end. I wish I could have lined them up so that you could climb straight to the top, by mental stair-steps, one by one. lnstead they're tied in tangled webs. Perhaps the fault is actually mine, for failing to find a tidy base of neatly ordered principles. But I'm inclined to lay the blame upon the nature of the mind: much of its power seems to stem from just the messy ways its agents cross-connect. If so, that complication can't be helped; it's only what we must expect from evolution's countless tricks. What can we do when things are hard to describe? We start by sketching out the roughest shapes to serve as scaffolds for the rest; it doesn't matter very much if some of those forms turn out partially wrong. Next, draw details to give these skeletons more lifelike flesh. Last, in the final filling-in, discard whichever first ideas no longer fit. That's what we do in real life, with puzzles that seem very hard. [t's much the same for shattered pots as for the cogs of great machines. Until you've seen some of the rest, you can't make sense of any part.\nI.I THE AGENTS OF THE MIND Good theories of the mind must span at least three different scales of time: slow, for the billion years in which our brains have evolved; fast, for the fleeting weeks and months of infancy and childhood; and in between, the centuries of growth of our ideas through history. To explain the mind, we have to show how minds are built from mindless stuff, from parts that are much smaller and simpler than anything we'd consider smart. Unless we can explain the mind in terms of things that have no thoughts or feelings of their own, we'll only have gone around in a circle. But what could those simpler particles be-the \"agents\" that compose our minds? This is the subject of our book, and knowing this, let's see our task. There are many questions to answer. Function: How do agents work? Embodiment: What are they made oft Interaction: How do they communicate? Origins: Where do the first agents come from? Heredity: Are we all born with the same agents? Learning: How do we make new agents and change old ones? Character: What are the most important kinds of agents? Authority: What happens when agents disagree? Intention: How could such networks want or wish? Competence: How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do? Selfiress: What gives them unity or personolity? Meaning: How could they understand anything? Sensibility: How could they have feelings and emotions? Awareness: How could they be conscious or self-aware? How could a theory of the mind explain so many things, when every separate question seems too hard to answer by itself? These questions all seem difficult, indeed, when we sever each one's connections to the other ones. But once we see the mind as a society of agents, each answer will illuminate the rest. t 8 P N O L O G U E\nI.2 THE MIND AND THE BRAIN It was never supposad lthe poet Imlac said] fhaf cogitation is inherent in matter, or that every particle is a thinking being. Yet if any part of matter be devoid of thought, what part cdn we suppose to think? Matter can differ from matter only in form, bulk, density, motion and direction of motion: to which of these, howeyer varied or combined, can consciousness be annexed? To be round or squdre, to be solid or fluid, to be great or little, to be moved slowly or swiftly one wdy or another, are modes of material existence, all equally alien from the nature of cogitation. If matter be once without thought, it can only be made to think by some new modification, but all the modifications which it can admit are equally unconnected with cogitative powers. - S e t v r u e l J o H N s o N How could solid-seeming brains support such ghostly things as thoughts? This question troubled many thinkers of the past. The world of thoughts and the world of things appeared to be too far apart to interact in any way. So long as thoughts seemed so utterly different from everything else, there seemed to be no place to start. A few centuries ago it seemed equally impossible to explain Life, because living things ap- peared to be so different from anything else. Plants seemed to grow from nothing. Animals could move and learn. Both could reproduce themselves-while nothing else could do such things. But then that awesome gap began to close. Every living thing was found to be composed of smaller cells, and cells turned out to be composed of complex but comprehensible chemicals. Soon it was found that plants did not create any substance at all but simply extracted most of their material from gases in the air. Mysteriously pulsing hearts turned out to be no more than mechanical pumps, composed of networks of muscle cells. But it was not until the present century that fohn von Neumann showed theoretically how cell-machines could reproduce while, almost independently, fames Watson and Francis Crick discovered how each cell ac- tually makes copies of its own hereditary code. No longer does an educated person have to seek any special, vital force to animate each living thing. Similarly, a century ago, we had essentially no way to start to explain how thinking works. Then psychologists like Sigmund Freud and fean Piaget produced their theories about child development. Somewhat later, on the mechanical side, mathematicians like Kurt Godel and Alan Turing began to reveal the hitherto unknown range of what machines could be made to do. These two streams of thought began to merge only in the 1940s, when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts began to show how machines might be made to see, reason, and remember. Research in the modern science of Artificial Intelligence started only in the 1950s, stimulated by the invention of modern computers. This inspired a flood of new ideas about how machines could do what only minds had done previously. Most people still believe that no machine could ever be conscious, or feel ambition, jealousy, humor, or have any other mental life-experience. To be sure, we are still far from being able to create machines that do all the things people do. But this only means that we need better theories about how thinking works. This book will show how the tiny machines that we'll call \"agents of the mind\" could be the long sought \"particles\" that those theories need. P R O L O G U E l 9\nI.3 THE SOCIEIT OF MIND You know that everything you think and do is thought and done by you. But what's a \"yotr\"? What kinds of smaller entities cooperate inside your mind to do your work? To start to see how minds are like societies, try this: pick uf a cup of tea! Your GRASPING agents want to keep hold of the cup. Your BALANCING agents want to keep the tea from spilling out. Your THIRST agents want you to drink the tea. Your MOVING agents want to get the cup to your lips. Yet none of these consume your mind as you roam about the room talking to your friends. You scarcely think at all aboutBalance;Balance has no concern with Grasp; Grasp has no interest inThirst; andThirst is not involved with your social problems. Why not? Because they can depend on one another. If each does its own little job, the really big iob will get done by all of them together: drinking tea. How many processes are going on, to keep that teacup level in your grasp? There must be at least a hundred of them, just to shape your wrist and palm and hand. Another thousand muscle systems must work to manage all the moving bones and joints that make your body walk around. And to keep everything in balance, each of those processes has to communicate with some of the others. What if you stumble and start to fall? Then many other processes quickly try to get things straight. Some of them are concerned with how you lean and where you place your feet. Others are occupied with what to do about the tea: you wouldn't want to burn your own hand, but neither would you want to scald someone else. You need ways to make quick decisions. All this happens while you talk, and none of it appears to need much thought. But when you come to think of it, neither does your talk itself. What kinds of agents choose your words so that you can express the things you mean? How do those words get arranged into phrases and sentences, each connected to the next? What agencies inside your mind keep track of all the things you've said-and, also, whom you've said them to? How foolish it can make you feel when you repeat-unless you're sure your audience is new. We're always doing several things at once, like planning and walking and talking, and this all seems so natural that we take it for granted. But these processes actually involve more ma- chinery than anyone can understand all at once. So, in the next few sections of this book, we'll focus on just one ordinary activity-making things with children's building-blocfts. First we'll break this process into smaller parts, and then we'll see how each of them relates to all the other parts. In doing this, we'll try to imitate how Galileo and Newton learned so much by studying the simplest kinds of pendulums and weights, mirrors and prisms. Our study of how to build with blocks will be like focusing a microscope on the simplest objects we can find, to open up a great and unexpected universe. It is the same reason why so many biologists today devote more attention to tiny germs and viruses than to magnificent lions and tigers. For me and a whole generation of students, the world of work with children's blocks has been the prism and the pendulum for studying intelligence. In science, one cdn learn the most by studying what seems the least. 20 P N O L O G U E\nI.4 THE WORTD OF BTOCKS Imagine a child playing with blocks, and imagine that smallei minds. Call them mental agents. Right now, an Builder's specialty is making towers from blocks' this child's mind contains a agent called Budlder is in Choose a place to start the tower.

Our child likes to watch a tower grow as each new block is placed on top. -But building a tower is too complicated a job for any single, simple agent, soBuilder has to ask for help from several other agents: In fact, even to find another block and place it on the J9*-\". top is too lig f9r a iob for any ,ir,gf.lg.*.

Before we're done, we'll need more agents than would fit in any diagram' FIN / SEE /l\\ D GET PI,,T , / \\ / \\ GRASP IIOVE RETEASE /r\\ /l\\ /l\\ Why break things into such small parts? Because minds, like towers, are made that way- .*\".pi that they'rJ composed of processes instead of blocks. And if making stacks of blocks ,..-, insignificant-remember that you didn't always feel that way. When first you found some buil{ng toys in early childhood, you probably spent foyful weeks of learning what to do with them. ti suth toys now seem relatively dull, then you must ask yourself how you have changed. Before you turned to more ambitious things, it once seemed strange and wonderful to be-able to build a tower or a house of blocks. Yet, though all grown-up persons know how to do such things, no one understands how we leam to do them! And that is what will concern us here. To pile up blocks into heaps and rows: these are skills each of us learned so long ago that we can't remember learning them at all. Now they seem mere common sense-and that's what makes psychology hard. This forgetfulness, the amnesia of infancy, makes us assume that all o,r, *orrd\"rful abilities were always there inside our minds, and we never stop to ask ourselves how they began and grew. BUITDER P N O L O G U E\nI.5 COMMON SENSE You cannot think about thinking, without thinking about thinking about something. - S e v u o u R P e p n n r We found a way to make our tower builder out of parts. But Builder is really far from done. To build a simple stack of blocks, our child's agents must accomplish all these other things. See must recognize its blocks, whatever their color, size, and place-in spite of different backgrounds, shades, and lights, and even when they're partially obscured by other things. Then, once that's done, Move has to guide the arm and hand through complicated paths in space, yet never strike the tower's top or hit the child's face. And think how foolish it would seem, if Find were to see, and Grasp were to grdsp, a block supporting the tower top! When we look closely at these requirements, we find a bewildering world of complicated questions. For example, how could Flnd determine which blocks are still available for use? It would have to \"understand\" the scene in terms of what it is trying to do. This means that we'll need theories both about what it means to understand and about how a machine could have a goal. Consider all the practical judgments that an actual Builder would have to make. It would have to decide whether there are enough blocks to accomplish its goal and whether they are strong and wide enough to support the others that will be placed on them. What if the tower starts to sway? A real builder must guess the cause. It is because some joint inside the column isn't square enough? Is the foundation insecure, or is the tower too tall for its width? Perhaps it is only because the last block was placed too roughly. All children learn about such things, but we rarely ever think about them in our later years. By the time we are adults we regard all of this to be simple \"common sense.\" But that deceptive pair of words conceals almost countless different skills. Common sense is not a simple thing. Insteod, it is an immense society of hard- earned practical ideas-of multitudes of life-learned rules and exceptions, disposi- tions ond tendencies, balances and checks. If common sense is so diverse and intricate, what makes it seem so obvious and natural? This illusion of simplicity comes from losing touch with what happened during infancy, when we formed our first abilities. As each new group of skills matures, we build more layers on top of them. As time goes on? the layers below become increasingly remote until, when we try to speak of them in later life, we find ourselves with little more to say than \"I don't know.\" zz P R O L O G U E\nI.6 AGENTS AND AGENCIES We want to explain intelligence as a combination of simpler things. This means that we must be sure to check, at every step, that none of our agents is, itself, intelligent. Otherwise, our theory would end up resembling the nineteenth-century \"chessplaying machine\" that was ex- posed by Edgar Allan Poe to actually conceal a human dwarf inside. Accordingly, whenever we find that an agent has to do anything complicated, we'll replace it with a subsociety of agents that do simpler things. Because of this, the reader must be prepared to feel a certain sense of loss. When we break things down to their smallest parts, they'll each seem dry as dust at first, as though some essence has been lost. For example, we've seen how to construct a tower-building skill by making Builder from little parts like Find and Gef. Now, where does its \"knowing-how-to-build\" reside when, clearly, it is not in any part-and yet those parts are all that Builder is? The answer: It is not enough to explain only what each separate agent does. We must also understand how those parts are interrelated-that is, how groups of agents can accomplish things. Accordingly, each step in this book uses two different ways to think about agents. If you were to watch Builder work, from the outside, with no idea of how it works inside, you'd have the impression that it knows how to build towers. But if you could see Builder from the inside, you'd surely find no knowledge there. You would see nothing more than a few switches, arranged in various ways to turn each other on and off. Does Builder \"really know\" how to build towersi The answer depends on how you look at it. Let's use two different words, \"dgent\" and\"agencyj'to say why Builder seems to lead a double life. As agency, it seems to know its fob. As agent, it cannot know anything at all. Seen by itself, as an agent, BUILDER is just a slmple procass that tums other agents on and off. Seen from outside, as an agency, BUILDER does whatever all its subagents aaomplish, using one anothels help. When you drive a car, you regard the steering wheel as an agency that you can use to change the car's direction. You don't care how it works. But when something goes wrong with the steering, and you want to understand what's happening, it's better to regard the steering wheel as just one agent in a larger agency: it turns a shaft that turns a gear to pull a rod that shifts the axle of a wheel. Of course, one doesn't always want to take this microscopic view; if you kept all those details in mind while driving, you might crash because it took too long to figure out which way to turn the wheel. Knowing how is not the same as knowing why. In this book, we'll always be switching between agents and agencies because, depending on our purposes, we'll have to use different viewpoints and kinds of descriptions. P R O L O G U E 23\ncH '|rEn 2 TVHOLES AND PARTS It is the nature of the mind that makes individuals kin, and the differences in the shape, form, or mdnner of the material atoms out of whose intricate relationships that mind is built are altogether trivial. -Iseec Asrrr,rov\n2.I COMPONENTS AND CONNECTIONS We saw that Builder's skill could be reduced to the simpler skills of Get and Puf. Then we saw how these, in turn, could be made of even simpler ones. Get merely needs to Move the hand to Grasp the block that Find just found. Put only has to Move the hand so that it puts that block upon the tower top. So it might appear that all of Builder's functions have been \"reduced\" to things that simpler parts can do. But something important has been left ort. Builder is not merely a collection of parts like Find, Cet, Put, and all the rest. For Builder would not work at all unless those agents were linked to one another bv a suitable nehvork of interconnections.

Of course not; you must also know which agents work for which. Similarly, you couldn't predict what would happen in a human community from knowing only what each separate individual can do; you must also know how they are organized-that is, who talks to whom. And it's the same for understanding any large and complex thing. First, we must know how each separate part works. Second, we must know how each part interacts with those to which it is connected. And third, we have to understand how all these local interactions combine to accomplish what that system does-as seen from the outside. In the case of the human brain, it will take a long time to solve these three kinds of problems. First we will have to understand how brain cells work. This will be difficult because there are hundreds of different types of brain cells. Then we'll have to understand how the cells of each type interact with the other types of cells to which they connect. There could be thousands of these different kinds of interactions. Then, finally, comes the hardest part: we'll also have to understand how our billions of brain cells are organized into societies. To do this, we'll need to develop many new theories and organizational concepts. The more we can find out about how our brains evolved from those of simpler animals, the easier that task will be. BUILDER W H O T E S A N D P A R T S 25\n2,2 NOVEIISTS AI{D REDUCTIONISTS It's always best when mysteries can be explained in terms of things we know. But when we find this hard to do, we must decide whether to keep trying to make old theories work or to discard them and try new ones. I think this is partly a matter of personality. Let's call \"Reduc- tionists\" those people who prefer to build on old ideas, and \"Novelists\" the ones who like to champion new hypotheses. Reductionists are usually right-at least at science's cautious core, where novelties rarely survive for long. Outside that realm, though, novelists reign, since older ideas have had more time to show their flaws. It really is amazing how certain sciences depend upon so few kinds of explanations. The science of physics can now explain virtually everything we see, at least in principle, in terms of how a very few kinds of particles and force-fields interact. Over the past few centuries reduc- tionism has been remarkably successful. What makes it possible to describe so much of the world in terms of so few basic rules? No one knows. Many scientists look on chemistry and physics as ideal models of what psychology should be like. After all, the atoms in the brain are subject to the same all-inclusive physical laws that govern every other form of matter. Then can we also explain what our brains actually do entirely in terms of those same basic principles? The answer is no, simply because even if we understood how each of our billions of brain cells work separately, this would not tell us how the brain works as an agency. The \"laws of thought\" depend not only upon the properties of those brain cells, but also on how they are connected. And these connections are established not by the basic, \"general\" laws of physics, but by the particular arrangements of the millions of bits of information in our inherited genes. To be sure, \"general\" laws apply to everything. But, for that very reason, they can rarely explain anything in particular. Does this mean that psychology must reiect the laws of physics and find its own? Of course not. It is not a matter of different laws, but of additional kinds of theories and principles that operate at higher levels of organization. Our ideas of how Builder works as an agency need not, and must not, conflict with our knowledge of how Builder's lowerlevel agents work. Each higher level of description must add to our knowledge about lower levels, rather than replace it. We'll return to the idea of \"level\" at many places in this book. Will psychology ever resemble any of the sciences that have successfully reduced their sub- jects to only a very few principles? That depends on what you mean by \"few. \" In physics, we're used to explanations in terms of perhaps a dozen basic principles. For psychology, our expla- nations will have to combine hundreds of smaller theories. To physicists, that number may seem too large. To humanists, it may seem too small. 26 W H O L E S A N D P A R T S\n2.3 PARTS AND WHOTES We're often told that certain wholes are \"more than the sum of their parts.\" We hear this expressed with reverent words like \"holistic\" and \"gestalt,\" whose academic tones suggest that they refer to clear and definite ideas. But I suspect the actual function of such terms is to anesthetize a sense of ignorance. We say \"gestalt\" when things combine to act in ways we can't explain, \"holistic\" when we're caught off guard by unexpected happenings and realize we understand less than we thought we did. For example, consider the two sets of questions below, the first \"subjective\" and the second \"objective\": What makes a drawing more than iust its separdte lines? How is a personality more than a set of traits? In what way is a culture more than d mere collection of customs? What makes a tower more than separate blocksT Why is a chain more than its various links? How is a wall more than a set of many bricks? Why do the \"objective\" questions seem less mysterious? Because we have good ways to answer them-in terms of how things interact. To explain how walls and towers work, we just point out how every block is held in place by its neighbors and by gravity. To explain why chainlinks cannot come apart, we can demonstrate how each would get in its neighbors'way. These explanations seem almost self-evident to adults. However, they did not seem so simple when we were children, and it took each of us several years to learn how real-world objects interact-for example, to prevent any two objects from ever being in the same place. We regard such knowledge as \"obvious\" only because we cannot remember how hard it was to learn. Why does it seem so much harder to explain our reactions to drawings, personalities, and cultural traditions? Many people assume that those \"subjective\" kinds of questions are impossi- ble to answer because they involve our minds. But that doesn't mean they can't be answered. It only means that we must first know more about our minds. \"Subiective\" reactions are also based on how things interact. The difference is that here we are not concerned with obiects in the wortd outside, but with processes inside our brains. In other words, those questions about arts, traits, and styles of life are actually quite techni- cal. They ask us to explain what happens among the agents in our minds. But this is a subject about which we have never learned very much-and neither have our sciences. Such questions will be answered in time. But it will just prolong the wait if we keep using pseudo-explanation words like \"holistic\" and \"gestalt.\" True, sometimes giving names to things can help by leading us to focus on some mystery. It's harmful, though, when naming leads the mind to think that names alone bring meaning close. W I T O L E S A N D P A R T S 2 7\n2.4 HOTES AND PARTS It has been the persuasion of an immense maiority of human beings that sensibility and thought fas distinguished from matter] dre, in their own ndture, Iess susceptible of division and decay, and that, when the body is resolved into its elements, the principle which animated it will remain perpetual and unchanged. However, it is probable that what we call thought is not an actual being, but no more than the relation between certain parts of that infinitely varied mass, of which the rest of the uniyerse is composed, and which cedEes to exist ds soon as those parts change their position with respect to each other. -Pnncy BvssHs SHerr-ny What is Life? One dissects a body but finds no life inside. What is Mind? One dissects a brain but finds no mind therein. Are life and mind so much more than the \"sum of their parts\" that it is useless to search for them? To answer that, consider this parody of a conversation between a Holist and an ordinary Citizen. Holist: \"l'll prove no box can hold d mouse. A box is made by nailing six boards together. But it's obvious that no box ean hold o mouse unless it has some'moTtse- tightness' or'containment.'Novt, no single board contains any containment, since the mouse can iust walk away from it. And if there is no containment in one board, there can't be any in six boards. So the box can have no mousetightness at aII. Theoretically, then, the mouse can escape!\" Citizen: \"Amazing. Then what does keep d mouse in a box?\" Holist: \"Oh, simple. Even though it has no real mousetightness, a good box can 'simulate' it so well that the mouse is fooled and can't figure out how to escape.\" What, then, keeps the mouse confined? Of course, it is the way a box prevents motion in all directions, because each board bars escape in a certain direction. The left side keeps the mouse from going left, the right from going right, the top keeps it from leaping out, and so on. The secret of a box is simply in how the boards are arranged to prevent motion in all directions! That's what confoining means. So it's silly to expect any separate board by itself to contain any containmenf, even though each contributes to the containing. It is like the cards of a straight flush in poker: only the full hand has any value at all. The same applies to words like life and mind.It is foolish to use these words for describing the smallest components of living things because these words were invented to describe how larger assemblies interact. Like boxing-ln, words like living and thinking are useful for describ- ing phenomena that result from certain combinations of relationships. The reason box seems nonmysterious is that everyone understands how the boards of a well-made box interact to prevent motion in any direction. In fact, the word life has already lost most of its mystery-at least for modern biologists, because they understand so many of the important interactions among the chemicals in cells. But mind still holds its mystery-because we still know so little about how mental agents interact to accomplish all the things they do. 28 W H O L E S A N D P A R T S\n2.5 EASY THINGS ARE TIARD In the late 1960s Builder was embodied in the form of a computer program at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Both my collaborator, Seymour Papert, and I had long de- sired to combine a mechanical hand, a television eye, and a computer into a robot that could build with children's building-blocks. It took several years for us and our students to develop Mo,,te, See, Grasp, and hundreds of other little programs we needed to make a working Builder- agency. I like to think that this project gave us glimpses of what happens inside certain parts of children's minds when they learn to \"play\" with simple toys. The project left us wondering if even a thousand microskills would be enough to enable a child to fill a pail with sand. [t was this body of experience, more than anything we'd learned about psychology, that led us to many ideas about societies of mind. To do those first experiments, we had to build a mechanical Hand, equipped with sensors for pressure and touch at its fingertips. Then we had to interface a television camera with our computer and write programs with which that Eye could discern the edges of the building- blocks. It also had to recognize the Hand itself. When those programs didn't work so well, we added more programs that used the fingers'feeling-sense to verify that things were where they visually seemed to be. Yet other programs were needed to enable the computer to move the Hand from place to place while using the Eye to see that there was nothing in its way. We also had to write higher-level programs that the robot could use for planning what to do-and still more programs to make sure that those plans were actually carried out. To make this all work reliably, we needed programs to verify at every step (again by using Eye and Hand) that what had been planned inside the mind did actually take place outside-or else to correct the mistakes that occurred. In attempting to make our robot work, we found that many everyday problems were much more complicated than the sorts of problems, puzzles, and games adults consider hard. At every point, in that world of blocks, when we were forced to look more carefully than usual, we fogd an unexpected universe of complications. Consider just the seemingly simple problem of not reusing blocks already built into the tower. To a person, this seems simple common sense: \"Don't use dn obiect to satisfy d new goal if that obiect is already involved ii accomplish- ing a pior godl.\" No one knows exactly how human minds do this. Clearly we learn from experience to recognize the situations in which difficulties are likely to occur, and when we're older we learn to plan ahead to avoid such conflicts. But since we cannot be sure what will work, we must learn policies for dealing with uncertainty. Which strategies are best to try, and which will avoid the worst mistakes? Thousands and, perhaps, millions of little processes must be involved in how we anticipate, imagine, plan, predict, \"nd pr.u.nt-and yet ail this proceeds so automatically that we regard it as \"ordinary common sense.\" But if thinking is so compli- cated, what makes it seem so simple? At first it may seem incredible that our minds could use such intricate machinery and yet be unaware of it. In general, we're least dwdre of what our minds do best. It's mainly when our other systems start to fail that we engage the special agencies involved with what we call \"consciousness.\" Accordingly, we're more i*\"r. of smpte processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work fawlessly. This means that we cannot trust our offhand iudgments about which of the things we do are simple, and which require complicated machinery. Most times, each portion of the mind can only sense how quietly the other iortions do their iobs. W H O L E S A N D P A R T S Z Y\n2.6 ARE PEOPTE MACHINES? Many people feel offended when their minds are likened to computer programs or machines. We've seen how a simple tower-building skill can be composed of smaller parts. But could anything like a real mind be made of stuff so trivial? \"Ridiculous,\" most people say. \"f certainly don't feel like a mochine!\" But if you're not a machine, what makes you an authority on what it feels like to be a machine? A person might reply, \"I think, therefore I know how the mind works.\" But that would be suspiciously like saying, \"I driye my cdr, therefore I know how its engine 1torks.\" Knowing how to use something is not the same as knowing how it works. \"But eteryone knows that machines cdn behave only in lifeless, mechanical wdys.\" This objection seems more reasonable: indeed, a person ought to feel offended at being likened to any triyiol machine. But it seems to me that the word \"machine\" is getting to be out of date. For centuries, words like \"mechanical\" made us think of simple devices like pulleys, levers, locomotives, and typewriters. (The word \"computerlike\" inherited a similar sense of pettiness, of doing dull arithmetic by little steps.) But we ought to recognize that we're still in an early era of machines, with virtually no idea of what they may become. What if some visitor from Mars had come a billion years ago to judge the fate of earthly life from watching clumps of cells that hadn't even learned to crawl? In the same way, we cannot grasp the range of what machines may do in the future from seeing what's on view right now. Our first intuitions about computers came from experiences with machines of the 1940s, which contained only thousands of parts. But a human brain contains billions of cells, each one complicated by itself and connected to many thousands of others. Present-day computers represent an intermediate degree of complexity; they now have millions of parts, and people already are building billion-part computers for research on Artificial Intelligence. And yet, in spite of what is happening, we continue to use old words as though there had been no change at all. We need to adapt our attitudes to phenomena that work on scales never before con- ceived. The term \"machine\" no longer takes us far enough. But rhetoric won't settle anything. Let's put these arguments aside and try instead to under- stand what the vast, unknown mechanisms of the brain may do. Then we'll find more self- respect in knowing what wonderful machines we are. 30 W H O L E S A N D P A R T S\nCHAPTER 3 CONFI,JCT AND COMPROMISE\n3.1 coNFucT Most children not only like another agent called Wrecker, complicated noises and watch to build, they also like to knock things whose specialty is knocking-down. Our so many things move all at once. down. So let's imagine child loves to hear the Suppose Wrecker gets aroused, but there's nothing in sight to smash. Then Wrecfterwill have to get some help-by putting Builder to work, for example. But what if, at some later time, Wricker considers the tower to be high enough to smash, while Builder wants to make it taller still? Who could settle that dispute? The simplest policy would be to leave that decision to Wrecker, who was responsible for activating Buitder in the first place. But in a more realistic picture of a child's mind, such choices would depend on many other agencies. For example, let's assume that both Builder andWreckeir were originally activated by a higher-level agent , Play-with-Blocks. Then, a conflict might arise if Bull der andWrecker disagree about whether the tower is high enough. EAT+ PLAY -/l\\ ,/ l\\ ./t\\ SLEEP -} ,/l\\-. PLAY. PLAY. PLAY. WITH. WITH. WITH. DOLLS BLOCKS ANIMALS BUILDER WRECKER ,=o'n/olo\\n/ ).\",, What aroused Play-with-Blocks in the first place? Perhaps some even higher-level agent, Play, was active first. Then, inside Play, the agentPlay-with-Blocks achieved control, in spite of two competitors, Play-with-Dolls and Play-with-Animals. But even PIay itself, their mutual supe- rior'in chief, must have had to compete with other higherJevel agencies like Eaf and Sleep. For, after ali, a child's play is not an isolated thing but always happens in the context of other real-life concerns. Whalever we may choose to do, there are always other things we'd also like to do. In several sections of this book, I will assume that conflicts between agents tend to migrate upward to higher levels. For example, any prolonged conflict between Builder andWrecker will tend to weakin their mutual superior, Ptay-with-Blocks. In turn, this will reduce Play-with' Blocks'ability to suppress ifs rivals, Play-with-Dolls and Play-with-Animals. Next, if that con- flict isn't settied ,oo.r, it will weaken the agent Play at the next-higher level. Then Eaf ot Sleep might seize control. C O N F T I C T A N D C O M P R O M I S E\n3.2 NONCOMPROMISE To settle arguments, nations develop legal systems, corporations establish policies, and indi- viduals may argue, fight, or compromise-or turn for help to mediators that lie outside them- selves. What happens when there are conflicts inside minds? Whenever several agents have to compete for the same resources, they are likely to get into conflicts. If those agents were left to themselves, the conflicts might persist indefinitely, and this would leave those agents paralyzed, unable to accomplish any goal. What happens then? We'll assume that those agents' supervisors, too, are under competitive pressure and likely to grow weak themselves whenever their subordinates are slow in achieving their goals, no matter whether because of conflicts between them or because of individual incompetence. The Principle of Noncompromis e: The longer an internal conflict persists among an dgent's subordinates, the weaker becomes that agent's status dmong its own competitors. lf such internal problems dren't settled soon, other agents will take control and the agents formerly involved wiII be \"dismissed.\" So long as playing with blocks goes well, Play can maintain its strength and keep control. In the meantime, though, the child may also be growing hungry and sleepy, becauie other pro- cesses are arousing the agents Eaf and Sleep. So long as Eat and Sleep are not yet strongly activated, PIay can hold them both at bay. However, any conflict inside Play will weaken it and makeiteasier forEatorsleep totakeover. Of course, EatorSleepmustconquerintheend, since the longer they wait, the stronger they get. We see this in our own experience. We all know how easy it is to fight off small distractions when things are going well. But once some trouble starts inside our work, we become increas- ingly impatient and irritable. Eventually we find it so hard to concentrate that the least distur- bance can allow another, different, interest to take control. Now, when any of our agencies loses the power to control what other systems do, that doesn't mean it has to cease its own internal activity. An agency that has lost control can continue to work inside itself-and thus become prepared to seize a later opportunity. However, we're normally unaware of all those other activities proceeding deep inside our minds. Where does it stop, this process of yielding control to other agencies? Must every mind contain some topmost center of control? Not necessarily. We sometimes settle con{iicts by appealing to superiors, but other conflicts never end and never cease to trouble us. At first, our principle of noncompromise may seem too extreme. After all. eood human supervisors plan ahead to avoid conflicts in the first place, and-when they can't-they try to settle quarrels locallybefore appealing to superiors. But we should not try to find a close in^iogy between the low-level agents of a single mind and the members of a human community Thole tiny mental agents simply cannot know enough to be able to negotiate with one anotirer or to find effective ways to adiust to each other's interference. Only larger agencies could be re- sourceful enough to do such things. Inside an actual child, the \"genci.r responsible for Build- ing and Wrecking might indeed become versatile enough to negotiate by oifering support for one another's goals. \"Pledse, Wrecker, wait a moment more till Builder add.s iltst one more block: it's worth it for a louder crdsh!\" I t,F C O N F L I C T A N D C O M P R O M I S E J J\n3.3 HIERARCHIES bu.reauc'ra.c/ n. the administration of government through departments and subdivisions managed by sets of officials followine an inflexible routine. I-w nbrt ni. lJ nabri d ged D ic t ionary As an agent, Builder does no physical work but merely turns on Begin, Add, and End. Similarly, Add just orders Find, Put, and Get to do their iobs. Then these divide into agents like Move and Grasp. It seems that it will never stop-this breaking-down to smaller things. Eventually, it all must end with agents that do actual work, but there are many steps before we get to all the little muscle-motor agents that actually move the arms and hands and finger ioints. Thus Builder is like a highJevel executive, far removed from those subordinates who actually produce the final product. Does this mean that Builder's administrative work is unimportant? Not at all. Those lower- level agents need to be controlled. It's much the same in human affairs. When any enterprise becomes too complex and large for one person to do, we construct organizations in which certain agents are concerned, not with the final result, but only with what some other agents do. Designing any society, be it human or mechanical, involves decisions like these: Which agents choose which others to do what iobs? Who will decide which iobs are done at all? Who decides what efforts to exPend? How will conflicts be settledT How much of ordinary human thought has Builder's character? The Builder we described is not much like a human supervisor. It doesn't decide which agents to assign to which iobs, because that has already been arranged. It doesn't plan its future work but simply carries out fixed steps until End says the job is done. Nor has it any repertoire of ways to deal with unexpected accidents. Because our little mental agents are so limited, we should not try to extend very far the analogy between them and human supervisors and workers. Furthermore, as we'll shortly see' the relations between mental agents are not always strictly hierarchical. And in any case, such roles are always relative. ToBiilder, Add is a subordinate, but toFind, Add is a boss' As for yourself, it all depends on how you live. Which sorts of thoughts concern you most-the orders you are made to take or those you're being forced to give? 3A C O N F L I C T A N D C O M P R O M I S E\n3.4 HETERJA'RCHIES A hierarchical society is like a tree in which the agent at each branch is exclusively responsible for the agents on the twigs that branch from it. This pattern is found in every field, because dividing work into parts like that is usually the easiest way to start solving a problem. It is easy to construct and understand such organizations because each agent has only a single iob to do: it needs only to \"look up\" for instructions from its supervisor, then \"look down\" to get help from its subordinates. But hierarchies do not always work. Consider that when two agents need to use each other's skills, then neither one can be \"on top. \" Notice what happens, for example, when you ask your vision-system to decide whether the left-side scene below depicts three blocks-or only two. 6,,,u+!@ Whatyou see. ls lt this? Orthis? The agent See could answer that if it could Move the front block out of the line of view. But, in the course of doing that, Move might have to See if there were any obstacles that might interfere with the arm's trajectory. At such a moment, Move would be working for See, and See would be working for Move, both at the same time. This would be impossible inside a simple hierarchy. Most of the diagrams in the early parts of this book depict simple hierarchies. Later, we'll see more cross-connected rings and loops-when we are forced to consider the need for menory, which will become a constant subject of concern in this book. People often think of memory in terms of keeping records of the past, for recollecting things that happened in earlier times. But agencies also need other kinds of memory as well. See, for example, requires some sort of temporary ru-emory in order to keep track of what next to do, when it starts one job before its previous job is done. If each of See's agents could do only one thing at a time, it would soon run out of resources and be unable to solve complicated problems. But if we have enough memory, we can arrange our agents into circular loops and thus use the same agents over and over again to do parts of several different jobs at the same time.

What happens the agents Play controlled? the urge to Play competes with if another agent wrests control other demanding urges, such fromPlay, and what happens as to +-+ El ./l @Ef,Olt Suppose that our child is called away, no matter whether by someone else or by an internal urge like Sleep. What happens to the processes remaining active in the mind? One part of the child may still want to play, while another part wants to sleep. Perhaps the child will knock the tower down with a sudden, vengeful kick. What does it mean when children make such scenes? Is it that inner discipline breaks down to cause those savage acts? Not necessarily. Those \"childish\" acts might still make sense in other ways. Smashing takes so little time that Wrecker, freed from Play's constraint, need persist for only one more kick to gain the satisfaction of a final crash- Though childish yiolence might seem senseless by itself, it serves to communicate frustration at the loss of goal. Even if the parent scolds, that iust confirms how well the messdge was transmitted and received. Destructive acts can seme constructive goals by leaving fewer problems to be solved. That kick may leave d mess outside, yet tidy up the child's mind. When children smash their treasured toys, we shouldn't ask for the reason why-since no such act has a single cause. Besides, it isn't true, in a human mind, that when Sleep starts, then Play must quit and all its agents have to cease. A real child can go to bed-yet still build towers in its head. 36 C O N F L I C T A N D C O M P N O M I S E\n3.6 PAIN AI{D PI.EAST'RE SIMPIJFIED When you're in pain, it's hard to keep your interest in other things. You feel that nothing's more important than finding some way to stop the pain. That's why pain is so powerful: it makes it hard to think of anything else. Pain simplifies your point of view. When something gives you pleasure, then, too, it's hard to think of other things. You feel that nothing's more important than finding a way to make that pleasure last. That's why pleasure is so powerful. It also simplifies your point of view. Pain's power to distract us from our other goals is not an accident; that's how it helps us to survive. Our bodies are endowed with special nerves that detect impending iniuries, and the signals from these nerves for pain make us react in special ways. Somehow, they disrupt our concerns with long-term goals-thus forcing us to focus on immediate problems, perhips by transferring control to our lowestlevel agencies. Of course, this can do more hat* lhan good, especially when, in order to remove the source of pain, one has to make a complex plan. Unfortunately, pain interferes with making plans by undermining interest in anything that's not immediate. Too much suffering diminishes us by restricting the complexities that constitute our very selves. It must be the same for pleasure as well. We think of pleasure and pain as opposites, since pleasure makes us draw its object near while pain impels us to reject its object. We also think of them as similar, since both make rival goals seem small by turning us from other interests. They both distract. Why do we find such similarities between antagonistic things? Sometimes two seeming opposites are merely two extremes along a single scale, or one of them is nothing but the absence of the other-as in the case of sound and silence, light and darkness, interest and unconcern. But what of opposites that are genuinely different, like pain and pleasure, fear and courage, hate and love? ln order to appear opposed, two things must serve related goals-or otherwise engdge the selfsame agencies. Thus, affection and abhorrence both involve our attitudes toward relationships; and pleasure and pain both engage constraints that simplify our mental scenes. The same goes for courage and cowardice: each does best by knowing both. When on attack, you havelo press against whatever weakness you can find in your opponent's strategy. When on defense, ii's muc-h the same: you still must guess the other's plan. C O N F L I C T A N D C O M P R O M I S E 37\ncuj|'gfEn 4 THE SEIF We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. -Kunr VonNncur\n4.I THE SELF self n. 1. the identity, chdracter, or essentiol quolities of any percon or thing. 2. the identity, personality, individuality, etc' of a given person; one's own person as distinct from aII others' *W eb s ter' s U n abridge d D ic tionary We all believe that human minds contain those special entities we call selves. But no one agrees about what they are. To keep things straight, I shall write \"self\" when speaking in a general sense about an entire person and reserve \"Self\" for talking about that more mysterious iense of personal identity. Here are some of the things people say about the Self: Self is the part of mind that's really me, or rather, it's the part of me-that is, part of my mind-that actually does the thinking and wanting and deciding and en' ioying ond suffering. It's the paft thot's most important to me because it's that which stays the same through all experience-the identity which ties everything together. And whether you can treat it scientifically or not, I know it's there, because it's me. Perhaps it's the sort of thing that Science can't explain. This isn't much of a definition, but I don't think it is a good idea to try to find a better one. It often does more harm than good to force definitions on things we don't understand. Besides, only in logic and mathematics do definitions ever capture concepts perfectly. The things we deal with in practical life are usually too complicated to be represented by neat, compact expressions. Especially when it comes to understanding minds, we still know so little that we can't be sure our ideas about psychology are even aimed in the right directions. In any case, one must not mistake defining things for knowing what they are. You can know what a tiger is without defining it. You may define a tiger, yet know scarcely anything about it. Even if our old ideas about the mind are wrong, we can learn a lot by trying to understand why we believe them. Instead of asking, \"What are Selves?\" we can ask, instead , \"What dre our ideas about Selyes?\"-and then we can ask,\"What psychological functions do those ideas serve?\" When we do this, it shows us that we do not have one such idea, but many. Our ideas about our Selves include beliefs about what we are. These include beliefs both about what we are capable of doing and about what we may be disposed to do. We exploit these beliefs whenever we solve problems or make plans. I'll refer to them, rather vaguely, as a person's self-images. In addition to our self-images, our ideas about ourselves also include ideas about what we'd like to be and ideas about what we ought to be. These, which I'11 call a person's self-ideols, influence each person's growth from infancy, but we usually find them hard to express because they're inaccessible to consciousness. T H E S E t F\n4.2 ONE SEIF OR MANY? One common image of the Self suggests that every mind contains some sort of Voyeur- Puppeteer inside-to feel and want and choose for us the things we feel, want, and choose. But if we had thosa kinds of Selves, what would be the use of having Minds? And, on the other hand, if Minds could do such things themselves, why have Selves? Is this concept of a Self of any real use at all? It is indeed-provided that we think of it not as a centralized and all- powerful entity, but as a society of ideas that include both our images of what the mind is and our ideals about what it ought to be. Besides, we're often of two minds about ourselves. Sometimes we regard ourselves as single, self-coherent entities. Other times we feel decentralized or dispersed, as though we were made of many different parts with different tendencies. Contrast these views: SINGLE-SELF VIEW. \"I think,l want,I feel. lt's me, myself, who thinks my thoughts. It's not some ndmeless crowd or cloud of selfless parts.\" MULTIPLE-SELF VIEW. \"One part of me wants this, another part wants that. I must get better control of myself.\" We're never wholly satisfied with either view. We all sense feelings of disunity, conflicting motives, compulsions, internal tensions, and dissensions. We carry on negotiations in our head. We hear scary tales in which some person's mind becomes enslaved by compulsions and com- mands that seem to come from somewhere else. And the times we feel most reasonably unified can be just the times that others see us as the most confused. But if there is no single, central, ruling Self inside the mind, what makes us feel so sure that one exists? What gives that myth its force and strength? A paradox: perhaps it's because there are no persons in our heads to make us do the things ws wznf-nor even ones to make us want to want-that we construct the mvth that we're inside ourselves. 40 T H E S E L F\n4.3 THE SOUL And we thankThee that darkness reminds us of lieht' - T . S . E t - t o r A common concept of the soul is that the essence of a self lies in some spark of invisible light, a thing that cowers out of body, out of mind, and out of sight. But what might s.uch a symbgl mean? It carries a sense of anti*elf-respecl that there is no significance in anyone's accomplish- ments. people ask if machines can have souls. And I ask back whether souls can learn. It does not ,..- \" fair exchan ge_1f souls can live for endless time and yet not use that time to learn-to irade all change fJr changelessness. And that's exactly what we get with inborn souls that cannot gro*, \"'d\"rtiny the iame as death, an ending in a permanence incapable of any change and, hence, devoid of intellect. Why try to frame the value of a Self in such a singularly frozen form? The art of a great painting ii not in any one idea, nor in a multitude of separate tricks for placing all those pigment spots, U\",tt i.r the great network of relationships among its parts. Similarly, the agents, raw, that make our minds ire by themselves as valueless as aimless, scattered daubs of paint. What counts is what we make of them. We all know how an ugly husk can hide an unexpected gift, like a treasure buried in the dust or a graceless oyster bearing a pearl. But minds are just the opposite. We start as little embryos, which then build great and wondrous selves-whose merit lies entirely within their own co- herency. The value of a human self lies not in some small, precious core, but in its vast, constructed crust. What are those old and fierce beliefs in spirits, souls, and essences? They're all insinuations that we're helpless to improve ourselyes. To look for our virtues in such thoughts seems just as wrongly aimed a search as seeking art in canvas cloths by scraping off the painter's works. T H E S E I T 4 I\n4.4 THE CONSERVATNTE SEI.F How do we control our minds? Ideally, we first choose what we want to do, then make ourselves do it. But that's harder than it sounds: we spend our lives in search of schemes for self-control. We celebrate when we succeed, and when we fail, we're angry with ourselves for not behaving as we wanted to-and then we try to scold or shame or bribe ourselves to change our ways. But wait! How could a self be angry with itself? Who would be mad at whom? Consider an example from everyday life. I was trying to concentrate on a certain problem but was getting bored and sleepy. Then I imagined that one of my competitors, Professor Challenger, was about to solve the same problem. An angry wish to frustrate Challenger then kept me work- ing on the problem for a while. The strange thing was, this problem was not of the sort that eyer interested Challenger. What makes us use such roundabout techniques to influence ourselves? Why be so indirect, inventing misrepresentations, fantasies, and outright lies? Why can't we simply tell ourselves to do the things we want to do? To understand how something works, one has to know its purposes. Once, no one under- stood the heart. But as soon as it was seen that hearts move blood, a lot of other things made sense: those things that looked like pipes and valves were really pipes and valves indeed-and anxious, pounding, pulsing hearts were recognized as simple pumps. New speculations could then be formed: was this to give our tissues drink or food? Was it to keep our bodies warm or cool? For sending messages from place to place? In fact, all those hypotheses were correct, and when that surge of functional ideas led to the guess that blood can carry air as well, more puzzle parts fell into place. To understand what we call the Sell we first must see what Selves are for. One function of the SeIf is to keep us from changing too rapidly. Each person must make some long-range plans in order to balance single-purposeness against attempts to do everything at once. But it is not enough simply to instruct an agency to start to carry out our plans. We also have to find some ways to constrain the changes we might later make-to prevent ourselves from turning those plan-agents off again! If we changed our minds too recklessly, we could never know what we might want next. We'd never get much done because we could never depend on ourselves. Those ordinary views are wrong that hold that Selves are magic, self-indulgent luxuries that enable our minds to break the bonds of natural cause and law. Instead, those Selves are practical necessities. The myths that say that Selves embody special kinds of liberty are merely masquerades. Part of their function is to hide from us the nature of our self-ideals-the chains we forge to keep ourselves from wrecking all the plans we make. 42 T H E S E t F\n4.5 EXPTOITATION Let,s look more closely at that episode of Professor Challenger. Apparently,-what happened was that my agency fo work e*plfited Anget to stop sleep. But why should work use such a devious trick? - To see why we have to be so indirect, consider some alternatives. If Work could simply turn oflibup, we'd quick1y wear our bodies out. If Work could simply switch Anger on, we'd be fighting'all the time. Directness is too dangerous' We'd die' Extiiction would be swift indeed for species that could simply switch off trunger or pain. Instead, there must be checks and balances. We'd never get through one full day if any agency could seize and hold control over all the rest. This must be why our agencies, in order to exploit each other's skills, have to discover such roundabout pathways. All direct connections must have been removed in the course of our evolution. This must be one reason why we use fantasies: to provide the missing paths. You may not be able to make yourself angry simply by deciding to be angry, but you can still imagine obiects or situations thitmake yo,t \"tgry. In the scenario about Professor Challenger, my agencyWo,\\ .*ptoit.a a particular memory to arouse my Anger's tendency to counter Sleep. This is typical of the tricks we use for self-control' Most of our self-control methods proceed unconsciously, but we sometimes resort to con- scious schemes in which we offer rewards to ourselves'.\"lf I can get this proiect done,I'll have more time for other things.\" However, it is not such a simple thing to be able to bribe yourself. To do it successfully, you have to discover which mental incentives will actually work on yourself. This means that you-or rather, your agencies-have to learn something about one another's dispositions. In this respect the schemes we use to influence ourselves don't seem to differ much lrom those we use to exploit other people-and, similarly, they often fail. When we try to induce ourselves to work by offering ourselves rewards, we don't always keep our bargains; we then proceed to raise the price or even to deceive ourselves, much as one person may try to conceal an unattractive aspect of a bargain from anothel pelson. Au-rn self-control is no simple skill, but an ever-growing world of expertise that reaches into everything we do. Why is it that, in the end, so few of our self-incentive tricks work well? Because, as *. h\"ue seen, directness is too dangerous. If self-control were easy to obtain, we'd end up accomplishing nothing at all. T H E S E t F 43\n4,6 SELF.CONTROT Those who really seek the path to Enlightenment dictate terms to their mind. Then they proceed with strong determination. -B unoue The episode of Professor Challenger showed just one way we can control ourselves: by exploiting an emotional aversion in order to accomplish an intellectual purpose. Consider ail the other kinds of tricks we use to try to force ourselves to work when we're tired or distracted. WILLPOWER: TeIl yourself, \"Don't give in to thdt,\" or, \"Keep on trying.\" Such self-injunctions can work at first-but finally they always fail, as though some engine in the mind runs out of fuel. Another style of self-control involves more physical activity: ACTMTY: Moye around. Exercise.lnhale. Shout. Certain physical acts are peculiarly effective, especially the facial expressions involved in social communication: they affect the sender as much as the recipient. EXPRESSION; Sef iaw. Stiffen upper lip. Funow brow. Another kind of stimulating act is moving to a stimulating place. And we often perform actions that directly change the brain's chemical environment. CHEMISTRY: Take coffee, amphetamines, or other brain-affecting drugs. Then there are actions in the mind with which we set up thoughts and fantasies that move our own emotions, arousing hopes and fears through self-directed offers, bribes, and even threats. EMOTION: \"If I win, there's much to gain, but more to lose if I fail!\" Perhaps most powerful of all are those actions that promise gain or loss of the regard of certain special persons. ATTACHMENT; Imagine admiration if you succeed-or disapproval if you fail- especially from those to whom you dre attached. So many schemes for self-control! How do we choose which ones to use? There isn't any easy way. Self-discipline takes years to learn; it grows inside us stage by stage. 44 T H E S E t F\n4.7 IONG-RANGE PI,ANS In the search for truth there are certain questions that are not important. Of what material is the universe constructed? Is the uniyerse eternal? Are there limits or not to the universe? What is the ideal form of organization for human society? If a man were to postpone hX ieaih and proctice for Entightenment until such que,stions were solyed, he would die before he found the path. -Buooue We often become involved in projects that we can't complete. It is easy to solve small problems because we can treat thim as though they were detached from all our other goals' But it is different for proiects that span larger portions of our lives, like learning a trade, raising , \"iriia, or writing \" boo[. We cannot simply \"decide\" or \"choose\" to accomplish an enterprise n\"t *\"f..r alar{edemand for time, because it will inevitably conflict with other interests and ambitions. Then we'll be forced to ask questions like these: What must I give uP for this? What will I learn from it? WiU it bring Power and influence? Will I remain interested in it? Will other PeoPle heIP me with it? Will they still like me? Perhaps the most difficult question of all is, \"How witl adopting this goal chonge me?\" ltst wantingio own a large, expeniive house, for instance, can lead to elaborate thoughts like these: \"That medns I'd haye to sove for years and not get other things I'd like. I doubt that I could bear it. True, I could reform myself, and try to be more thrifty and deliberate. But that's iust not the sort of person I dm.\" Until such doubts are set aside, all the plans we make will be subiect to the danger that we may \"change our mind.\" So how can any long-range plan succeedZ The easiest path to \"self- control\" is doing only what one is already disposed to do' Many of the schemes we use for self-control are the same as those we learn to use for infuencing other people. We make ourselves behave by exploiting our own fears and desires, offering ourselves iewirds, or threatening the loss of what we love. But when short-range tricks won't k..p .m to our projects for long enough, we may need some way to make changes that won't let us change ourselves back again. I suspect that, in order to commit ourselves to our largest, most ambitious plans, we learn to exploit agencies that operate on larger spans oftime. Wni\"n are our slowest-changing agencies of all? Later we'll see that these must include the silent, hidden agencies that shape what we call character. These are the systems that are concerned not merely with the things we wdnt, but with what we want ourselves to be-that is, the ideals we set for ourselves. T H E S E T F 45\n4.8 IDEATS We usually reserve the word \"ideals\" to refer to how we think we ought to conduct our ethical affairs. But I'll use the term in a broader sense, to include the standards we maintain-con- sciously or otherwise-for how we ought to think about ordinary matters. We're always involved with goals of varying spans and scales. What happens when a transient inclination clashes with a long-term self-ideal? What happens, for that mitter, when our ideals disagree among themselves, as when there is an inconsistency between the things we want to do and those we feel we ought to do? These disparities give rise to feelings of discomfort, guilt, and shame. To lessen such disturbances, we must either change the things we do-or change the ways we feel. Which should we try to modify-our immediate wants or our ideals? SuJh conflicts must be settled by the multilayered agencies that are formed in the early years of the growth of our personalities. In childhood, our agencies acquire various types of goals. Then we grow in overlapping waves, in which our older agencies affect the making of the new. This way, the older agencies can influence how our later ones will behave. Outside the individual, similar processes go on in every human community; we find children \"taking after\" persons other than themselves by absorbing values from their parents, families, and peers, even from the heroes and villains of mythology. Without enduring self-ideals, our lives would lack coherence. As individuals, we'd never be able to trust ourselves to carry out our personal plans. In a social group, no one person would be able to trust the others. A working society must evolve mechanisms that stabilize ideals- and many of the social principles that each of us regards as personal are really \"long-term memories\" in which our cultures store what they have learned across the centuries. 46 T H E S E t F\ntr, crurrEn *J INDTVIDUALITY PUNCH AND II]DY, TO THEIR AUDIENCE Our puPPet strings are hatd to see, So we perceite ourselYes as free, Convinced that no mere obiects could Behave in terms of bad and good.

We seem to form a nested set, with each the next one's marionette, who, if you asked him, would insist that he's the last ventriloquist. - T s n ' o o o n n M n l N u c H U K\n5.I CIRCT'I.AR CAUSALIIT Whenever we can, we like to explain things in terms of simple cause and effect. We explained the case of Professor Challenger by assuming that my wish to Worft came first, then Worft exploited Anger's aptitude for fighting Sleep. But in real life the causal relations between feelings and thoughts are rarely so simple. My desire to work and my annoyance with Challerrg., *.i. probably so intermingled, all along, that it is inappropriate to ask which came first, Angu, o, Work. Most likely, both agencies exploited one another simultaneously, thus combining-both into a single fiendish synthesis that accomplished two goals at once; Work thus got to do iti work -and, thereby, injured Challengerl (ln an academic rivalry, a technical accomplishment can hurt more than a fist.) Two goals can support each other. A causes B \"lohn wanted to go home because he felt tired of work.\" B causes A \"lohn felt tired of work because he wanted to go home.\" There need be no \"first cause\" since fohn could start out with both distaste for work and inclination to go home. Then a loop of circular causality ensues, in which each goal gains support from the other until their combined urge becomes irresistible. We're always enmeshed in causal loops. Suppose you had borrowed past your means and later had to borrow more in order to pay the interest on your loan. If you were asked what the difficulty was, it would not be enough to say simply, \"Becdttse I haye to pay the interest,\" or to say only, \"Becdnse I have to pay the pincipal.\" Neither alone is the actual cause, and you'd have to explain that you're caught in a loop. We often speak of \"straightening things out\" when we're involved in situations that seem too complicated. It seems to me that this metaphor reflects how hard it is to find one's way through a maze that has complicated loops in it. In such a situation, we always try to find a \"path\" through it by seeking \"causal\" explanations that go in only one direction. There's a good reason for doing this. There are countless different types of networks that contain loops. But all networks that contain no loops are basically the same: each has the form of a simple chain. Because of this, we can apply the very same types of reasoning to everything we can represent in terms of chains of causes and effects. Whenever we accomplish that, we can proceed from start to end without any need for a novel thought; that's what we mean by \"straightening out.\" But frequently, to construct such a path, we have to ignore important interactions and depen- dencies that run in other directions. 48 I N D I V I D U A L I T Y\n5.2 UNANSWERASTE QI'ESTIONS And while it shalt please thee to continue me in this world, whete there its much to be done and little to be known, teach me, by thy Holy Spirit, to withdraw my mind from unprofitable 9nd - dangerous'enquiries, from difficulties vainly curious, and doubts imPossible to be solved. - S a u u s , t - f o H N s o N When we reflect on anything for long enough, we're likely to end up with what we sometimes call ,,basic\" questions-ones we can see to *ry at all to answer. For we have no perfect way to answer even this question: How can one tell *hn, o question has been properly answered? what caused the universe, and why? what is the purpose of lifeT How can you tell which beliefs are true? How can you tell what is good? These questions seem different on the surface, but all of them share one quality that makes them imptssible to answer: all of them are circularl You can never find a final cause, since you must always ask one question more: \"What coused that couse?\" You can never find any ultimate goal, since you're always obliged to ask, \"Then what purpose does that serve?\" Whenever you frnd out why something is goo?-or is true-you still have to ask what makes thaf reason good and true. No matter *h\"i you discover, at every step, these kinds of questions will always remain, because you have to challenge every answer with, \"Why should I accept that answer?\" Such circularitiei can only waste our time by forcing us to repeat, over and over and over again, \"What good is Good?\" and, \"What god mode God?\" -When children keep on asking, \"Why?\" we adults learn to deal with this by simply saying, \"lust because!\" This may seem obstinate, but it's also a form of self-control. What stops adults fiom dwelling on such questions endlessly? The answer is that every culture finds special ways to deal with ihese questions. One way is to brand them with shame and taboo; another way is to cloak them in awe or mystery; both methods make those questions undiscussable. Consensus is the simplest way-as with those social styles and trends wherein we each accept as true whatever \"tt ttt. others do. I think I once heard W. H. Auden say, \"We are all here on earth to help others. What I can't figure out is what the others are here for-\" All human cultures evolve institutions of law, religion, and philosophy, and these institutions both adopt specific answers to circular questions and establish authority-schemes to indoctri- nate people with those beliefs. One might complain that such establishments substitute dogma for reason and truth. But in exchange, they spare whole populations from wasting time in fruitless reason loops. Minds can lead more productive lives when working on problems that can be solved. But when thinking keeps returning to its source, it doesn't always mean something's wrong. For circular thinking can lead to growth when it results, at each return, in deeper and more powerful ideas. Then, because we can communicate, such systems of ideas may even find the means to cross the boundaries of selfish selves-and thus take root in other minds. This way' a language, science, or philosophy can transcend the limitation of each single mind's mortality. Now, we cannot know that any individual is destined for some paradise. Yet certain religions are oddly right; they manage to achieve their goal of offering an afterlife-if only to their own stranqe souls. I N D I V I D U A L I T Y 49\n5.3 THE REMOTE.CONTROT SEI.F When people have no answers to important questions, they often give some anyway. What controls the brain? The Mind. What controls the mind? The SeIf. What controls the SeIft ltself. To help us think about how our minds are connected to the outer world, our culture teaches schemes like this: This diagram depicts our sensory machinery as sending information to the brain, wherein it is proiected on some inner mental movie screen. Then, inside that ghostly theater, a lurking Self observes the scene and then considers what to do. Finally, that Self may act-somehow reversing all those steps-to influence the real world by sending various signals back through yet another family of remote-control accessories. This concept simply doesn't work. It cannot help for you to think that inside yourself lies someone else who does your work. This notion of \"homunsulu5\"-6 little person inside each self-leads only to a paradox since, then, that inner SeIf requires yet another movie screen inside itself, on which to proiect what it has seen! And then, to watch that play-within-a-play, we'd need yet another Self-inside-a-Self-to do the thinking for the last. And then this would all repeat again, as each new Self requires yet another one to do its job! The idea of a single, central Self doesn't explain anything. This is because a thing with no parts profides nothing that we cdn use as pieces of explanation! Then why do we so often embrace the strange idea that what we do is done by Someone Else -that is, our Self? Because so much of what our minds do is hidden from the parts of us that are involved with verbal consciousness. 50 I N D I V I D U A L I T Y\n5.4 PERSONAT IDENTIIT Whote'er the possion-knowledge, fame, or pelf, Not one will change his neighbor with himself' -ALexeNonn PoPs Why do we accept that paradoxical image of a central Self inside the selff Because it serves us well in many rph;;;r ;f practical life.

Because of that, we must base our plans and decisions on having a single body' Two -people cannot fit ,t nru ti.ere is ioom for only one-nor cdn d pe6on walk through walls or stay aloft without suPPort. personal Privacy: WhenMary tells lack something, she must remember to\"whom\" it was told, and she must not assume that ewry other person knows it, too. AIso, without thz concept of an individual, we could have no sense of responsibility ' Mental Activity: We often find it hard to think two different thoughts 4t once, particularly whin they're similar, because we get\"confused\" when the same Lgen' cies are asked to do different iobs at the same time' Why do our mental processes so often seem to us to flow in \"streams of consciousness\"? perhaps because, in order to keep control, we have to simplify how we represent what's happen- ,rrg, th.n, when that complicated mental scene is \"straightened out,\" it seems as though a single pipeline of ideas were flowing through the mind. ftt.r. \"r\" all compelling reasoni why it helps to see ourselves as singletons. Still, each of us must also learn not only that different people have their own identities, but that the same person can entertain different beliefs, pia.rs, and dispositiorrs at the same time. For finding good ideas about psychology, the single-agent imagg has become a grave impediment. To lo-preheld the human mind is surely one of the hardest tasks any mind can face' The legend of the single Self can only divert us from the target of that inquiry.

But the pa.uses between the notes-ah, that is where the art resides! - A n r u n S c H N a s e L Why do we like so many things that seem to us to have no earthly use? We often speak of this with mixtures of defensiveness and pride. \" Art for Art's sdke.\" \"l find it aesthetically pleasing.\" \"l iust like it.\" \"There's no accounting for it.\" Why do we take refuge in such vague, defiant declarations? \"There's no accounting for it\" sounds like a guilty child who's been told to keep accounts. And \"[ just like it\" sounds like a person who is hiding reasons too unworthy to admit. However, we often do have sound practi- cal reasons for making choices that have no reasons by themselves but have effects on larger scales. Recognizability: The legs of a chair work equally well if made square or round. Then why do we tend to choose our furniture according to systematic styles or fashionsT Because familiar styles make it easier for us to recognize and classify the things we see. Uniformity: lf every obiect in a room were interesting in itself , our fumiture might occupy our minds too much. By adopting uniform styles, we protect ourselves from distractions. Predictability: It mdkes no difference whether a single car drives on the left or on the right. But it makes aII the difference when there are mdny cars! Societies need rules that make no sense for individuals. It can save a lot of mental work if one makes each arbitrary choice the way one did before. The more difficult the decision, the more this policy can save. The following observation by my associate, Edward Fredkin, seems important enough to deserve a name: Fredkin's Paradox: The more equally attractiye two alternatites seem, the harder it can be to choose between them-no matter that, to the same degree, the choice can only matter less. No wonder we often can't account for \"12s1s\"-if it depends on hidden rules that we use when ordinary reasons cancel out! I do not mean to say that fashion, style, and art are all the same-only that they often share this strategy of using forms that lie beneath the surface of our thoughts. When should we quit reasoning and take recourse in rules of style? Only when we're fairly sure that further thought will just waste time. Perhaps that's why we often feel such a sense of being free from practicality when we make \"aesthetic\" choices. Such decisions might seem more constrained if we were aware of how they're made. And what about those fleeting hints of guilt we sometimes feel for \"just liking\" art? Perhaps they're how our minds remind themselves not to abandon thought too recklessly. cz I N D I V I D U A T I T Y\n5.6 TRAITS Isn't it remarkable that words can portray human individua-ls? You might suppose this should be impossibl., \"orrrid.rirrg ho* -y.tt th\"tl it to say. Then what permits a writer to depict such seemingly real personahtles? It is because we all \"ir.. on so many things that are left unsaid' For example, we \"rr.t*. ttrrt all the characters ,i. pott.tt\"d of what we call \"commonsense knowledge,\" and we also agree on many generalities about what we call \"human nature'\" Hostilityeyokesdefensiveness,Frustrationarousesaggression. We also recognize that individuals have particular qualities and traits of character' lane is tidy. Mary's timid- Grace-is smart' That,snotthesortofthingCharlesdoes.It,snothisstyle. Why should traits like these exist? Humanists are prone to boast about how hard it is to grasp the measure of a mind. But let's ask instead , \"Whot makes personolities so easy to portray?\" Wt v, io, example, should any person tend toward a general quality of being neat, rather than ,i.npiy being tidy about ,onl. ihings and messy about others? Why should our personalities show such cohererrcies? How coulJit be that a system assembled from a million agencies can U\" i.r.tlb.d by short and simple strings of words? Here are some possible reasons' Selectivity : First we should face the fact that our images of othe.r minds are often falsely cliar. We tend to think of another person's\"personality\" in terms of that which we cctn describe-and tenil to set aside the rest as though it simply weren't there. Style: To escape the effort of making decisions we co-nsider unimportant, we tend to develop poiicies tha.t become so iystematic that they can be discerned from the outside and characterized as personal traits' predictability: Because it is hard to maintain friendship without trust, we try to conform to the expectotions of our friends. They to the extent thot we frame our images of our associates in terms of traits, we find ourselves teaching ourselves to behave in accord with those same descriptions' Self-Reliance:Thus, over time, imagined traits can make themseltes actual! For eyen to carry out our own plans, we must be able to predict what we ourselves are likely to do-and that wiU become easier the more we simplify ourselves. It's nice to be able to trust our friends, but we need to be able to trust ourselves. How can that be possible when we can't be sure what's in our own heads? One way to accomplish this is by thinking of ourselves in terms of traits-and then proceeding to train -ourselves to behave aicording Io those self-images. Still, a personality is merely the surface of a person. What we call traitJ are only the regilarities we manage to perceive. We never really know ourselves because there are so manli other processes and policies that never show themselves directly in our behavior but work behind the scenes' I N D I V I D U A L I T Y\n]DONOT IR,IBAD TH]IS 5.7 PERMANENT IDENTITT There are cduses for all human suffering, and there is a woy by which they may be ended, because everything in the world is the result of a vast concunence of causes and conditions, and etterything disoppeors as these causes and conditions change and pass away. - B u o o H e Whlt do we slSnifv b-y words like \"me,\" \"myself,\" and \"I\"? What does a story mean that starts with \"In my childhood\"? What is that strange possession \"yo,r,\" which stays tire same through- out your life? Are you thesame person you were before you learned to read? You scarcely can imagine, now, how words looked then. fust try to look at these words without readine them: So far as consciousness is concerned, we find it almost impossible to separate the appearances of things from what they've come to mean to us. But if we cannot recollect how thingJappeared to us before we learned to link new meanings to those things, what makes us think we can recollect how we ourselves appeared to us in previous times? What would you say if someone asked questions like these: \"Are you the same person now that you once were, before you Iearned to talk?\" \"Of course I am. Why, who else could I be?\" \"Do you mean that you haven't changed at all?\" \"Of course not. I only mean l'm the same person-the same in some ways, different in others-but still the same me.\" \"But how can you be the same as the person you werc before you had even Iearned to remember things? Can you even imagine what that was like?\" \"Perhaps I can't-yet still there must have been some continuity. Eten if I can't remember it, I surely was that person, too.\" We all experience that sense of changelessness in spite of change, not only for the past but also for the future, too! Consider how you are generous to future self at present self's expense. Today, you put some money in the bank in order that sometime later you can take it out. Whenever did that future self do anything so good for you? Is \"you\" the body of those memories whose meanings change only slowly? Is it the never-ending side effects of all your previous experience? Or is it just whichever of your agents change the least as time and life proceed? 54 I N D I V I D U A T I T Y\ncrrAPrEn 5 INSIGHT AND INTROSPECTION MIND.

You drive a car, not knowing how its engine works. You ride as passenger in someone else's car, not knowing how that driver works. Most strange of all, you drive your body and your mind, not knowing how your own self works. Isn't it amazing that we can think, not knowing what it means to think? Isn't it remarkable that we can get ideas, yet not explain what ideas are? In every normal person's mind there seem to be some processes that we call consciousness. We usually regard them as enabling us to know what's happening inside our minds. But this reputation of self-awareness is not so well deserved, because our conscious thouehts reveal to us so little of what gives rise to them. Consider how a driver guides the immense momentum of a motorcar, not knowing how its engine works or how its steering wheel directs it to the left or right. Yet when one comes to think of it, we drive our bodies in much the same way. So far as conscious thought is con- cerned, you turn yourself to walk in a certain direction in much the way you steer a car; you are aware only of some general intention, and all the rest takes care of itself. To change your direction of motion is actually quite complicated. If you simply took a larger or smaller step on one side, the way you would turn a rowboat, you would fall toward the outside of the turn. Instead, you start to turn by making yourself fall toward the inside-and then use centrifugal force to right yourself on the next step. This incredible process involves a huge society of muscles, bones, and joints, all controlled by hundreds of interacting programs that even spe- cialists don't yet understand. Yet all you think is,Turn that way, and your wish is automatically fulfilled. We give the name \"signals\" to acts whose consequences are not inherent in their own character but have merely been assigned to them. When you accelerate your car by pressing on the gas pedal, this is not what does the work; it is merely a signal to make the engine push the car. Similarly, rotating the steering wheel is merely a signal that makes the steering mech- anism turn the car. The car's designer could easily have assigned the pedal to steer the car or made the steering wheel control its speed. But practical designers try to exploit the use of signals that already have acquired some significance. Our conscious thoughts use signal-signs to steer the engines in our minds, controlling count- less processes of which we're never much aware. Not understanding how it's done, we learn to gain our ends by sending signals to those great machines, much as the sorcerers of older times used rituals to cast their spells. AA I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.2 SIGNATS AND SIGNS How do we ever understand anything? Almost always, I think, by using one or another kind of analogy-that is, by representing each new thing as though it resembles something we already know. Wh.rr.ul, a new thing s internal workings are too strange or complicated to deal with directly, *. ,.pr\"sent whatevei parts of it we can in terms of more familiar signs' This |.\",, ;. *\"t. .\"\"ti \"\"\".rtv seem similar to some more ordinary thing' It really is a great discovery, the use of ,igrr\"tr, symbols, words, and names. They let our minds transform the strange into the commonPlace. Suppose an alien architect has invented a radically new way to go from on€ room to another' This invention serves the normal functions of a door, but it has a form and mechanism so far outside our experience that to see it' we would nevel recognize it as a door' nor guess how to use it. All its physical details are wrong. It is not what we normally expect a door to be-a hinged, swinging, wooden slab set into a wall. No matter: iust superimpose on its exterior some a.\"-ot^ii\"\", s\"ymbol, icor,, token, word, or sign that can:emind us of its use' Clothe it in a ,.ctrrrg,rl\"i ,[rrp., or add to it a push-plate lettered EXIT in red and white, and every visitor from the planet n\"iitt *iff kno*, without a conscious thought, iust what that pseudoportal's purpose is, and use it as though it were a door' At first it may seem mere tiickery, to assign the symbol for a door to an invention that is not really a door. But *\"1r. al*\"ys in that same predicament. There are no doors inside our minds, only connections among oui signs. To oveistate the case a bit, what we call \"consciousness\" consists of little moie th\"an *.t\"u lists that flash, from time to time, on mental screen displays that other systems use. It is very much like the way the players of computer games use symbols to invoke the processes inside ih.i, \"o-plicated game machines without the slightest under- standing of how theY work. And irhen yo,, \"o*. to think about it, it scarcely could be otherwise! Consider what would happen if we actually could confront the trillion-wire networks in our brains.

Consider how you can\" scarcely see a hammer except as something to hit with, or see a ball except \", ,o*.ihirrg to throw and catch. Why do we see things, less as they are, and more in view of how they can be used? It is because our minds did not evolve to serve as instruments for science o, pirilorophy, but to solve practical problems of nutrition, defense, procreation, and the like. We tend [o ihink of knowledge as good in itself, but knowledge is useful only when we can exploit it to help us reach our goals.

It only seems simple happening. How do you discover things about your mind? You use little bits of theories about how you think, then test them u that thought-experiments don't often lead to the sorts of cler Ask yourself what happens when you try to imagine a rou h\"ppy and sad at the same time. Why is it so hard to descr or draw useful conclusions from them? It is because we get mind-experiments are mind-experiments themselves-and other. Thinking affects our thought People who program computers encounter similar proble tion because of unexpected interactions among their parts I r - - r r r r 5 , programmers have developed special programs for \"debuggirr6, orner programs. But just as in thought-experiments, there is a danger that the program being watched might change the one that's watching it. To prevent this, all modern computers are equipped with special \"interrup- tion\" machinery that detects any other program's attempt to alter a debugging program; when this happens, the culprit is \"frozen\" in its tracks so that the debugging program can examine it. To do this, the interruption machinery must be supplied with a private memory bank that can store enough information to make it possible, later, to restart the frozen program as though nothing had happened. Are brains equipped to do similar things? It was easy to build self-examination systems into computers that did only one thing at a time, but it would be much harder to do in a system that, like the brain, engages many processes at once. The problem is that if you were to freeze only one process without stopping the others, it would change the situation you're trying to examine. However, if you were to stop all those processes all at once, you couldn't experiment on how they interact. Later, we'll see that consciousness is connected with our most immediate memories. This means that there are limits on what consciousness can tell us about itself-because it can't do perfect self-experiments. That would require keeping perfect records of what happens inside one's memory machinery. But any such machinery must get confused by self-experiments that try to find out how it works-since such experiments must change the very records they are trying to inspect! We cannot handle interruptions perfectly. This doesn't mean that conscious- ness cannot be understood, in principle, It only means that to study it, we'll have to use the less direct methods of science, because we cannot simply \"look and see. \" I N S I G H T A N D I N T N O S P E C T I O N\n6.4 E.BRAINS There is one way for a mind to watch itself and still keep track of what's happening. Divide the brain into two parts, A and B. Connect the A-brain's inputs and outputs to the real world- so it can sense what-t\"pp.rs there. But don't connect the B-brain to the outer world at all; instead, connect it so that the A-brain is the B-brain's worldl WORLD A.BRAIN B.BRAIN Now A can see and act upon what happens in the outside world-while B can \"see\" and influence what happens inside A. What uses could there be for such a B? Here are some A- activities that B might learn to recognize and influence' A seems disordered and confused. Inhibit that actittity ' A appears to be repeating itself. Make A stop. Do something else. A do,es something B considers good. Make A remember this' A is occupied wiih too much detail. Make A take a higher-level view. A is not being specific enough. Focus A on lower-level details. This two-p art arrangement could be a step toward having a more \"reflective\" mind-society. The B-brain could do experiments with the A-brain, iust as the A-brain can experiment with the body or with the objicts and people surrounding it. And iust as A can attempt to predict and control what happens in the outer world, B can try to predict and control what A will do. For example, the B-biain could supervise how the A-brain learns, either by making changes in A directly or by influencing A's own learning processes. Even ihough B may have no concept of what A's activities mean in relation to the outer world, it is still possible for B to be useful to A. This is because a B-brain could learn to play a role somewhat like that of a counselor, psychologist, or management consultant, who can assess a client's mental strategy without having to understand all the details of that client's profession. Without having any idea of what A's goals are, B might be able to learn to tell when A is not accomplishing them but only going around in circles or wandering, confused because certain A-agenls are repeating the same things over and over again. Then B might try some simple ,.*\"\"di\"r, like suppreising some of those A-agents. To be sure, this could also result in B's activities becoming nuisances to A. For example, if A had the goal of adding up a long column of numbers, B might start to interfere with this because, from B's point of view, A appears to have become trapped in a repetitive loop. This could cause a person accustomed to more variety to find it difficult to concentrate on such a task and complain of being bored. To the extent that the B-brain knows what is happening in A, the entire system could be considered to be partly \"self-aware.\" However, if we connect A and B to \"watch\" each other too closely, then anything could happen, and the entire system might become unstable. In any case, theie is no reason to stop with only two levels; we could connect a C-brain to watch the B-brain, and so on. I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.5 FROZEN REFI.ECTION Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past. -T. S. Error No supervisor can know everything that all its agents do. There's simply never time enough. Each bureaucrat sees but a fraction of what happens underneath its place in the pyramid of information flow. The best subordinates are those that work most quietly. Indeed,-[hat's why we build administrative pyramids for jobs we don't know how to do or don't have time to do ourselves. It is also why so many of our thoughts must hide beyond our consciousness. Good scientists never try to learn too much at once. Instead, they select particular aspects of a situation, observe carefully, and make records. Experimental records are \"frozen phenom- ena.\" They let us take all the time we need to make our theories. But how could we do the same thing inside the mind? We'd need some kind of memory in which to keep such records safe. We'll see how this could work when we come to the chapters on memory. We'll conjecture that your brain contains a host of agents called \"K-lines,\" which you can use to make records of what some of your brain-agents are doing at a certain moment. Later, when you activate the same K-lines, this restores those agents to their previous states. This makes you \"remember\" part of your previous mental state, by making those parts of your mind do just what they did before. Then, the other parts of your mind will react as though the same events were happening again! Of course, such memories will always be incomplete, since nothing could have capacity enough to record every detail of its own state. (Otherwise, it would have to be larger than itself.) Since we can't remember everything, each individual mind faces the same problem that scien- tists always face: they have no foolproof way to know, before the fact, what are the most important things to notice and record. Using the mind to examine itself is like science in another way. fust as physicists cannot see the atoms they talk about, psychologists can't watch the processes they try to examine. We only \"know\" such things through their effects. But the problem is worse where the mind is con- cerned, since scientists can read each other's notes, but different parts of the mind can't read each other's memories. We've now seen several reasons why we cannot simply watch our minds by sitting still and waiting till our vision clears. The only course left for us is to study the mind the way scientists do when something is too large or small to see-by building theories based on evidence. Make a guess; test it with a shrewd experiment; collect one's thoughts and guess again. When intro- spection seems to work, it's not because we've found a magic way to see inside ourselves. Instead, it means that we've done some well-designed experiment. 60 I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.6 MOMENTARY IUENTAT TIME What do you think you're thinking now? You might reply, \"Why, just the. thoughts I'm ttrinting now!\" And that makes sense, in ordinary life, where \"now\" means \"at this moment in time.\" Fut the meaning of \"now\" is far less clear for an agent inside a society' It takes some time for changes in one part of a mind to affect the other parts. There's always some delaY' For example, suppose you meet your friend Jack. Your agencies for Yoices and Faces may ,eiognirela\"t'r uoi\".,nd face, and both send messages to an agency Names, which may recall Jackl name. BrftYoices may also send a \"word-message\" to Quotes, a language-based agency ih\"t hrr a way to remember phrases fack has said before, while Faces may also send a message to Places, an agency concerned witir space, which might recall some earlier place in which |ack's face was seen. So afthough real time proceeds from bftto right, to PLACES, the moments of the pastform slanting lines. Now suppose we could ask both Places and Quotes which had happened first, seeing fack or hearing hii voice? We'd get two different answers! Places will first detect the face-while Quotes will first detect the voice. The seeming order of events depends upon which message reached each agent first-so the seeming sequence of events differs from one agent to another. Each agent will react in its own, slightly different way-because it has been affected by a slightly different \"causal history,\" which spreads like a wave into the past. It is simply impossible, in general, for any agent P to know for certain what another agent Q is doing at precisely the same time. The best that P can do is send a query straight to Q and hope that Q can get a truthful message back before other agents change Q's state-or change its message along the way. No portion of a mind can ever know everything that is happening at the same time in all the other agencies. Because of this, each agency must have at least a slightly different sense both of what has happened in the past-and of what is happening \"now. \" Each different agent of the mind lives in a slightly different world of time. ::t \"'t\"t PLACES receives sigrtals first from ,,,,,, FACES, because messages from ' VOICES first pass through NAMES. I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.7 THE CAUSAT NOYY To know anything [said the poet) we must know its effects; to see men u)e must know their works, that we may know what reason has dictated, or passion has incited, and find what are the most powerful motives of action. To iufue rightly of the present, we must oppose it to the past; for all iudgment is comparative, and of the future nothing can be known. The truth is, that no mind is much employed upon the present: recollection and anticipation fill up almost all our moments. Our passions are ioy and grief, love and hatred, hope and fear; even love and hatred respect the past, for the cause must have been before the effect. - S a l r u e r l o H N s o N Our everyday ideas about the progression of mental time are wrong: they leave no room for the fact that every agent has a different causal history. To be sure, those different pasts are intermixed over longer spans of time, and every agent is eventually influenced by what has happened in the common, remote history of its society. But that's not what one means by \"now.\" The problem is with the connections between the moment-to-moment activities of largely separate agencies. When a pin drops, you might say, \"f iust heard a pin drop.\" But no one says, \"I hear a pin dropping.\" Our speaking agencies know from experience that the physical episode of pin drop- ping will be over before you can even start to speak. But you would say, \"I am in lore,\" rather than \"f was iust in lote,\" because your speaking agencies know that the agencies involved with personal attachments work at a slower pace, with states that may persist for months or years. And, in between, when someone asks, \"What sorts of feelings haw you now?\" we often find our half-formed answers wrong before they can be expressed, as other feelings intervene. What seems only a moment to one agency may seem like an era to another. Our memories are only indirectly linked to physical time. We have no absolute sense of when a memorable event \"actually\" happened. At best, we can only know some temporal relations between it and certain other events. You might be able to recall that X and Y occurred on different days but be unable to determine which of those days came earlier. And many memo- ries seem not to be linked to intervals of time at all-like knowing that four comes after three, or that \"l am myself.\" The slower an agency operates-that is, the longer the intervals between each change of state-the more external signals can arrive inside those intervals. Does this mean that the outside world will appear to move faster to a slow agency than to a faster agency? Does life seem swift to tortoises, but tedious to hummingbirds? 62 I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.8 THINKING WTTHOUT THINKING fust as we walk without thinking, we think without thinking! We don't know how our muscles ^\"k. ,r, walk-nor do we know much more about the agencies that do our mental work. When yo\" tt\"u. a hard problem to solve, you think about it for a time. Then, perh.aps, the answer ,..-, to come all at once, and you say, \"Aha, I've gOt it. l'll do such dnd Such'\" But if someone were to ask how you found the solution, you could rarely say more than things like the follow- ing: \"I suddenly realized . . .\" \"l iust got this idea . .\" \"lt occuned to me that . . .\" If we could really sense the workings of our minds, we wouldn't act so often in accord with motives we don't suspect. We wouldn't have such varied and conflicting theories for psychol- ogy. And when we're asked how people get their good ideas, we wouldn't be reduced to meta- pf,o.t about \"ruminating,\" and \"digesting,\" \"conceiving\" and \"giving birth\" to concepts-as ihough our thoughts were anywhere but in the head. If we could see inside our minds, we'd surely have more useful things to say. Many people seem absolutely certain that no computer could ever be sentient, conscious, self-wilied, oi itt \"ny other way \"aware\" of itself. But what makes everyone so sure that they themselves possess fhose admirable qualities? It's true that if we're sure of anything at all, it is that \"I'm dwore-hence I'm dwdre.\" Yet what do such convictions really mean? [f self-awareness means to know what's happening inside one's mind, no realist could maintain for long that people have much insight, in the literal sense of seeing-in. Indeed, the evidence that we are ielf-aware-that is, that we have any special aptitude for finding out what's happening inside ourselves-is very weak indeed. It is true that certain people have a special excellence at assessing the attitudes and motivations of other persons (and, more rarely, of themselves). But this does not justify the belief that how we learn things about people, including ourselves, is fundamentally different from how we learn about other things. Most of the understandings we call \"insights\" are merely variants of our other ways to \"figure out\" what's happening. I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N 63\n6.9 HEADS IN THE CTOIIDS What we call a mind is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united together by certain relations and suppos'd, tho' falsely, to be endow'd with a perfect simplicity and identity. -Devro Hurr,rn We'll take the view that nothing can have meaning by itself, but only in relation to whatever other meanings we already know. One might complain that this has the quality of the old question, \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\" If each thing one knows depends on other things one knows, isn't that like castles built on air? What keeps them from all falling down, if none are tied to solid ground? Well, first, there's nothing basically wrong with the idea of a society in which each part lends meaning to the other parts. Some sets of thoughts are much like twisted ropes or woven cloths in which each strand holds others both together and apart. Consider all the music tunes you know. Among them you can surely find two tunes of which you like each one the more because of how it's similar to or different from the other one. Besides, no human mind remains entirely afloat. Later we'll see how our conceptions of space and time can be based entirely on networks of relationships, yet can still reflect the structure of reality. If every mind builds somewhat different things inside itself, how can any mind communicate with a different mind? In the end, surely, communication is a matter of degree but it is not always lamentable when different minds don't understand each other perfectly. For then, provided some communication remains, we can share the richness of each other's thoughts. What good would other people be if we were all identical? In any case, the situation is the same insiile your mind-since even you yourself can never know precisely what you mean! How useless any thought would be if, afterward, your mind returned to the selfsame state. But that never happens, because every time we think about a certain thing, our thoughts go off in different ways. The secret of what anything medns to us depends on how we've connected it to all the other things we know. That's why it's almost always wrong to seek the \"real meaning\" of anything. A thing with iust one meaning has scarcely any meaning at all. An idea with a single sense can lead you along only one track. Then, if anything goes wrong, it just gets stuck-a thought that sits there in your mind with nowhere to go. That's why, when someone learns something \"by rots\"-that is, with no sensible connections-we say that they \"don't really understand.\" Rich meaning-networks, however, give you many different ways to go: if you can't solve a problem one way, you can try another. True, too many indiscriminate connections will turn a mind to mush. But well-connected meaning-structures let you turn ideas around in your mind, to consider alternatives and envision things from many perspectives until you find one that works. And that's what we mean by thinking! 64 I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.10 WORTDS OUT OF MIND AII these beautiful, evolutionary qualities spontaneously blossom in indiyidual and collective life . . . where consciousness is found identified with the unified field of all the laws of nature' - B u L L s r l n , M e s e n l s s t I N t n R N l r t o N a I - U N I v s n s I r v , 1 9 8 4 There is no singularly real world of thought; each mind evolves its own internal universe. The worlds of thought that we appear to like the best are those where goals and actions seem to mesh in regions large enough to spend our lives in-and thus become a Buddhist, or Republican, oi poet, oi topologist. Some mental starting points grow into gteat, coherent continents. In certain parts of mathematics, science, and philosoPhy, a relatively few but clear ideas may lead into an endless realm of complex yet consistent new structures. Yet even in mathematics, a handful of seemingly innocent rules can lead to complications far beyond our grasp. Thus we feel we understand perfectly the rules of addition and multiplication-yet when iye mix them together, we encounter problems about prime numbers that have remained unsolved for centuries. Minds also make up pleasant worlds of practical affairs-which work because we make them work, by putting things in order there. In the physical realm, we keep our books and clothes in self-made shelves and cabinets-thus building artificial boundaries to keep our things from interacting very much. Similarly, in mental realms, we make up countless artificial schemes to force things to seem orderly, by specifying legal codes, grammar rules and traffic laws. When growing up in such a world, it all seems right and natural-and only scholars and historians iecall the mass of precedents and failed experiments it took to make it work so well. These \"natural\" worlds are actually more complex than the technical worlds of philosophy. They're far too vast to comprehend-except where we impose on them the rules we make. There is also a different and more sinister way to make the world seem orderly, in which the mind has merely found a way to simplify itself. This is what we must suspect whenever some idea seems to explain too much. Perhaps no problem was actually solved at all; instead, ihe mind has merely found some secondary pathway in the brain, through which one can mechan- ically dislodge each doubt and difference from its rightful place! This may be what happens in some of those experiences that leave a person with a sense of revelation-in a state in which no doubts remain, or with a vision of astounding clarity-yet unable to recount any details. Some accident of mental stress has temporarily suppressed the capacity to question, doubt, or probe. One remembers that no questions went unanswered but forgets that none were asked! One can acquire certainty only by amputating inquiry. When victims of these incidents become compelled to recapture them, their lives and person* alities are sometimes permanently changed. Then others, seeing the radiance in their eyes and hearing of the glory to be found, are drawn to follow them. But to offer hospitality to paradox is like leaning toward a precipice. You can find out what it is like by falling in, but you may not be able to fall out again. Once contradiction finds a home, few minds can spurn the sense- destroying force of slogans such as \"all is one.\" I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.I I IN.SIGHT Suppose that while you walked and talked, you could watch the signals that traverse your brain. Would they make any sense to you? Many people have done experiments to make such signals audible and visible, by using biofeedback devices. This often helps a person to learn to control various muscles and glands that are not usually under conscious control. But it never leads to comprehending how their hidden circuits work. Scientists encounter similar problems when they use electronic instruments to tap into brain signals. This has led to a good deal of knowledge about how nervous systems work-but those insights and understandings never came from observation by itself. One cannot use data with- out having at least the beginnings of some theory or hypothesis. Even if we could directly sense all the interior details of mental life, it wouldn't tell us how to understand them. It might even make that enterprise more difficult, by overwhelming our capacity to interpret what we see. The causes and functions of what we observe are not themselves things we can observe. Where do we get the ideas we need? Most of our concepts come from the communities in which we're raised. Even the ideas we \"get\" for ourselves come from communities-this time, the ones inside our heads. Brains don't manufacture thoughts in the direct ways that muscles exert forces or ovaries make estrogensl instead, to get a good idea, one must engage huge organizations of submachines that do a vast variety of jobs. Each human cranium contains hundreds of kinds of computers, developed over hundreds of millions of years of evolution, each with a somewhat different architecture. Each specialized agency must learn to call on other specialists that can serve its purposes. Certain sections of the brain distinguish the sounds of voices from other sorts of sounds; other specialized agencies distinguish the sights of faces from other types of objects. No one knows how many different such organs lie in our brains. But it is almost certain that they all employ somewhat different types of programming and forms of representation; they share no common language code. If a mind whose parts use different languages and modes of thought attempted to look inside itself, few of those agencies would be able to comprehend one another. It is hard enough for people who speak different human languages to communicate, and the signals used by different portions of the mind are surely even less similar. If agent P asked any question of an unrelated agent Q, how could Q sense what was asked, or P understand its reply? Most pairs of agents can't communicate at all. 66 I N S I C H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.12 INTERNAT COMMUNICATION If agents can't communicate, how is it that people can-in spite of having_such different backgftunds, thoughts, and purposes? The answer is that we overestimate how much we actua']ly communicate. Instead, dLspite those seemingly important differences, much of what we do is based on common knowledge and experience. So even though we can scarcely speak at all about what happens in our lower-level mental processes, we can exploit their common heritage. Although wL can't express what we mean, we can often cite various examples to indicale how to connect structures we're sure must already exist inside the listener's mind. In short, we can often indicate which sorts of thoughts to think, even though we can't express how they operate. The words and symbols we use to summarize our higherJevel goals and plans are not the same as the signals used to control lower-level ones. So when our higherJevel agencies attempt to probe into the 6ne details of the lower-level submachines that they exploit, they cannot unierstand what's happening. This must be why our language-agencies cannot express such things as how we balance on our bicycles, distinguish pictures from real things, or fetch our facts from memory. We find it particularly hard to use our language skills to talk about the parts of the mind that learned such skills as balancing, seeing, and remembering, before we started to learn to speak. \"Meaning\" itself is relative to size and scale: it makes sense to talk about a meaning only in a system large enough to have many meanings. For smaller systems, that concept seems vacant and superfluous. For example, Builder's agents require no sense of meaning to do their work; Add merely has to turn on Get and Put. Then Get and Put do not need any subtle sense of what those turn-on signals \"psx1\"-fecause they're wired up to do only what they're wired up to do. In general, the smaller an agency is, the harder it will be for other agencies to compre- hend its tiny \"language.\" The smaller two languages dre, the harder it will be to translate between them. This is not because there are too many meanings, but because there are too few. The fewer things an agent does, the less likely that what another agent does will cone- spond to any of those things. And if two agents have nothing in common, no translation is conceivable. In the more familiar difficulty of translating between human languages, each word has many meanings, and the main problem is to narrow them down to something they share. But in the case of communication between unrelated agents, narrowing down cannot help if the agents have nothing in common from the siart. I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\nl 6.13 SELF-KNOVYTEDGE IS DANGEROUS To \"know oneself\" more perfectly might seem to promise something powerful and good. But there are fallacies concealed behind that happy thought. No doubt, a mind that wants to change itself could benefit from knowing how it works. But such knowledge might as easily encourage us to wreck ourselves-if we had ways to poke our clumsy mental fingers into the tricky circuits of the mind's machinery. Could this be why our brains force us to play those games of mental hide and seek? lust see how prone we are to risk experiments that change ourselves; how fatally we're drawn to drugs, to meditation, music, even conversation-all powerful addictions that can change our very personalities. fust see how everyone is entranced by any promise to transgress the bounds of normal pleasure and reward. In ordinary life, our pleasure systems help us learn-and, therefore, to behave ourselves- by forcing checks and balances on us. Why, for example, do we become bored when doing the same thing over and over, even if that activity was pleasant at first? This appears to be one property of our pleasure systems; without enough variety, they tend to satiate. Every learning machine must have some such protective scheme, since otherwise it could get trapped into endlessly repeating the same activity. We are fortunate to be equipped with mechanisms that keep us from wasting too much time, and it is fortunate, too, that we find it hard to suppress such mechanisms. lf we could deliberately seize control of our pleasure systems, we could reproduce the pleasure of success without the need for any actual accomplishment. And that would be the end of everything. What prevents such meddling? Our minds are bound by many self-constraints. For example, we find it hard to determine what's happening inside the mind. Later, when we talk about infant development, we'll see that even if our inner eyes could see what's there, we'd find it singularly hard to change the agents we might want most to change-the ones that, in our infancy, helped shape our longestJasting self-ideals. These agents are hard to change because of their special evolutionary origin. The long-term stability of many other mental agencies depends on how slowly we change our images of what we ought to be like. Few of us would survive if, left to random chance, our most adventurous impulses could tamper freely with the basis of our personalities. Why would that be such a bad thing to do? Because an ordinary \"change of mind\" can be reversed if it leads to a bad result. But when you change your self-ideals-then nothing is left to turn you back. Sigmund Freud theorized that each person's growth is governed by unconscious needs to please, placate, oppose, or terminate our images of parental authority. If we recognized the influence of those old images, however, we might consider them too infantile or too unworthy to tolerate and seek to replace them with something better. But then what would we substitute for them-once we divested ourselves of all those ties to instinct and society? We'd each end up as instruments of even more capricious sorts of self-invented goals. 68 I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N\n6.t4 CONFUSION It's mainly when our systems fail that consciousness becomes engaged. For example, we walk and talk without much sense of how we actually do those things. But a person with an iniured leg may, for the first time, begin to formulate theories about how walking works (\"To turn to tie teft, I'll have to push myself that way\") and then perhaps consider which muscles might accomplish that goal. When we recognize that we're confused, we begin to reflect on how our minds solve problems and engage the little we know about our strategies of thought. Then we find ourselves saying things like this: \"Now I must get organized. Why can't I concentrate on the important questions and not get distracted by those other nonessential details?\" Paradoxically, it is smart to realize that one is confused-as opposed to being confused without knowing it. For that stimulates us to apply our intellect to altering or repairing the defective process. Yet we dislike and disparage the sense of confusion, not appreciating the quality of this recognition. However, once your B-brains make you start to ask yourself \"What was I really attempting to do?\" yot can exploit that as an opportunity to change your goals or change how you describe your situation. That way, you can escape the distress of feeling trapped because there seem to be no adequate alternatives. The conscious experience of confusion can resemble pain; perhaps this is because of how they both impel us to discover ways to escape from a predicament. The difference is that confusion is directed against a person's own failing state of mind, whereas pain reflects exterior disturbances. In either case, internal processes must be demolished and rebuilt. Both confusion and pain have injurious effects when they lead us to abandon goals on larger scales than appropriate: \"The entirc subiect makes me feel ill. Perhaps I should abandon the whole proiect, occupation, or relationship.\" But even such dispiriting thoughts can serve as probes for finding other agencies that might be engaged for help. I N S I G H T A N D I N T R O S P E C T I O N 69\nl cnAPrEP 7 PROBLEMS AND GOALS\n7.I INTEI.TIGENCE Many people insist on having some definition of \"intelligence'\" CRITIC; How can we be sure that things like plants and stones, or storms and strectms, are not intelligent in ways that we haye not yet conceived? It doesn't seem a good idea to use the same word for different things, unless one has in mind important ways in *hich they are the same. Plants and streams don't seem very good at solving the kinds of problems we regard as needing intelligence. CRITIC: Whot's so special about solying problems? And why don't you define \"intelligence\" precisely, so that we cdn dgree on what we're discussing? That isn't a good idea, either. An author's job is using words the ways other people do, not telling others how to use them. In the few places the word \"intelligence\" appears in this book, it merely means what people usually mean-the ability to solve hard problems. CRITIC; Then you should define what you mean by d\"hdrd\" problem. We know it took a lot of human intelligence to build the pyramids-yet little coral reef ani- mals build impressive structures on even larger scales. So don't you have to consider them intelligent? Isn't it hard to build gigantic coral reefs? Yes, but it is only an illusion that animals can \"solve\" those problems! No individual bird discoyers a way to fly. Instead, each bird exploits a solution that evolved from countless reptile years of evolution. Similarly, although a person might find it very hard to design an oriole's nest or a beaver's dam, no oriole or beaver ever figures out such things at all. Those animals don't \"solve\" such problems themselves; they only exploit procedures available within their complicated gene-built brains. CRITIC: Then wouldn't you be forced to say that evolution itself must be intelli- gent, since it solved those problems of flying and building reefs and nests? No, because people also use the word \"intelligence\" to emphasize swiftness and efficiency. Evolution's time rate is so slow that we don't see it as intelligent, even though it finally produces wonderful things we ourselves cannot yet make. Anyway, it isn't wise to treat an old, vague word like \"intelligence\" as though it must define any definite thing. Instead of trying to say what such a word \"means,\" it is better simply to try to explain how we use it. Our minds contain processes that enable us to solve problems we consider difficult. \"Intelligence\" is our name for whichever of those processes we don't yet understand. Some people dislike this \"definition\" because its meaning is doomed to keep changing as we learn more about psychology. But in my view that's exactly how it ought to be, because the very concept of intelligence is like a stage magician's trick. Like the concept of \"the unexplored regions of Africa,\" it disappears as soon as we discover it. P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\n7.2 UNCOMMON SENSE We've all heard iokes about how stupid present-day computers are. They send us bills and checks for zero dollars and zero cents. They don't mind working in endless loops, repeating the same thing a billion times. Their total lack of common sense is another reason people think that no machine could have a mind. It is interesting to note that some of the earliest computer programs excelled at what people consider to be \"expert\" skills. A 1956 program solved hard problems in mathematical logic, and a 196l program solved college-level problems in calculus. Yet not till the 1970s could we construct robot programs that could see and move well enough to arrange children's building- blocks into simple towers and playhouses. Why could we make programs do grown-up things before we could make them do childish things? The answer may seem paradoxical: much of \"expert\" adult thinking is actually simpler than what is involved when ordinary children play! Why is it easier to program what experts do than what children do? What people vaguely call common sense is actually more intricate than most of the technical expertise we admire. Neither that \"expert\" program for logic nor the one for calculus embodied more than a hundred or so \"facts\"-2n61 most of them were rather similar to one another. Yet these were enough to solve collegeJevel problems. In contrast, think of all the different ftinds of things a child must know merely to build a house of blocks-a process that involves knowl- edge of shapes and colors, space and time, support and balance, and an ability to keep track of what one is doing. To be considered dn \"expert,\" one needs a large amount of knowledge of only a relatively few varieties. In contrast, dn ordinary person's \"common sense\" involves a much larger variety of different types of knowledge-and this requires more complicated management sy stems. There is a simple reason why it is easier to acquire specialized knowledge than commonsense knowledge. Each type of knowledge needs some form of \"representation\" and a body of skills adapted to using that style of representation. Once that investment has been made, it is rela- tively easy for a specialist to accumulate further knowledge, provided the additional expertise is uniform enough to suit the same style of representation. A lawyer, doctor, architect, or com- poser who has learned to deal with a range of cases in some particular field finds it relatively easy to acquire more knowledge of a similar character. Think how much longer it would take a single person to learn to deal competently with a few diseas es and several kinds of law cases and a small variety of architectural blueprints and a few orchestral scores. The greater variety of representations would make it much harder to acquire the \"same amount\" of knowledge. For each new domain, our novice would have to learn another type of representation and new skills for using it. It would be like learning many different languages, each with its own grammar, lexicon, and idioms. When seen this way, what children do seems all the more remarkable, since so many of their actions are based upon their own inventions and discoveries. 72 P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\n7.3 THE P{.IE;ZLE PRINCIPIJ Many people reason that machines do only what they're programmed to do--and hence can never be creative or original. The trouble is that this argument presumes what it purports to show: that you can't prolram a machine to be creative! In fact, it is surprisingly easy to program , .o-put\", so that lt tr'iff proceed to do more different things than any programmer could i-agi\"e in advance. This is possible because of what we'll call the \"puzzle principle.\" Ptzzle Principle: We can progrdm a computer to solve any problem by trial and error, without-knowing how to solve it in advance, profided only that we have a way to recognize when the problem is solved. By \"trial and error\" we mean programming the machine systematically to generate all possible structures within some univeri. of possibilities. For example, suppose you wished to have a robot machine that could build a bridge across a stream. The most efficient program for this would simply execute a specific procedure, planned out in advance, to precisely place some boards and nails. Of courie, you couldn't write such a program unless you already knew how to build a bridge. But consider the alternative below, which is sometimes called the generate and test method. It consists of writing a two-part program. Generate. The first process simply produces, one after another, every possible ar' rangement of the boards and nails. At first, you might expect such a program to be hard to write. But it turns out to be surbrisingly easy, once you appreciate that there is no requirement for each arrangement to make dny sense whatsoever! Test. The second part of the process examines each arrangement to see whether the problem has been solved. If the goal were to build a dam, the fast is simply whether it holds back the stream. If the goal were to build a bridge, the test is simply whether it sPans the stream. This possibility makes us reexamine all our old ideas about intelligence and creativity, since it meani that, in principle, at least, we can make machines solve any problems whose solutions we can recognize. This is rarely practical, however. Consider that there must be a thousand ways to attach two boards, a million ways to connect three of them, and a billion ways to nail four boards together. It would take inconceivably long before the puzzle principle produced a workable bridge. But it does help, philosophically, to replace our feeling of mystery about creativity by more specific and concrete questions about the efficiency of processes. The main problem with our bridge-building machine is the lack of connection between its generator and its test. Without some notion of progress toward a goal, it is hard to do better than mindless chance. P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S I J\n7.4 PROBIfiM SOTVING In principle, we can use the \"generate and test\" method-that is, trial and error-to solve any problem whose solution we can recognize. But in practice, it can take too long for even the most powerful computer to test enough possible solutions. Merely assembling a simple house from a dozen wooden blocks would require searching through more possibilities than a child could try in a lifetime. Here is one way to improve upon blind trial-and-error search. The Progress Principle: Any process of exhaustiye search can be greatly reduced if we possess some wdy to detect when \"progress\" hds been made. Then we can trace a path toward a solution, iust as a person can climb an unfamiliar hill in the dark- by feeling around, at ewry step, to find the direction of steepest ascent. Many easy problems can be solved this way, but for a hard problem, it may be almost as difficult to recognize \"progress\" as to solve the problem itself. Without a larger overview, that \"hill climber\" may get stuck forever on some minor peak and never find the mountaintop. There is no foolproof way to avoid this. Goals and Subgoals.The most powerful way we know for discovering how to solve a hard problem is to find a method that splits it into several simpler ones, each of which can be solved sePdrdtely. Much research in the field called Artificial lntelligence has been concerned with finding methods machines can use for splitting a problem into smaller subproblems and then, if nec- essary, dividing these into yet smaller ones. In the next few sections we'll see how this can be done by formulating our problems in terms of \"goals.\" Using Knowledge. The most efficient way to solve a problem is to already know how to solve it. Then one can avoid search entirely. Accordingly, another branch of Artificial Intelligence research has sought to find ways to embody knowledge in machines. But this problem itself has several parts: we must discover how to acquire the knowledge we need, we must learn how to represent it, and, finally, we must develop processes that can exploit our knowledge effectively. To accomplish all that, our mem- ories must represent, in preference to vast amounts of small details, only those relationships that may help us reach our goals. This research has led to many practical \"knowledge-based\" problem-solving systems. Some of these are often called \"expert systems\" because they're based on imitating the methods of particular human practitioners. A curious phenomenon emerged from this research. It often turned out easier to program machines to solve specialized problems that educated people considered hard-such as playing chess or proving theorems about logic or geometry-than to make machines do things that most people considered easy-such as building toy houses with children's blocks. This is why I've emphasized so many \"easy\" problems in this book. 74 P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\n7.5 I,.EARNING ATitD MEMORY There is an old and popular idea that we learn only what we are rewarded for' Some psychol- ogists have claimed that human l\"\"rrrirrg i, fased entirely on \"reinforcement\" by reward: that even when we train ourselves with no external inducements, we are still learning from reward -only now in the foim of signals from inside ourselves. But we cannot trust an argument that assumes what it purports to prove, and in any case' when we try to use thjs idea to explain how oeople learn to solve hard problems, *. \"rr\"L,rnter a deadly ciicularity. You first must be able io io ,o*uthing before you can be rewatded for doing,it!- This circularity *a, ,,o great problem when lvanFavlov studied conditioned reflexes nearly a century ago, because in f,is experiments the animals never needed to produce new kinds of behavior; they only had to link new stimuli to old behaviors. Decades later, Pavlov's research was extended by the Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner, who recognized that higher-animals did indeed sometimes exhibit new for-, J behavior, which he called \"operants.\" Skinner's experiments confirmed that when a certain operant is followed by a reward, it is likely to reappear mor. fr.qu..,ttv on later occasions. He also discovered that this kind of learning has much larger effects if the animal cannot predict w!e1 it witl be rewarded' Under names like .,operant conditioning\" and \"behavior modification,\" Skinner's discoveries had a wide influence i\"'pry\"f.ofogy and eJucation, but never led to explaining how brains produce new operants' Furthermore, few of these animal experiments shed much light on how humans learn to form and carry out their co*pt.* plans; the trouble is that othei animals can scarcely learn such things at all. Those twin ideas- rewardlsuccess and punishlfailure-do -not- explain enough ;;i how people f.\"r\" i, f-a\"\". the new ideas that enable them to solve difficult problems that could not ottrer*ise be solved without many lifetimes of ineffectual trial and error' The answer must l.ii in learning betteruoy, io learn. ln order to discuss these things, we'll have to start by using many ordiiary words like goal, reward, leaming, thinking, recognizing, Iiking, wanting, imigining, and remembering-a11based on old and vague ideas' we'll find that most ,,r\"h *o.Jr\"-\"r[1\" replaced by new distinctions and ideas. Still, there's something common to them all: in order to iolue any hard problem, we must use various kinds of memo- ries. At .\"\"h ..,o*.rri, *. *,rrt keep track of what we've iust done-or else we might repeat the same st.p, ou., \"r,a ou.t again. Alro, *. must somehow maintain our goals-or we'll end 6j;i;g pointless things. Fina'lly, once our problem is-solved, we need access to records of hfw it *\".r dott., for use when similar problems arise in the future. Much of this Uoot will be concerned with memory-that is, with records.of the mental past' wirv, r,or, and when should such records be made? When the human brain solves a hard problem, many millions of agents and processes are involved. Which agents could be wise enough to guess *h\"i \"hr.,ge\"s should then be made? The highJevel agents can't know such tf,i\"gi, the/scarce\\ know uThich lower-level processes exist. Nor can lower-level agents know which of their actions helped us to reach our highJevel goals; they scarcely-know that higher- l.u\"igoa, exist. The rg.rrti\", that move our legs aren't concerned with whether we are walking towar? home or towaid work-nor do the agents involved with such destinations know any- it i\"g \"f controlling individual muscle units. Where in the mind are iudgments made about which agents merit Praise or blame? P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\n7.6 REINFORCEMENT AND REWARD For learning to take place, each play of the game must yield much more information. This is achieved by breiking the problei ;ii' components. The unit of success is the goar. rf a goal is achieved, its subgoals are reinforced; if not, they are inhibited. - A l r n N N s w E r r One thing is sure: we always find it easier to do things we've done before. What happens in our minds to make that possible? Here's one idea: In\" the course of solving some problem, certain agents must have aroused certain other agents. So let's take \"reward\" to mean that if agent A has been involved-in arousing agent B, the effect of reward ir, ro-\"rrow, to make it easier for A to arouse B in the future \"nd ,ho, perhaps, to rnake it harder for A to arouse other agents' At one time, I was so taken with this idea thit I designed a machine calied the Srrarc, which learned according to this principle; it was composed oi forty agents, \"\".rr-\"orrrr.cted to several others, more or-less at random, through a \"r6ward\" system tf,at, when activated after each success, made each agent more likely to r'earouse the same recipients at later times. We presented this machine with problems like learnirrg to fir,d a path th;;;;h; maze while avoiding a hostile predator. -It quickly learned to solve eisy problems but never could learn to solve hard problems like building towers or playing chess. Iib\"\"\"-\" clear that, in order to solve complicated problems, anv machine of limited size must be able to reuse iir;;;;i, in different ways in different contexts-as See must do when involved in two concurrent tasks. But when the Snarc tried to learn its way through a complicated maze, a typical agent might suggest a good direction to move in at one moment, then suggest a bad direction at another moment. Later, when we rewarded.it.for doing something rJlk.d, both those decisions became more likely-and all those \"goods\" and \"bads\" tended [o cancel one another out! - This poses a dilemma in designing machines that learn by \"reinforcing\" the connections between agents' In the cours_e of_solving a hard problem, one will usually tri r.ulr\"r bad moves befole finding a good one-for this is virtually what we medn by calling \" pfif.\"-, .,hard.,,To avoid learning those bad moves, we could design a machine to reinforle only what happened in the last few moments before success. But such a machine would be able to learn only to solve problems whose solutions require iust a few steps. Alternatively, we could design the reward to work over longer spans of time; however, thit would not only ,.*\"rd ihe bad deci- sions along with the good but would also erase other things that it had previourty l.\".rr.d to do. We cannot learn to solve hard problems by indiscriminately reinforcing agents or their connec- tions. Why is it that among all the animals, only the great-brained relativJs of man can learn to solve problems that require many steps or involve uling the same agencies for different pur- poses? We'll seek the answer in the policies our agencies use for accoriplishing goals. You might argue that a beaver goes through many steps to build a dn-, ,Jd\"oes a colony of termites when it builds its complex castle nest. However, these wonderful animals do not learn such accomplishments as individuals but use the procedures that have become encoded in their species' genes over millions of years of evolution. You cannot train a beaver to build a termite nest or teach termites to build beaver dams. 76 P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\n7.7 TOCAT RESPONSIBIIJTY Suppose that Alice, who owns a wholesale store, asks the manager, Bill, to increase sales. Bill instructs the salesman, Charles, to sell more radios. Charles secures a large order, on profitable terms. But then the firm can't actually deliver those radios, because they are in short supply. Who is to blame? Alice would be justified in punishing Bill, rvhose job it was to verify the inventory. The question is, should Charles be rewarded? From Alice's viewpoint, Charles's actions have only disgraced the firm. But from Bill's viewpoint, Charles succeeded in his mission to get sales, and it wasn't his fault that this failed to accomplish his supervisor's goal. Consider this example from two perspectives-call them \"local reward\" and \"global reward.\" The Local scheme rewards each agent that helps accomplish its supertisor's goal. So BilI rewards Charles, even though Charles's action served no higher-level goal. The Global scheme rewards only agents that help accomplish top-level goals. So Charles gets no reward at all. It is easy to invent machinery to embody local learning policies, since each assignment of credit depends only on the relation between an agent and its supervisor. It is harder to imple- ment a global learning scheme because this requires machinery to find out which agents are connected all the way to the original goal by unbroken chains of accomplished subgoals. The local scheme is relatively generous to Charles by rewarding him whenever he accomplishes what is asked of him. The global scheme is much more parsimonious. It dispenses no credit whatever to Charles, even though he does as his supervisor requests, unless his action also contributes to the topJevel enterprise. In such a scheme, agents will often learn nothing at all from their experiences. Accordingly, global policies lead to learning more slowly. Both schemes have various advantages. The cautiousness of the global policy is appropriate when mistakes are very dangerous or when the system has plenty of time. This can lead to more \"responsible\" behavior-since it could make Charles learn, in time, to check the inventory for himself instead of slavishly obeying Bill. The global policy does not permit one to justify a bad action with \"I was only obeying the orders of my superior.\" On the other side, the local policy can lead to learning many more different things at once, since each agent can constantly improve its ability to achieve its local goals, regardless of how they relate to those of other portions of the mind. Surely our agencies have several such options. Which ones they use may depend, from moment to moment, upon the states of other agencies whose iob it is to learn, themselves , which learning strategies to use, depending on the circumstances. The global scheme requires some way to distinguish not only which agents'activities have helped to solve a problem, but also which agents helped with which subproblems. For example, in the course of building a tower, you might find it useful to push a certain block aside to make room for another one. Then you'd want to remember that pushing can help in building a tower -but if you were to conclude that pushing is a generally useful thing to do, you'd never get another tower built. When we solve a hard problem, it usually is not enough to say that what a certain agent did was \"good\" or \"bad\" for the entire enterprise; one must make such judgments depend, to some extent, on the local circumstances-that is, on how the work of each agent helped or hindered the work of related agents. The effect of rewarding an agent must be to make that agent react in ways that help to accomplish some specific goal-without too much interference with other, more important goals. All this is simple common sense, but in order to pursue it further, we'll have to clarify our language. We have all experienced the pursuit of goals, but experience is not the same as understanding. What is a goal, and how can a machine have one? P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S 77\n7.E DIFFERENCE-ENGINES Whenever we talk about a\"goal,\" we mix a thousand meanings in one word. Goals are linked to all the unknown agencies that are engaged whenever we try to change ourselves or the outside world. If \"goal\" involves so many things, why tie them all to a single word? Here's some of what we usually expect when we think that someone has a goal: A \"goal-diren\" system does not seem to react directly to the stimuli or situations it encounters. Instead, it treats the things it finds as obiects to exploit, avoid, or ignore, as though it were concerned with something else that doesn't yet exist. When any disturbdnce or obstacle diverts a goal-directed system from its course, that system Eeems to try to remoye the interference, go around it, or turn it to some ad.vantage. What kind of process inside a machine could give the impression of having a goal-of purpose, persistence, and directedness? There is indeed a certain particular type of machine that appears to have those qualities; it is built according to the principles below, which were first studied in the late I950s by Allen Newell, C. f . Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon. Originally, these systems were called general problem solvers, but I'll simply call them difference-engines. A difference-engine must contain a description of a \"desired\" situation. It must have subagents that are aroused by various differences between the desired situation and the actual situation. Each subagent must act in a way that tends to diminish the difference that aroused it. ACTUAL INPUTS IDEAL INPUTS At first, this may seem both too simple and too complicated. Psychologically, a difference- engine might appear to be too primitive to represent the complex of ambitions, frustrations, satisfactions, and disappointments involved in the pursuit of a human goal. But these aren't really aspects of our goals themselves but emerge from the interactions among the many agencies that become engaged in pursuit of those goals. On the other side, one might wonder whether the notion of a goal really needs to engage such a complicated four-way relationship among agents, situations, descriptions, and differences. Presently we'll see that this is actually simpler than it seems, because most agents are already concerned with differences. 78 P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\n7.9 INTENTIONS When we watch a ball roll down a slope, we notice it seems to try to get around obstacles that lie in its path. If we didn't know about gravity, we might be tempted to think that the ball has the goal of moving down. But we know that the ball isn't \"trying\" to do anything; the impression of intention is only in the watcher's mind. When we experiment with Builder we also get the sense that it has a goal. Whenever you take its blocks away, it reaches out and takes them back. Whenever you knock its tower down, it rebuilds it. [t seems to want a tower there, and it perseveres until the tower is done. Certainly Builder seems smarter than the rolling ball because it overcomes more complicated obstacles. But once we know how Builder works, we see that it's not so different from that ball: all it does is keep on finding blocks and putting them on top of other blocks. Does Builder really have a goal? One ingredient of having a goal is persistence. We wouldn't say that Builder wants a tower, if it didn't keep persisting in attempts to build one. But persistence alone is not enough-and neither Builder nor that rolling ball have any sense of. where they want to go. The other critical ingredient of goal is to have some image or description of a wanted or desired state. Before we'd agree that Builder wants a tower, we'd have to make sure that it contains something like an image or a description of a tower. The idea of a difference-engine embodies both elements: a representation of some outcome and a mechanism to make it persist until that outcome is achieved. Do difference-engines \"really\" want? It is futile to ask that kind of question because it seeks a distinction where none exists-except in some observer's mind. We can think of a ball as a perfectly passive object that merely reacts to external forces. But the eighteenth-century physi- cist fean Le Rond d'Alembert showed that one can also perfectly predict the behavior of a rolling ball by describing it as a difference-engine whose goal is to reduce its own energy. We need not force ourselves to decide questions like whether machines can have goals or not. Words should be our servants, not our masters. The notion of goal makes it easy to describe certain aspects of what people and machines can do; it offers us the opportunity to use simple descriptions in terms of active purposes instead of using unmanageably cumbersome descrip- tions of machinery. To be sure, this doesn't capture everything that people mean by \"having goals. \" We humans have so many ways of wanting things that no one scheme can embrace them all. Nevertheless, this idea has already led to many important developments both in Artificial Intelligence and in psychology. The difference-engine scheme remains the most useful conception of goal, pur- pose, or intention yet discovered. P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S 79\n7.IO GENIUS We naturally admire our Einsteins, Shakespeares, and Beethovens-and we wonder if ma- chines could ever create such wondrous theories, plays, and symphonies. Most people think that accomplishments like these require \"talents\" or \"gifts\" that cannot be explained. If so, then it follows that computers can't create such things-since anything machines do can be ex- plained. But why assume that what our greatest artists do is very different from what ordinary people do-when we know so little about what ordinary people dol Surely it is premature to ask how great composers write great symphonies before we know how ordinary people think of ordinary tunes. I don't believe there is much difference between normal and \"creative\" thought. Right now, if asked which seems the more mysterious, I'd have to say the ordinary kind. We shouldn't let our envy of distinguished masters of the arts distract us from the wonder of how each of us gets new ideas. Perhaps we hold on to our superstitions about creativity in order to make our own deficiencies seem more excusable. For when we tell ourselves that masterful abilities are simply unexplainable, we're also comforting ourselves by saying that those super- heroes come endowed with all the qualities we don't possess. Our failures are therefore no fault of our own, nor are those heroes' virtues to their credit, either. lf it isn't learned, it isn't earned. When we actually meet the heroes whom our culture views as great, we don't find any singular propensities-only combinations of ingredients quite common in themselves. Most of these heroes are intensely motivated, but so are many other people. They're usually very proficient in some field-but in itself we simply call this craftsmanship or expertise. They often have enough self-confidence to stand up to the scorn of peers-but in itself, we might just call that stubbornness. They surely think of things in some novel ways, but so does everyone from time to time. And as for what we call \"intelligence,\" my view is that each person who can speak coherently already has the better part of what our heroes have. Then what makes genius dppedr to stand apart, if we each have most of what it takes? I suspect that genius needs one thing more: in order to accumulate outstanding qualities, one needs unusually effective ways to learn. It's not enough to learn a lot; one also has to mdnage what one learns. Those masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery, some special knacks of \"higher-order\" expertise, which help them organize and apply the things they learn. It is those hidden tricks of mental management that produce the systems that create those works of genius. Why do certain people learn so many more and better skills? These all- important differences could begin with early accidents. One child works out clever ways to arrange some blocks in rows and stacks; a second child plays at rearranging how it thinks. Everyone can praise the first child's castles and towers, but no one can see what the second child has done, and one may even get the false impression of a lack of industry. But if the second child persists in seeking better ways to learn, this can lead to silent growth in which some better ways to learn may lead to better ways to learn to learn. Then, later, we'll observe an awesome, qualitative change, with no apparent cause-and give to it some empty name like talent, aptitude, or gift. Finally, an awful thought: perhaps what we call genius is rare because our evolution works without respect for individuals. Could any tribe or culture endure in which each individual discovered novel ways to think? If not, how sad, since the genes for genius might then lead not to nurturing, but only to frequent weeding-out. P R O B L E M S A N D G O A L S\nCHAPTER 8 A THEORY OF MEMORY I compared these yarious happy impressions with one another and found that they had this in common, ndmely, that I felt them as though they were occurring simultaneously in the present moment and in some distant past, which the sound of the spoon against the plate, or the uneyenness ofthe flagstones, or the peculiar flavor of the madeleine eyen went so far as to make coincide with the present,leaving me uncertain in which period I was. In truth, the person within me who was at this moment enioying this impression enioyed in it the qualities which it possessed that were common to both an earlier day and the present moment; and this person came into play only when, by this process of identifying past with present, he could find himself in the only environment in which he could live, that is to say, entirely outside of time. -MencE,r Pnousr\nE.l K- IJNES: A THEORY OF MEMORY We often talk of memory as though the things we know were stored away in boxes of the mind, like obiects we keep in closets in our homes. But this raises many questions. How is knowledge represented? How is it stored? How is it retrieved? Then, how is it used? Whenever we try to answer any of these, others seem to get more complicated, because we can't distinguish clearly what we know from how it's used. The next few sections explain a theory of memory that tries to answer all these questions at once by suggesting that we keep each thing we learn close to the agents that learn it in the first place. That way, our knowledge becomes easy to reach and easy to use. The theory is based on the idea of a type of agent called a \"Knowledge-line,\" or \"K-line\" for short. Wheneyer you \"get a good ided,\" solve a problem, or haye a memorable experience, you activate a K-line to \"represent\" it. A K-line is a wirelike structure that attaches itself to whichever mental agents are active when you solve a problem or have a good idea. When you activate that K-line later, the agents attached to it are aroused, putting you into a \"mental state\" much like the one you were in when you solved that prablem or got that idea. This should make it relatitely eosy for you to solre new, similar problems! In other words, we \"memorize\" what we're thinking about by making a list of the agents involved in that activity. Making a K-line is like making a list of the people who came to a successful party. Here is another image of how Klines work, suggested by Kenneth Haase, a student at the MIT Artificial Intellisence Laboratorv who had a ereat deal of influence on this theory. \"You wdnt to repair a bicycle. Before you start, smear your hands with red paint. Then ettery tool you need to use will end up with red marks on it. When you're done, iust remember that red means'good for fixing bicycles.' Next time you fix a bicycle, you can saye time by taking out all the red-marked tools in advance. \"lf you use different colors for different iobs, some tools will end up marked with several colors. That is, each agent can become attached to many different K-lines. Later, when there's a job to do, iust actiyate the proper K-line for that kind of iob, and all the tools used in the past for similar iobs will automatically become avail- able.\" This is the basic idea of the KJine theory. But suppose you had tried to use a certain wrench, and it didn't fit. It wouldn't be so good to paint that tool red. To make our Klines work efficiently, we'd need more clever policies. Still, the basic idea is simple: for each familiar kind of mental job, your K-lines can refill your mind with fragments of ideas you've used before on similar jobs. In such a moment, you become in those respects more like an earlier version of yourself. A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\n8.2 RE.MEMBERING Suppose once, long ago, you solved a certain problem P. Some of your agents were active then; others were quiet. Now let's suppose that a certain \"learning process\" caused the agents that were active then to become attached to a certain agent kP, which we'll call a KJine. If you ever activate kP afterward, it will turn on just the agents that were active then, when you first solved that problem P! ::i:::::::l ,;\\,4:i:i:i:::' ,,.. @ .:r. ,tr \\U i:i:.. @ :iiiii {iiir @ ,:i::iiiiii :ii,:,ili @ @:,iiiiiii,' .-r.,:,.:.n. @ ,:iilr:: ,',,,,,1\\t',*'\\ .);)r+::::: #',, ,:liii ::lii\". @- Today you have Something in your a different problem. mind suspects that Q Your mind is in a new state, with is similar to P-and activates kP. agents Q aroused. Now two sets of agents are active in your mind at once: the Q-agents of your recent thoughts and the P-agents aroused by that old memory. If everything goes well, perhaps both sets of agents will work together to solve today's problem. And that's our simplest concept of what memories are and how they're formed. What happens if the now active agents get into conflicts with those the K-line tries to activate? One policy might be to give priority to the Kline's agents. But we wouldn't want our memories to rearouse old states of mind so strongly that they overwhelm our present thoughts-for then we might lose track of what we're thinking now and wipe out all the work we've done. We only want some hints, suggestions, and ideas. Another policy would give the presently active agents priority over the remembered ones, and yet another policy would suppress both, according to the principle of noncompromise. This diagram shows what happens for each of these policies if we assume that neighboring agents tend to get into conflicts: p o p ' o P Po o P o o P O ' o P po P P e Q O P o o P o9 oo P n Q o P p P P o \": o o P o o O P o Non-compromlse. OId agents wln. New agenB wln. The ideal scheme would activate exactly those P's that would be most helpful present problem. But that would be too much to ask of any simple strategy. A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y the\n8.3 MENTAT STATES AND DISPOSMONS Many modern scientists think it quaint to talk about \"mental states.\" They feel this idea is too \"subiective\" to be scientific, and they prefer to base their theories of psychology on ideas about information processing. This has produced many good theories abouiproUf.r solving, patt-ern recognition, and other important facets of psychology, but on the whole it hasn't led to useful ways to describe the workings of our dispositions, attitudes, and feelings. Is this because, as many think, our feelings ire inherently more complicatld than the things we more easily describe in words? Npt necessarily: our memories of attitudes and feelings \"orrid come from relatively simple Kline mechanisms-yet still be inexpressible. This is because K- lines can easily recoid relatively widespread and diifuse activities and, later, reactivate thern all at once. This helps explain a familiar psychological phenomenon: The experiences we find easiest to recollect are often just the kinds we find the hardest to describe. For example, a novice can remember how it felt to be at a concert. A more proficient amateur can remember more of the music itself-the rhythms and the harmonies and melodies. But only skilled musicians can recall the smaller details of timbre, texture, and arrangement. Why do we find it easier to recollect our attitudes and feelings than to describe what\"actually tool place? That's iust what we should expect from memories of the Kline kind. Suppor\" ihrt \" certain sentiment or disposition involved the activities of many different agents. It would be easy to construct a huge KJine with which we could, later, make ourselves approximately reexperience that complicated state-simply by rearousing the same activities. But this would not automatically enable ts to describe those feelings, which is another matter entirelv, because it would require us to summarize that huge, dispersed activity in terms of some much more compact arrangement of verbal expressions. - We cannot always iudge the complexity of our mental states by how easily we can express them in words. A certain state of mind might involve a mass of information simply too enor- mous and diverse to express in any small number of words, yet not be very complicated in any interesting sense. Furthermore, the things we cdn express in words are, to \" l\"rg. extent, constrained by the social process through which we learn to use those words. In oider for a word 16 have a predictable effect on other persons, we must maintain strict, public discipline on how that word is used-whereas each individual's private, internal signali need not be so constrained. The signals that come from our nonverbal agents can have K-line connections that branch out very rapidly to arouse other agents. If each member of such a society were to arouse a mere hundred others, then in only three or four steps the activity of a single one of them could affect a million other agents. Once we think in terms of Kline memories, it becomes easy to imagine, at least in principle, how a person could recall a general impression of a complex previous experiencl-but it becomes hard to understand how a person can so easily comprehend a specific statement llke \"lohn has more candy than Mary.\" If this theory is correct, the traditional view must be upside down,. which regards it as easy to understand how minds can deal with \"facts\" and \"pro osi- tions,\" but hard to see how minds could have diffuse, hard-to-express dispositions. A T I I E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\n8.4 PARTIAT MENTAI STATES We make our new ideas by merging parts of older ones-and that means keeping more than one idea in mind at once. Let's oversimplify matters for the moment and imagine that the mind is composed of many \"divisions,\" each involved with a different activity, like vision, locomotion, langtige, and so forth. This pattern repeats on smaller scales, so that even the thought of the simplest ordinary object is made up of smaller thoughts in smaller agencies. Thinking about a small white rubber ball could activate some divisions like these: SHAPE SUBSTANCE RUBBER COLOR SIZE ..:lii:,. .:i:,i: * **'t '''iu' 1,, riiii'@ iiiii 'r,,r,, G)iiii1.,1,1ii i1i1i @ r$,ii@ FIST SOME DIVISIONS OFA MIND-SOCIETY We'll need some way to talk about the states of many agencies at once. So, in this book, I'll use the expression \"mental state\" or \"total mental state\" when talking about the states of all of one's agents. The new phrase \"partial mental state\" is for talking about the states of smaller groups of agents. Now in order to be clear, we'll have to simplify our picture of the situation, the way scientists do. We shall assume that each agent in our society, at each moment, is eithet in a \"quiet stote\" or an \"dctiye stdte.\" Why can't an agent be partially aroused, instead of only \"on\" or \"off\"? They could indeed, but there are technical reasons why this would not make any fundamental difference to the issues we are discussing here. In any case, this assumption allows us to be precise: A\"total state\" of mind is a list that specifies which agents are active and which are quiet at a certain moment. A \"partial stdte\" of mind merely specifies that certain agents are active but does not say which other agents are quiet. Notice that according to this definition, a mind can have exactly one total state at any moment, br-rt it can be in many partial states at the same time-because partial states are incomplete descriptions. The picture above shows a mind-society made up of several separate divisions, so we can think of each division's state as one partial state, and this lets us imagine that the entire system can \"think several thoughts at once,\" just as a crowd of separate people can. When your speech division is being occupied with what your friend is saying while your vision division looks for a door to exit through-then your mind is in two partial states at once. The situation is more interesting when two Klines activate agents in the same division at the same time: imposing two different partial mental states on the same agency can lead to conflicts. lt is easy to think of a small white bdll because this activates Klines that connect to unrelated sets of agents. But when you try to imagine a round sgudre, your agents f.or round and square are forced to compete to control the same set of shape-describing agents. If the conflict is not settled soon, noncompromise may eliminate both-and leave you with the sense of an unde- fined shape. A T T I E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\nE.5 TEVET.BANDS kite n. a toy consisting of a light frame, usually of wood, with paper or other light material stretched upon it; mostly in the form of an isosceles triangle with a circular arc as base, or a quadrilateral symmetrical about the longer diagonal; constructed (usually with a tail of some kind for the purpose of balancing it) to be flown in a strong wind by medns of a long string attached. -Oxford English D ictionary \"lack is flying his kite.\" What knowledge do you need to understand this? It helps to know that you can't fly kites without any wind. It helps to know how to fly a kite. You would understand it better if you knew how kites are made, or where they're found, or what they cost. Understanding never ends. It is remarkable how much we can imagine about fack's activity. Neither you nor I have ever seen |ack's kite, nor do we know its color, shape, or size, and yet our minds supply details from memories of other kites we've seen before. That sentence may have made you think of string, yet string wasn't mentioned. How does your mind arouse so many memories so quickly? And how does your mind know not to arouse too many memories -something that could also lead to serious problems? To explain this, I'll introduce what I call the level-band theory. The basic idea is simple: we learn by attaching agents to K-lines, but we don't attach them all with equal firmness. Instead, we make strong connections at a certain level of detail, but we make weaker connections at higher and lower levels. A Kline for a kite mieht include some properties like these: TOO HIGH HIGH.LEVEL GENERALITIES AND FUNCTIONS OBJECT TOY,GIFT REOANDWHITE SPECIF'C LOW.LEVEL DEIAILS AND STRUCTUNES Whenever we turn on this K-line, it tries to activate all these agents, but those near the fringes are attached as though by twice used tape and tend to retreat when other agents challenge them. If most of the kites you've seen before were red and diamond-shaped, then when you hear about Jack's kite, those weak connections will lead you to assume that Jack's kite, too, is red and diamond-shaped. But if you should hear that fack's kite is green, your weakly activated red-color agent memories will be suppressed by your strongly activated green- color agents. Let's call these kinds of weakly activated memories assumptions by defauh. De- fault assumptions, once aroused, stay active only when there are no conflicts. In psychological terms, they are things we assume when we have no particular reason to think otherwise. Later we'll see that default assumptions embody some of our most valuable kinds of commonsense knowledge: knowing what is usual or typical. For example, they're why we all assume that fack has hands and feet. If such assumptions turn out to be wrong, their weak connections allow them to be easily displaced when better information comes to mind. 86 A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\n8.6 tEVEtS We sometimes think of memory as though it could transport us back to hear the voices of times gone by and see the sights of the past. But memory can't really take us anywhere; it can only recall our minds to prior states, to visit whal we used to be, by putting back what was in the mind before. We introduced the level-band theory to provide a way for a memory to encompass some range or \"level\" of detail of descriptions, as when, in remembering that kite experience, certain aspects were recorded firmly and others weakly or not at all. The concept of a level-band can be applied not only to descriptions of things, but also to our memories of the processes and activities we use in order to achieve our goals-that is, the mental states we re-create that once solved problems in the past. The problems we have to solve change with time, so we must adapt our old memories to our present goals. To see how level- bands can help with that, let's now return to Play-with-Blocks-but this time let's suppose that our child has grown to maturity and wants to build a real house. Which agents from the old building-society can still be applied to this new problem? PLAY.WITH.ELOCKS IEYEI ]'IOO,rlHlctl LEVIEI:::ioo!'lit'tt Old top-level &rrsalre inap$qiate. &''dldedilsol dd stategies uetoo spxiftc. The new house-building agency can certainly use many of Tower Builder's skills. It certainly will need Add's lower-level skills like Find and Get and Puf. But HouseBuilder won't have so much use for Tower Builder's highest-level agents like Begin and End-because these were specialized for making towers. Nor will it have much use for Buildeis lowest-level skills, like those in Crasp, because picking up such small blocks isn't the problem. But most of the skills embodied in Builder's middle level-bands will still apply. These seem to embody the sort of knowledge that is most broadly and generally useful, whereas uppermost and lowest level-bands are more likely to be based on aspects of the problem that are specific to an older goal or to the particular details of the original problem. But if our memory machinery has been designed so that the contents of those distant fringes can be easily detached, the extra knowledge stored in them will rarely do much harm and can often be helpful. For example, Tower Buildeis fringe details could tell us what to do in case our house should grow very tall or require a high chimney. We started out by using level-bands for describing things-but we ended up using them for doing things! In the next few sections we'll see that it is no accident that level-related ideas play many different roles in how we think. A T I I E O R Y O F M E M O R Y 87\n8.7 FRINGES It's hard to recognize a thing when you're presented with too much detail. To know that you are seeing a kite, it helps to look for paper, sticks, and string. But if you were to use a micro- scope, what you'd perceive would not be properties of kites at all, but merely features of particular bits of paper, sticks or string. These might allow you to identify a particular kite but not to recognize any other kite. Past a certain level of detail, the more one sees, the less one can tell what one is seeing! The same applies to memories; they should weaken their attach- ments at lower levels of detail. Lower Band: Beyond a certain level of detail, increasingly complete memories of previous situations are increasingly difficult to match to new situations. To explain why K-lines need an upperJevel fringe, let's return to that example in which our child originally learned how to build a tower-but now desires to build a house. Here, we could have another kind of difficulty if we remembered too much about our previous goals! Upper Band: Memories that arouse agents at too high a level would tend to provide us with goals that are not appropriate to the present situation. To see why our K-line memories should weaken their attachments aboye a certain level of detail, consider this most extreme form. Suppose some memory were so complete that it made you relive, in every detail, some perfect moment of your past. That would erase your present \"you\"-and you'd forget what you had asked your memory to do! Both fringing effects serve to make our memories more relevant to our present purposes. The central level-band helps us find general resemblances between remembered events and present circumstances. The lower fringe supplies additional details but does not force them upon us. We use them only \"by default\" when actual details are not supplied. Similarly, the upper fringe recalls to mind some memories of previous goals, but again, we're not forced to use them except by default, when present circumstances do not impose more compelling goals. Seen this way, we can think of the lower fringe as concerned with the structures of things, and we can think of the upper fringe as involved with the functions of things. The lower levels represent \"obiective\" details of reality; the upper levels represent our \"subjective\" concerns with goals and intentions. How could the fringes of the same K-line lie in two such different realms? Because in order to think, we need intimate connections between things and goals-between structures and their functions. What use would thinking be at all, unless we could relate each thing's details to our plans and intentions? Consider how often the English language employs the selfsame words for things and for their purposes. What tools would you use, when building your house, to saw and clamp and glue your wood? That's obvious: you'd use a saw and a clamp and some glue! Behold the wondrous force of those \"meanings\": no sooner do we hear the noun form of a word than our agents strain to perform the acts that correspond to it as a verb. This phenom- enon of connecting medns with ends is not confined to language-we'll see many other in- stances of it in other kinds of agencies-but language may allow such linking with the least constraint. 88 A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\nE.8 SOCIETIES OF MEMORIES Yesterday, you watched lack fly his kite. How do you remember that today? One answer would be, \"Remembering it is much like seeing it again.\" But yesterday, when you recognized that kite, you didn't really see it as something wholly new. The fact that you recognized it as a \"kite\" yesterday means that you already saw that kite in terms of even older memories. This suggests two ways to make new memories of what you saw a moment ago. One scheme is shown to the left below: you simply connect a new K-line to all the agents that were recently active in your mind. The other way to make that memory is shown in the diagram to the right below: instead of attaching the new K-line to that whole multitude of separate agents, connect it only to whicheyer of your older K-lines were active recently. This will lead to a similar result, since those K-lines were involved in arousing many of the agents that were active recently. This second scheme has two advantages: it is more economical, and it leads to forming memories as organized societies. K-ilne attached to many agents. K-line attached to threa K-llnes. Consider that when you realized Jack was flying a kite, this must have involved the use of K- lines-for \"fack\" and \"Fly\" and \"Kite\"-that had been formed at earlier times and were aroused by the sight of fack flying his kite. When those three K-lines were activated, each of them in turn activated hundreds or thousands of other agents. (Your state of mind, when seeing that scene, resulted from combinations both of agents aroused directly by your senses and of agents aroused indirectly by your recognitions.) Now, our left-hand memory-scheme would need an enormous number of connections to link all those agents to the new K-line. But our right-hand scheme would obtain much the same effect by attaching the new Kline to only three old K- lines! Yet when you reactivate that Kline at some later date, it will, in turn, arouse the same K- lines for fack, Fly, Kite, and whichever other recognitions were involved. As a result, you will reexperience many of the same recognitions as before. To that extent, you will feel and act as though you were back in the same situation again. To be sure, these two types of memories would not produce exactly the same results. Our trick of connecting new K-lines to old ones will not recapture so many of the scene's precise, perceptual details. Instead, the kinds of mental states that this \"hierarchical\" type of memory produces will be based more on stereotypes and default assumptions than on actual percep- tions. Specifically, you will tend to remember only what you recognized at the time. So some- thing is lost-but there's a gain in exchange. These \"K-line memory-trees\" lose certain kinds of details, but they retain more traces of the origins of our ideos. These memory-trees might not serve quite so well if the original circumstances were exactly repeated. But that never happens, anyway-and the structured memories will be much more easily adapted to new situations. A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\n8.9 KNOWTEDGE.TREES If each K-line can connect to other K-lines, which, in turn, connect to others, then Klines can form societies. But how can we make sure that this can serve our purposes, instead of becoming a great, disordered mess? What could guide them into representing useful hierarchies like these? ffiHm ffiffimffiffiffi Hftfiftftfrftfr* frRfrH*R frfrR frftRHHR RfrR To keep things orderly, we'll now apply that level-band idea again. Remember that we first invented Klines to link older agents together; then we invented level-bands to keep those K- lines from filling up with too much useless, unrelated stuff. Now we have the same problem again: when connecting new Klines to old ones, we must keep them from including too much inappropriate detail. So why not try the same solution? Let's apply the level-band idea to the K- line trees themselves! When making d nev K-line memory, do not connect it to oll the K-lines actiye at the time but only to those that are actiye within a certain level-band. It might be supposed that this idea would be hard to apply unless we specify what \"level\" means. However, something like this will happen automatically, simply because the new Kline societies will tend to inherit whatever hierarchy already existed among the original agents that become connected to those Klines. We've actually seen two different ideas about this. In our Kite example, we talked about a description's \"level of detail.\" That is, we regarded it as more elevated to talk about \"a sheet stretched dcross a frame\" than to discuss the paper or the sticks themselves. In our Builder example, we talked about goals and considered the Tower Builder agent itself to be a level above the agents it exploits to solve its subproblems-agents like Begin and Add andBnd. This policy of connecting new K-lines to old ones must be used in moderation. Otherwise, no new agents would eyer be included in our memories. Furthermore, it should not always be required to produce simple, orderly hierarchy-trees; for example, in the case of Builder, we found that both Move and Sea will often need one another's help, Eventually, all of our knowledge-structures become entangled with various sorts of exceptions, shortcuts, and cross- connections. No matter: the level-band idea will still apply in general, since most of what we know will still be mainly hierarchical because of how our knowledge grows. FLY 90 A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\n8.IO tE\\TEtS AND CI.ASSIFICATIONS Isn't it interesting how often we find ourselves using the idea of level? We talk about a person's levels of aspiration or accomplishment. We talk about levels of abstraction, levels of manage- ment, levels of detail. Is there anything in common to all the level-things people talk about? Yes: they each appear to reflect some way to organize ideas-and each seems vaguely hierar- chical. Usually, we tend to think that each of those hierarchies illustrates some kind of order that exists in the world. But frequently those orderings come from the mind and merely dppedr to belong to the world. Indeed, if our theory of Kline trees is correct, it would seem \"natural\" for us to classify things into levels and hierarchies-even when this does not work out perfectly. The diagram below portrays two ways to classify physical obiects. ,- l\\. ,- l-..

These two hierarchies split things up in different ways. The birds and airplanes are close together on one side, but far apart on the other side. Which classification is correct? Silly question! [t depends on what you want to use it for. The one on the left is more useful for biologists, and the one on the right is more useful for hunters. How would you classifu a porcelain duck, a pretty decorative toy? Is it a kind of bird? Is it an animal? Or is it just a lifeless piece of clay? It makes no sense to argue about it: \"That's not a bird!\" \"Oh, yes, it is, and it is also pottery.\" Instead, we frequently use two or more classifica- tions at the same time. For example, a thoughtful child can play with a porcelain duck as though it were a make-believe animal, yet at the same time treat it carefully, as is appropriate when handling a delicate china object. Whenever we develop a new skill or extend an old one, we have to emphasize the relative importance of some aspects and features over others. We can place these into neat levels only when we discover systematic ways to do so. Then our classifications can resemble level-schemes and hierarchies. But the hierarchies always end up getting tangled and disorderly because there are also exceptions and interactions to each classification scheme. When attempting a new task, we never like to start anew: we try to use what has worked previously. So we search around inside our minds for old ideas to use. Then, when part of any hierarchy seems to work, we drag the rest along with it. A T H E O R Y O F M E M O R Y\n8.I I LAYERS OF SOCIETIES According to our concept of memory, the Klines of each agency grow into a new society. So, to keep things straight, let's call the original agents S-ageits and call their society the S- society. Given any S-society, we can imagine building -.-ori.s for it by constructing a corre- sponding K-society for it. When we start making aK-society, we must link each K-hn! directly to S-agents, because there are no other K-lines we can connect them to. Later we can use the more-efficient policy of linking new K-lines to old ones. But this will lead to a different problem of efficiency: the connections to the original S-agents will become increasingly remote and indirect. Then everything will begin to slow down-unless the K-society contiiues to make at least some new connections to the original S-society. That would be easy to arrange, if the K-society grows in the form of a\"layer\" close to its S-society. The diagram below suggists such an arrangement. The connectlons ln the K-soclety are slm,tar to those In tne S-soclety, except that the stgnals tenct to flow In oppostte dlrectlons. If arranged this way, the layer pairs could form a curious sort of computer. As S-agents excite K-agents and vice versd, a sort of spiraling activity would ensue. Over time, the location of that activity might tend to drift upward or down and might also tend to spread out; without some control, the system might soon become chaotic. But it would be hard to control the system from within, nor would that serve the purposes of other agencies. However, we can easily imagine how yet another, third agency could confine and control the K-S system's activity-by specifying which level-band should remain active and suppressing all the iest. lndeed, itt\"t it precisely the sort of coarse control that a B-brain might exercise, since it could do all this without needing to understand the fine details of what is happening inside the A-brain. The third agency might simply look on and say impatiently, \"This isn't getting anywhere: moye up to take a higher-level view of the situation.\" Or it might say, \"That looks like progress, so moye farther down and fill in more details.\" Is there any essential difference between the K- and S-societies? Not really-except that the S-society came first. Indeed, we can imagine an endless sequence of such societies, in which each new one learns to exploit the last. Later we'll propose that this is how our minds develop in infancy-as sequences of layers of societies. Each new layer begins as a set of K-lines, which starts by learning to exploit whatever skills have been acquired by the previous layer. Whenever a layer acquires some useful and substantial skill, it tends to stop learning and changing-and then yet another new layer can begin to learn to exploit the capabilities of the last. Eaih new Iayer begins as a student, learning new ways to use what older layers can already do. Then it slows its learning rate-and starts to serve both as subject and as teacher to the layers that form afterward. A T H E O N Y O F M E M O R Y\nCHAPTER 9 SUMMARIES Apart from pain, whose function is obviously that of informing the higher centers of the nervous system where there is something out of order, there dre mdny physiological mechanisms which are there for the sole reason of letting us know that something is wrong. We feel ill without knowing the redson. The wry fact that we haye only one term, \"l feel ill,\" for d rdnge of conditions based on differcnt causes is extremely characteristic. -KoNnRo LonnNz\n9.I WANTING AND IJKING One thing I hate is being asked questions like these: Do you prefer physics to biology? Did you like that play? Do you likeWagner? Did you enioy your year abraod? What makes us want to compress so much into such inexpressive summaries as \"like,\" \"prefer,\" and \"enjoy\"? Why try to reduce such complex things to simple values or amounts of pleasurable quality? The answer is that our measures of pleasure have many uses. They help us make comparisons, compromises, and choices. They are involved with the communication signs that we use to signify various degrees of attachment, satisfaction, and agreement. They show themselves not only in words, but also as gestures, intonations, smiles and frowns, and many other expressive signs. But we have to be careful not to accept those signs at their face value. Neither the state of the world nor that of the mind is ever so simple that it can be expressed in a single, one-dimensional judgment. No situation is ever completely satisfactory or entirely disagreeable, and our reactions of pleasure or disgust are only superficial summaries of pyramids of underlying processes. To \"enjoy\" an experience, some of our agents must summarize success-but other agents must be censuring their subordinates for failing to achieve their goals. So we ought to be suspicious when we find ourselves liking something very much, because that might mean some of our agencies are forcefully suppressing other possibil- ities. The surer you dre that you like what you drc doing, the morc completely your other ambitions are being suppfessed. To choose between alternatives, the highest levels of the mind demand the simplest summar- ies. If your top-level feelings were too often \"mixed,\" you would rarely be able to make a choice to decide which foods to eat, which paths to walk, or which thoughts to think. At the level of action, you're forced to simplify right down to expressions like \"Yes\" and \"No.\" But these are not informative enough to serve the lower levels of the mind, where many processes go on at once, and every agent has to judge how well it is serving some local goals. At lower levels of the mind, there must be hosts of smaller, coexisting satisfactions and annoyances. We often talk as though we ought to be controlled by what we want. lndeed we scarcely distinguish between wanting something and potentially obtaining pleasure from it; the relation between these two ideas seems so intimate that it actually feels odd to mention it. It seems so natural to want what we like and to avoid what we don't like that we sometimes feel a sense of unnatural horror when another person appears to violate that rule; then we think, They surely wouldn't do such things unless, deep down, they really wanted fo. It is as though we feel that people ought to want only to do the things they like to do. But the relation between wanting and liking is not simple at all, because our preferences are the end products of so many negotiations among our agencies. To accomplish any substantial goal, we must renounce the other possibilities and engage machinery to keep ourselves from succumbing to nostalgia or remorse. Then we use words like \"liking\" to express the operation of the mechanisms that hold us to our choice. Liking's job is shutting off alternatives; we ought to understand its role since, unconstrained, it narrows down our universe. This leads to liking's artificial clarity: it does not reflect what liking is but only shows what liking does. S U M M A R I E S\n9.2 GERRYMAIiIDERING We all know how accomplishment can bring satisfaction, and we tend to assume a direct connection between them. In very simple animals, where \"satisfaction\" means no more than meeting simple, basic needs, satisfaction and accomplishment must indeed be virtually the same. But in a complex human brain, a great many layers of agencies are interposed between the ones that deal with body needs and those that represent or recognize our intellectual accomplishments. Then what is the significance, in these more complicated systems, of those pleasant feelings of accomplishment and disagreeable sensations of defeat? They must be in- volved with how our higher-level agencies make summaries. Suppose that you once had to send a present to a friend. You had to choose a gift and find a box in which to wrap it. Soon, each such job turned into several smaller ones-like finding strings and tying them. The only way to solve hard problems is by breaking them into smaller ones and then, when those are too difficult, dividing them in turn. So hard problems always lead to branching trees of subgoals and subproblems. To decide where resources should be applied, our problem-solving agents need simple summaries of how things are going. Let's suppose each agent's summary is based on other summaries it gets from the agents it supervises. Here is a pathological example of what could happen if every such summary were based on a simple majority decision: All ln dl, lA t.y thtt was fun. No, maybc onty tugtht. Thatb lect than halfi - ln facl lt wa: only 8/27ths. That's lott than onc.thirdl When all is done, if someone asked if you enjoyed the whole experience, you might say that it was \"fun\" or \"terrible. \" But no such summ ary can say very much of what your agencies actually learned. Your knot-tying processes learned which actions worked and failed; your paper-folding and gift-selecting processes had other failures and accomplishments; but your overall assessment of the experience cannot reflect all those details. If the entire episode left you \"unhappy,\" you might be less inclined to give presents in the future, but that should not have much effect on what you learned about folding paper and tying string. No single sense of \"good\" or \"bad\" can reflect much of what went on inside all your agencies; too much informa- tion must be concealed. Then why does it seem so satisfactory for us to classify our feelings into positive and negative and conclude that \"on the whole\" the net effect was bad or good? True, sometimes feelings are more mixed and everything seems bittersweet, but, as we'll see, there are many reasons why we have to oversimplify. S U M M A R I E S\n9.3 I.EARNING FROI\\fi FAITT'RE So far, we've talked mostly of learning from success. But consider that when you succeed, you must already have had the necessary means within your grasp. If so, then making changes in your mind might only make things worse! As people often say, \"You shouldn't argue with success.\" For whenever you try to \"improve\" an already working procedure, you risk damaging whichever other skills depend on that same machinery. Accordingly, it may be more important that we learn from how we fail. What should you do if some well-established method-call it \"M\"-has failed to reach a certain goal? One policy would be to alter M, so it won't make the same mistake again. But even that might be dangerous because it might cause M to fail in other ways. Besides, we might not know how to change M to remove the error. A safer way to deal with this would be to modify M by adding special memory devices called \"censors\" and \"suppressors\" (we'll discuss this in detail later), which remember particular circumstances in which M fails and later proceed to suppress M when similar conditioni recur. Such censors would not tell you what to do, only what you shouldn't do; still, they prevent your wasting time try repeating old mistakes. Learning has at least two sides. Some parts of our minds learn from success-by remember- ing when methods work. But other portions of our minds learn mainly when we make mistakes, by remembering the circumstances in which various methods failed to work. Later we'll see how this can teach not only what we shouldn't do, but also what we shouldn't thinkt When that happens, it can permeate our minds with prohibitions and taboos of which we're entirely unaware. Thus, learning from success tends to aim and focus how we think, while learning from failure also leads to more productive thoughts, but in a less directed way. We would not need to deal with exceptions and censors if we lived in a universe of simple, general rules with no exceptions, as in the lovely mathematical worlds of arithmetic, geometry, and logic. But perfect logic rarely works in the real worlds of people, thoughts, and things. This is because it is no accident that there are no exceptions to the rules in those mathematical worlds: there, we start with the rules and imagine only obiects that obey them. But we can't so willfully make up the rules for objects that already exist, so our only course is to begin with imperfect guesses-collections of rough and ready rules-and then proceed to find out where they're wrong. Naturally, we tend to prefer learning from success rather than from failure. However, I suspect that confining ourselves to \"positive\" learning experiences alone leads to relatively small improvements in what we can already do. Probably, there is no way to avoid at least a certain degree of discomfort when we make substantial chanses in how we think. 96 S U M M A R I E S\n9.4 ENJOYING DISCOMFORT Do not become attached to the things you like, do not maintain ayersion to the things you dislike. Sorrow, fear and bondage come from one's likes and dislikes. - B u n p H e Why do children enjoy the rides in amusement parks, knowing that they will be scared, even sick? Why do explorers endure suffering and pain-knowing that their very purpose will dis- perse once they arrive? And what makes ordinary people work for years at jobs they hate, so that someday they will be able to-some seem to have forgotten what? There is more to motivation than immediate reward. When we succeed at anything, a lot goes on inside the mind. For example, we may be filled with feelings of accomplishment and pride, and feel impelled to show others what we've done and how. However, it is the fate of more ambitious intellects that the sweetness of success will swiftly fade as other problems come to mind. That's good because most problems do not stand alone but are only smaller parts of larger problems. Usually, after we solve a problem, our agencies return to some other, higher- level cause for discontent, only to lose themselves again in other subproblems. Nothing would get done if we succumbed to satisfaction. But what if a situation gets completely out of our control-and offers no conceivable escape from suffering? Then all we can do is try to construct some inner plan for tolerating it. One trick is to try to change our momentary goal-as when we say, \"It's getting there that's all the fun.\" Another way is looking forward to some benefit to future Self: \"I certainly shall learn from fhis.\" When that doesn't work, we can still resort to even more unselfish schemes: \"Perhaps others may learn from my mistake.\" These kinds of complications make it impossible to invent good definitions for ordinary words like \"pleasure\" and \"happiness.\" No small set of terms could suffice to express the many sorts of goals and wants that, in our minds, compete in different agencies and on different scales of time. It is no wonder that those popular theories about reward and punishment have never actually led to explaining higher forms of human learning-however well they've served for training animals. For in the early stages of acquiring any really new skill, a person must adopt at least a partly antipleasure attitude: \"Good, this is a chance to experience awkwardness and to discover new kinds of mistakesl\" It is the same for doing mathematics, climbing freezing moun- tain peaks, or playing pipe organs with one's feet: some parts of the mind find it horrible, while other parts enjoy forcing those first parts to work for them. We seem to have no names for processes like these, though they must be among our most important ways to grow. None of this is to say that we can discard the concepts of pleasure and liking as we use them in everyday life. But we have to understand their roles in our psychology; they represent the end effects of complex ways to simplify. S U M M A R I E S\nCHAPTER 1 0 PAPERT'S PRINCIPTE Inteniewer: Now, Adam,listen to what I say. Tell me which is better: \"d wdter\" ot \"some wdter\"? Adam: Pop go weasel. - R o c n n B n o w N R N o U R S U L A B E L L U G I , D I S C U S S I N G P R O B L E M S W I T H E X P E R I M E N T S O N Y O U N G C H I L D R E N .\nIO.I PI,AGET'S EXPERIMENTS The psychologist Jean Piaget was one of the first to realize that watching children might be a way to see how mind-societies grow. In one of his classic experiments, he showed a child two matching sets of eggs and cups-and asked, \"Are there more eggs or more egg cups?\" Most chlldren, young or old, saf, 'They're the same.\" Then he spread the eggs apart-before the child's eyes-and asked again if there were more eggs or more egg cups. Typlcal S-year-old: \"More eggs.\" Typlcal 7-year-old: \"The same, because they're the same eggs.\" One might try to explain this by supposing that older children are better at counting. How- ever, this can't explain another famous experiment of Piaget's, which began by showing three jars, two filled with water. All the children agreed that the two short, wide jars contained equal amounts of liquid. Then, before their eyes, he poured all the liquid from one of the short iars into the tall, thin one and asked which jar had more liquid now. Typlcal S-year-old: \"Mora ln the tall Jar.\" Typlcal 7-year-otd: \"The same, because It's the same water.\" These experiments have been repeated in many ways and in many countries-and always with the same results: each normal child eventually acquires an adult view of quantity-appar- ently without adult help! The age at which this happens may vary, but the process itself seims so universal that one cannot help suspecting that it reflects some fundamental aspect of the mind's development. In the next few sections we'll examine the idea of \"more\" and show that it conceals the workings of a large, complex Society-of-More-which takes many years to learn. P A P E R T ' S P R I N C I P L E\nIO.2 REASONING ABOUT AMOUNTS cofl.S€r.vr'tion n. the principle that [something] is a constant quantity, transformable in countless ways, but neyer increased or diminished. -W ebster's U nabridged Dictionary What do those egg and water jar experiments say about our growth from infancy? Let's consider several explanations. QUANTfTY: Perhaps the younger children simply don't yet understand the basic concept of quantity: that the amount of liquid remains the same. In the next few sections I'll argue that we do not learn one single, underlying \"concept of quantity.\" Instead, each person must construct a multileveled agency, which we'll cali the Society-of-More, that finds different ways to deal with quantities. EXTENT: The younger children seem unduly influenced by the larger extent of space taken up by the spread-out eggs and taller water column. That cannot be the whole story because most adults, too, judge that there's more water in the taller jar-if they merely see the final scene, without knowing from where the water was poured! Here are a few other theories about the younger child's judgment: REVERSIBILIW: The older children pay more attention to what they think re- mains the same-while younger ones dre more concemed with what has changed. CONFINEMENT: An older child knows that the amount of water stays the same. if none wds eyer added or remoyed or lost or spilled. LOGIC: Perhaps younger children have not yet learned to apqly the kinds of reasoning that one would need to understand the concept of quantity. Every one of these explanations has some truth in it, but none reach the heart of the issue. It is clear that the older children know more about such matters and can do more complex kinds of reasoning. But there is ample evidence that most younger children also possess enough of the required abilities. For example, we can describe the experimeni without actually doing it at all or we can perform it out of the child's sight, behind a cardboard screen. Then, when we explai.n what is happening, quite a few of the younger children will say, \"Of course they'll be the sdme. Then what is the difficulty? Evidently, the younger children possess the ideas they need but don't know when to apply theml One might say that they lack adequate knowledge about their knowledge, or that they have not acquired the checks and balances required to select or override their hordes of agents with different perceptions and priorities. It is not enough to be able to use many kinds of reasoning; one also must know which to use in different circumstances! Learning is more than the mere accumulation of skills. Whatever we learn, there is always more to learn-about how to use what was alreadv learned. r00 P A P E R T ' S P R I N C I P L E\nIO.3 PRIORITIES Let's try to explain the water jar experiment in terms of how a child's agencies deal with comparisons. Suppose the child begins with only three agents: Tall says, \"The taller, the more.\" There's more inside a taller thing. Tlrrn says, \"The thinner, the less.\" There's less inside a thinner thing. Confined says, \"The sdme, because nothing was added or remoyed.\" How do we know children have agents like these? We can be sure that younger children have agencies llkeTaII andThin because they all can make these judgments: ' Thi ic,', 6 h a, h ci :, n.6- r b e C ii :i sei t: I tli i.,:,;;.i a t i Ci' t t . : : . , . . . . , . , . : . : :,:,i,.r,:jl--[:\" : ; 'ffi\",\", \"Th i s \", oh A,\"h aC, lC. ss; ;,,, i, DF:cauSc' ' f t E .tth{ ni' E i ;l l f:1,,., ffi\".'i. ,,::,, ,flltN : ,:,, 'GONFINED #....., .\"*o'.,.'' s:.....;!ilEi..,.'.:., It is harder to know whether younger children have agents like Confined, but many of them can indeed explain that something remains the same when one pours a liquid back and forth. In any case, there is a conflict because the three agents give three different answers-more, /ess, and same! What could be done to settle this? The simplest theory is that the younger children have placed their agents in some \"order of priority. \" ,i:filElri. xtioREx lf TALL is aroused, let it decide. lf not, and THIN is on,letTHlN decide. ln any other case, let CONF1NEDdxide. Such a scheme can be extremely practical, since placing all the agents in order of priority makes it easy to know which to use. For example, we often compare things by their extents- by how far they reach in space. But why putTall ahead of Wide? People do indeed seem most sensitive to vertical extents. We do not know whether this is built from the start into our brains, but in any case, the bias is usually iustified because \"more height\" so frequently goes along with other sorts of largenesses. Who's \"bigger\"-you or your cousin? Stand back to backt Who's the strongest? Those adults looming way above! How to divide a liquid into equal portions? Match the levels! No other agent seems so good as Tall for making everyday comparisons. Still, no priority- scheme will always work. In the situation of the water jar experiment, Confined ought io .o*. first,-but the younger child's priorities lead to making the wrong judgment. One might wonder, incidentally, whether Tall and Short, or Wide and Thin, should be considered to Le differeni agents. Logically, just one of each pair would suffice. But I doubt that in the brain it would suffice to represent Short by the mere inactivity of Tatt. To adults these are \"opposites,\" but children do not work so logically. One child I knew insisted that knife was the oppbsite of fork, but that fork was the opposite of spoon. Water was the opposite of milk. As for ihe opposite of opposite, that child considered this to be too foolish to discuss. trl0.HE P A P E R T ' S P R I N C I P L E\nIO.4 PAPERT'S PRINCIPTE What should one do when different kinds of knowledge don't agree? It sometimes helps to place them in some order of priority, but as we've seen, that can still lead to mistakes. How can we make our system sensitive to different circumstances? The secret is to use the principle of noncompromise and look for help from other agencies! For help with comparing quantities, we'll need to add new \"administrative agents\" to our Society-of-More. MORE TALL THIN CONFINED MORE I ::::::.:.:.:.iiii:.:':,:::i:::.::iijij:f :::::i::.::::: TALL THIN CONFINED New lnner I-ayer \"MORE' \"LESS', \"SAME' ,,IICRF\" \"LESS\" \"SAME' Early Soclety Later Soclety The new Appearance administrator is designed to say \"more\" when the agentTall is active, to say \"less\" when the agent Thin is active, and to say nothing at all when something appears both taller and thinner. Then the other new administrator, History, makes the decision on the basis of whatConfined says. This explanation of the difference between the older and younger children was first proposed by Seymour Papert in the 1960s, when we first started to explore society of mind ideas. Most previous theories had tried to explain Piaget's experiments by suggesting that children develop different kinds of reasoning as time goes by. That certainly is true, but the importance of Papert's conception is in emphasizing not merely the ingredients of reasoning, but how they're organized: a mind cannot really grow very much merely by accumulating knowledge. It must also develop better ways to use what it already knows. That principle deserves a name. Papert's Principle: Some of the most crucial steps in mental growth are based not simply on acquiring new skills, but on acquiring new administrative ways to use what one already knows. Our two new middle-level managers illustrate this idea: Appearance and History form a new, intermediate layer that groups together certain sets of lower-level skills. The choice of agents for those groups is absolutely critical. The system will work quite well if we group TalI andThin together, so that Confined can take control when they conflict, But it would only make things worse if we were to group Tall and Confined together! Then what decides which groups to form? Papert's principle suggests that the processes which assemble agents into groups must somehow exploit relationships among the skills of those agents. For example, because Tall and Thin are more similar in character to one another than to Confined, it makes sense to group them more closely together in the administrative hierarchy. P A P E R T ' S P R I N C I P T E\nIO.5 THE SOCIETY.OF-MORE Think how many meanings \"more\" must have! We seem to use a different one for every sort of thing we know. More red. More loud. More swift. More old. More tall. More soft. More cruel. More alive. More glad. More wealthy. Each usage has a distinct sense, involving different agencies. How could all these ways to make comparisons get grouped into just one society? Here's a Society-of-More a child might use to deal with that egg cup problem. APPEARANCE HISTORY SPATIAL C O N F I N E D SS ADD This society has two main divisions. In its Appearance division, aSpatial subdivision considers both the increased extent occupied by the spread-out eggs and also their thinned-out appear- ance or reduced density. In the case of those spread-out eggs, these conflict-and the Spatial agency withdraws. Then, if the child can count, Numerical decides; otherwise the Hisfory division applies some agents that use memories of recent happenings. If some of the eggs were rolled away, Confined would say that their amount is no longer the same; if the eggs were merely moved around, Reversible would claim that their amount cannot have changed. To solve the water jar problem, the Society-of-More would need other kinds of lower-level agents: MO APPEARANCE HISTORY SPATIAL OUANTI. TATIVE REVER.

But those mountains of bureau- cracy are more than worth their cost.

Without a many layered management, we couldn't use the knowledee in our loi- level agencies; they'd all keep getting in one another's way. NUMER. ICAL REVER. SIBLE MORE P A P E R T ' S P N I N C I P L E\n10.6 ASOTIT PI.AGET'S EXPERIMENTS Although Piaget's experiments about conservation of quantity have been confirmed as thor- oughly as any in psychology, we can appreciate why many people are skeptical when they first hear of these discoveries. They contradict the traditional assumption that children are much like adults, except more ignorant. How strange it is that in all the centuries of history, these phenomena went unnoticed until Piaget-as though no one had ever watched a child carefully! But it has always been that way with science. Why did it take so long for our thinkers to discover such simple ideas as Isaac Newton's laws of motion or Darwin's idea of natural selection? Here are some frequent challenges. Parent: Couldn't it be that younger children use words in ways that do not mean the same things to adults? Perhaps they simply take \"Which is more?\" to medn \"Which is higher?\" or \"Which is longer?\" Careful experiments show that this can't be entirely a matter of words. We can offer the same choices, wordlessly, yet most younger children will still reach out for taller, thinner jars of orange juice or stretched-out rows of candy eggs. Critic: What happens when Appearance and History confl.ict? Won't that paralyze y our whole Society -of-More? It would indeed-unless More has yet other levels and alternatives. And adults have other kinds of explanations*like \"magic,\" \"evaporation,\" or \"theft.\" But indeed, stage magicians find that making things disappear does not entertain the youngest children; presumably they are too used to encountering the unexplainable. What happens when Mora cannot decide what to do? That depends upon the states of other agencies-including those involved in dealing with frustration, restlessness, and boredom. Psychologist: We've heard of recent eyidence that, despite what Piaget said, very young children do haye concepts of quantity; many of them cdn even count those eggs. Doesn't that refute some of Piaget's discoveries? Not necessarily. Consider that no one disputes the outcomes of those jar and cup experi- ments. What is the significance, then, of evidence that the young children do possess methods that could give correct answers-and yet they do not use those abilities? As far as I can see, such evidence would only further support the need for explanations like those of Papert and Piaget. Biologist: Your theory might explain how some children could acquire those con- cepts about quantities-but it doesn't explain why all children end up with such similar abilities! Could we be born with built-in genes that make brains do this automatically? This is a profound question. It is hard-but not impossible-to imagine how genes could directly influence the higher-level ideas and conceptions that we eventually learn. We'll discuss this in the appendix at the end of this book. r04 P A P E R T ' S P R I N C I P L E\nIO.7 THE CONCEPT OF CONCEPT In learning their Societies-of-More, children learn various skills for comparing different qualities and quantities, like number and extent. It is tempting to try to summarize all that by saying that the children are learning something; we could call it the concept of quantity. B:ut why do we feel we have to think of what we learn as things or concepts? Why must we \"thing- ify\" everything? What is a thing? No one doubts that a child's building-block is a thing. But is a child's love for its mother also a \"thing\"? We're imprisoned by our poverty of words because even though we have good ways to describe objects and actions, we lack methods for describing dispositions and processes. We can scarcely speak of what minds do except as though they were filled with things that one could see or touch; that's why we cling to terms like \"concepts\" and \"ideas.\" I don't mean to say that this is always bad, for \"thing-ifying\" is indeed a splendid mental instru- ment. But for our present purpose, it is disastrous to assume that our minds contain some single \"concept of quantity.\" At different times, a word like \"more\" can mean many different kinds of things. Think about each of these expressions. More colorful. More loud. More swift. More valuable, More complicated. We speak as though these were similar, yet each of them involves a different, hard-earned web of ways to think! The phrase \"more loud\" might seem at first to be merely a matter of magnitude. But consider how the sound of a distant gong seems louder than a whisper near the ear-no matter that its actual intensity is less. Your reaction to what you hear depends not only on its physical intensity, but also on what your agencies conclude about the character of its source. Thus you can usually tell whether a gong is loud but distant, rather than soft but close, by unconsciously making assumptions about the origin of that sound. And all those other kinds of \"more\" engage equally subtle sorts of expertise. Instead of assuming that our children come to crystallize a single \"concept of quantity,\" we must try to discover how our children accumulate and classify their many methods for compar- ing things. How do agents like TalI, Thin, Short, andWide get formed into subagencies? To an adult, it seems natural to associate both being taller and being wider with being larger. But what prevents the child from inventing senseless \"concepts\" such as \"being Creen and Tall and having recently been touched\"? No child has the time to generate and test all possible combina- tions to find which ones are sensible. Life is too short to do that many bad experiments! The secret is: always try to combine related agents first.Tall,Thin,Short, andWide are all closely related, because they are all concerned with making comparisons between spatial qualities. In fact, they probably involve agencies that are close to one another in the brain and share so many agents in common that they'll naturally seem similar. P A P E R T ' S P R I N C I P L E\nIO.8 EDUCATION AI{D DEVETOPMENT Parent: lf those younger children take so long to acquire concepts like consenation of quantity, cdn't we help speed up their growth by teaching such things earlier? Such lessons iust don't seem to work very well. Given enough explanation and encourage- ment, and enough drill and practice, we can make children appear to understand-yet even then they don't often apply what they've \"learned\" to reallife situations. Thus it seems that even when we lead them along these paths, they remain unable to use much of what we show to them until they develop inner signposts of their own. Here's my guess about what goes wrong. Presumably the child senses that the spaced-out eggs are \"more\" because they stretch across a longer span. Eventually, we want that sense of greater length to be canceled out by the sense that there's more empty space between the eggs. In the more mature Papert hierarchy, this would happen automatically-but for now, the child could learn this only as a special, isolated rule. Many other problems could also be solved by making special rules for them. But to \"simulate\" that multilayer society, complete with middle- level agents llke Appedrdnce and History, would involve so many special rules, and so many exceptions to them, that the younger child would be unable to manage so much complexity. The result is that educational programs allegedly designed \"according to Piaget\" often appear to succeed from one moment to the next, but the structures that result from this are so fragile and specialized that children can apply them only to contexts almost exactly like those in which they were learned. All this reminds me of a visit to my home from my friend Gilbert Voyat, who was then a student of Papert and Piaget and later became a distinguished child psychologist. On meeting our five-year-old twins, his eyes sparkled, and he quickly improvised some experiments in the kitchen. Gilbert engaged fulie first, planning to ask her about whether a potato would balance best on one, two, three, or four toothpicks. First, in order to assess her general development, he began by performing the water jar experiment. The conversation went like this: Gilbert: \"Is there more water in this iar or in that iar?\" |ulie: \"If looks like there's more in that one. But you should ask my brother, Henry. He has consemation already.\" Gilbert paled and fled. I always wondered what Henry would have said. In any case, this anecdote illustrates how a young child may possess many of the ingredients of perception, knowledge, and ability needed for this kind of judgment-yet still not have suitably organized those components. Parent: Why are all the agents in your societies so competitive? They're always attacking each other. Instead of making Tall and Thin cancel each other out, why can't they cooperate? The first part of this book has given this impression because we had to begin with relatively simple mechanisms. It is fairly easy to resolve conflicts by switching among alternatives. It is much harder to develop mechanisms that can use cooperation and compromise-because that requires more complex ways for agencies to interact. In later sections of this book we'll see how higher-level systems could make more reasonable negotiations and compromises. P A P E R T ' S P N I N C I P T E\nIO.9 I.,EARNING A HIERARCI{Y How could a brain continue functioning while changing and adding new agents and connec- tions? One way would be to keep each old system unchanged while building a new version in the form of a detour around or across it-but not permitting the new version to assume control until we're sure that it can also perform the older system's vital functions. Then we can cut some of the older connections. We could use this method to form our hierarchical Societv-of-More: EXTENT DENSITY ADD REiIOVE INITIAL REACTIONS LEARNED INITIAL LEARNED REACTIONS INITIAL -I REACTIONS MORE Now let's draw this in another form, between the older ones. as though there were no room to fit new agents in MORE As we accumulate more lowlevel agents and additional intermediate layers to manage them, this grows into the very multilevel hierarchy we've seen before.

No, it was not their colours; it was the poise and balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose? -|euns f ovcn\nI I.I SEEING RED What possible kind of brain-event could correspond to anything like the meaning of an ordinary word? When you say \"red,\" your vocal cords obey commands from \"pronouncing agents\" in your brain, which make your chest and larynx muscles move to produce that special sound. These agents must in turn receive commands from somewhere else, where other agents respond to signals from yet other places. All those \"places\" must comprise the parts of some society of mental agencies. It's easy to design a machine to tell when there is something red: start with sensors that respond to different hues of light, and connect the ones most sensitive to red to a central \"red- agent,\" making corrections for the color of the lighting of the scene. We could make this machine appear to \"speak\" by linking each color-agent to a device that pronounces the corre- sponding word. Then this machine could name the colors i[ \"5ss5\"-4nd even distinguish more hues than ordinary people can. But it would be a travesty to call this \"sight,\" since it's nothing but a catalog that lists a lot of colored dots. It would share no human notion of what colors come to mean to us, because without some sense of texture, form, and very much more, it would have few of the qualities of our human kinds of irnages and thoughts.

Of course no little diagram can capture more than a fragment of any real person's thoughts about the world. But this should not be taken to mean that no machine could ever have the range of sensibilities that people have. It merely means that we aren't simple machines; indeed, we should understand that in learning to comprehend the qualities of vast machines, we are still in the dark ages. And in any case, a diagram can only illustrate a principle: there cannot be any compact way to represent all the details of full-grown mind-society. To talk about such complex things, we can only resort to language tricks that make our listeners'minds explore the worlds inside themselves. SEEING T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E\nII.2 THE SIIAPE OF SPACE -The brain is imprisoned inside the skull, a silent, dark, and motionless place; how can it learn what it's like outside? The surface of the brain itself has not the slightesf r.rr. of touch; it has no skin with which to feel; it is only connected to skin. Nor can a briin see, for it has no eyes; it only is connected to eyes. The only paths from the world to the brain are bundles of nerues like those that come in from the eyes, ears, and skin. How do the signals that come through those nerves give rise to our sense of \"being in\" the outside world? The answer is that this sinse is a complicated illusion. We never actually make any direct contact with the outside world. In- stead, we work with models of the world that we build inside our brains. The next few sections try to sketch how that could come about. The surface of the skin contains countless little touch-sensing agents, and the retina of the eye includes a million tiny light detectors. Scientists know a good deal about how these sensors send signals to the brain. But we know much less about how those signals lead to sensations of touch and of sight. Try this simple experiment: Touch your ear. What did that feel like? It seems impossible to answer that because there's scarcely anything to say. Now try a different experiment: Touch your ear twice, in two different places, and also touch your nose. Which two touches feel most similar? That question seems much easier to answer: one might say that the two ear touches feel more similar. Evidently, there is scarcely anything that one can say about a \"single sensation\" by itself, but we can often say much more when we can make comparisons. Consider the analogy to how mathematics treats a \"perfect point.\" We shouldn't speak about its shape; it simply doesn't haye a shape! But since we're used to things as having shapes, we cdn't help thinking of points as round, Iike \"very tiny little dots.\" Similarly, we're not supposed to talk about the size of a point-since math- ematical points, by definition, have no size. Still, we can scarcely help but think, in any cdse, \"they're yery small.\" In fact, there's absolutely nothing to be said about a single point, except how it relates to other points. This is not because such things are too complicated to explain, but because they are too simple to explain. One cannot even speak about where a point is, by itself-since \"where\" has meaning only in relation to other points in space. But once we know some palrs of points, we can relate these to the lines that connect them, and then we can define new, different points where various pairs of lines may intersect. Repeating this can generate entire worlds of geometry. Once we understand the terrifying fact that points are nothing by them- selves but exist only in relation to other points, then we can ask, ai Einstein did, whether time and space are anything more than vast societies of nearnesses. In the same way, there is little that one could say about any \"single [61s[\"-e1 about what any single sense-detecting agent does. However, there is much more to be said about the relations between two or more skin touches, because the closer together two skin spots are, the more frequently they'll both be touched at the same time. l l 0 T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E\nI I.3 NEARNESSES The reason our skin can feel is because we're built with myriad nerves that run from every skin spot to the brain. In general, each pair of nearby places on the skin is wired to nearby places in the brain. This is because those nerves tend to run in bundles of parallel fibers-more or less like this: Sensorc in skin. Ncrve'bundles. Splnal-cord agents. Nerve-bundles. Agents for repairing minor disorderings. Nerve-bundles to othar brain-ccnters. Representations of body-surface regions. Each sensory experience involves the activity of many different sensors. In general, the greater the extent to which two stimuli arouse the same sensors, the more nearly alike will be the partial mental states those stimuli produce-and the more similar those stimuli will \"seem,\" simply because they'll tend to lead to similar mental consequences. Other things being equal, the apparent similarity of two stimuli will depend on the extent to which they lead to similar activities in other agencies. The fact that the nerves from skin to brain tend to run in parallel bundles means that stimulating nearby spots of skin will usually lead to rather similar activities inside the brain. In the next section we'll see how this could enable an agency inside the brain to discover the spatial layout of the skin. For example, as you move a finger along your skin, new nerve endings are stimulated-and it is safe to assume that the new arrivals represent spots of skin along the advancing edge of your finger. Given enough such information, a suitably designed agency could assemble a sort of map to represent which spots are close together on the skin. Because there are many irregularities in the nerve-bundle pathways from skin to brain, the agencies that construct those maps must be able to \"tidy things up.\" For example, the mapping agency must learn to correct the sort of crossing-over shown in the diagram. But that is only the beginning of the task. For a child, learning about the spatial world beyond the skin is a journey that stretches over many years. T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E\nI I.4 INNATE GEOGRIPHY We've seen that touching nearby spots of skin will usually give rise to similar sensations: this is because the corresponding nerves run in parallel courses and thus cause similar activities inside the brain. The reverse is also usually true: the more similar two sensations are, the closer their origins in the skin. This has an important consequence: The neme pathways that presene the physical nearness relations of our skin-sensors can make it easy for inner agencies to discover conesponding nedrnesses about the outer world of space. Moving your hand across an object tells you something about that object's shape. Imagine what must happen when a very young infant moves its hand across some obiect: each \"ontir,r- ous motion produces a sequence of skin-sensor signals. Over time, various mapping agents can first use this information to learn, simply, which skin spots are nearest one another. Later, further layers of mapping agents could learn which skin spots lie between which others; this should be easy, too, because most small-scale motions tend to go in nearly straight lines. But then, since space itself is just a society of nearness relations between places, this is all the information we need to \"reconstruct\" the spatial structure of the skin. All this is in accord with a basic principle of mathematics: Suppose you werc lost in some unknown space-and could only tell which pairs of points were close to one another. That would be enough for you to figure a great deal about the space. From that dlone, you could deduce if you were in a world of two dimensions or three. You could tell where there were obstacles and boundaries, holes and tunnels and bridges, and so on. You could figure out the globat layout of that world from iust those local bits of information about nearnesses. It is a wonderful fact that, in principle, one can deduce the global geography of a space from nothing more than hints about which pairs of points lie near one anotherl But it is another matter to actually make such maps, and no one yet knows how the brain does this. To design a machine to accomplish such tasks, one could begin with a layer of \"correlation agents,\" one for each tiny patch of skin, each engineered to detect which other skin spots are most often aroused at nearly the same times; those will then be mapped as the nearest ones. A second layer of similar agents could then begin to make maps of larger regions, and several such layers would eventually assemble a sequence of maps on various scales, for representing several levels of detail. If brains do something of this sort, it might illuminate a problem that has troubled some philosophers: \"Why do we all ogree on what the outer world of space is like?\" Why don't different people interpret space in different, alien ways? In principle it is mathematically possible for each person to conclude, for example, that the world is three-dimensional-rather than two- or four-dimensional-just from enough experience with nearby pairs of points. However, if the wires from the skin to the brain were shuffled and scrambled around too much, we would probably never get them straightened out because the actual calculations for doing such things would be beyond our capabilities. t12 T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E\n1 I.5 SENSING SIMII.ARITIES This difficulty lof making definitionsl is increased by the necessity of explaining the words in the same language, for there is often only o,ru ,ord 1o, one idea; and though it may be easy to translate wo,rds like bright, sweet, salt, bitter, into another language, it is not easY to exPlain them- - S , q r r , l u B t - | o H N s o t t Our ways to think depend in part on how we're raised. But at the start, much more depends upon the wiring in o.ri brains. How do those microscopic features work to influence what happens in our mental worlds? The answer is, our thoughts are largely shaped by which things seii *ost similar. Which colors seem the most alike? Which forms and shapes, which smells and tastes, which timbres, pitches, pains and aches, which feelings and sensations seem most similar? Such judgments have a huge effect at every stage of mental growth-since what we Iearn depends on how we classifY. For example, a child who classified each fire just by the color of its light might learn to be afraid of eu.ryihing of orange hue. Then we'd complain that the child had \"generalized\" too much. But if that .tita \"U.rified each flame, instead, by features that were never twice the same, that child would often be burned-and we'd complain that it hadn't generalized enough' Our genes supply our bodies with many kinds of sensors-external event-detecting agents- each oiwhich sends signals to the nervous system when it detects certain physical conditions. We have sensory-agents in our eyes, ears, nose, and mouth that discern light, sound, odors, and tastes; we have agents in the skin that sense pressure, touch, vibration, heat, and cold; we have internal agents [h\"t ,.nse tensions in our muscles, tendons, and ligaments; and we have many other sensors of which we're normally unaware, such as those that detect the direction of gravity and sense the amounts of various chemicals in different parts of the body. fhe agents that sense the colors of light in human eyes are much more complex than the \"redrress agents\" of our toy machine. But this is not the reason that simple machine can't grasp what Rediess means to us-for neither can the sense detectors in our human eyes. For just as there is nothing to say about a single point, there's nothing to be said about an isolated sensory signal. When iur Redness, Touch, or Toothache agents send their signais to our brains, each by itlelf can only say, \"I'm here.\" The rest of what such signals \"mean\" to us depends on how they're linked to all our other agencies' In other words, the \"qualities\" of signals sent to brains depend only on relationships-the same as with the shapeless points of space. This is the problem Dr. |ohnson faced when creating definitions for his dictionary: each separate word like \"bitter,\" \"bright,\" \"salt,\" or \"sweet\" at- tempts to speak about a quality of a sensory signal. But all that a separate signal can do is announce its own activity-perhaps with some expression of intensity. Your foofh can't ache (it can only send signals); only you can ache, once your higherJevel agencies interpret those iignals. Beyond the raw distinctiveness of every separate stimulus, all other aspects of its char- \"Jt., o, quality-be it of touch, taste, sound, or light-depend entirely on its relationships with the other agents of your mind. T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E l 1 3\nI I.6 THE CENTERED SETF How do we learn about the real, three-dimensional world? We've seen how certain agencies might map the layout of the skin. But how could we progress from that to learn about thi world of space beyond the skin? One might ask why infants can't simply \"look around\" to see what's really going on. Unfortunately, the easy-sounding phrase \"simply look\" conceals too many hard problems. When you look at an object, some light from it shines into your eye and stimulates some sensors there. However, every motion of your body, head, or eye makes drastic changes to the image in your eye. How can we extract any useful information when everything changes so rapidly? Although it should be possible, in principle, to design a machine that could even- tually learn to relate those motions to the resulting changes in the images, this would surely take a long time, and it appears that our brains have evolved with special mechanisms that help us compensate for motions of the body, head, and eye. This makes it easier for other agencies to learn to use visual information. Later we'll discuss some other realms of thought in which we use analogies and metaphors to change our \"points of view.\" Perhaps those wonderful abilities evolved in similar ways, since recognizing that an object is the same when seen from different views is not so different from being able to \"imagine\" things that are not in view at all. In any case, we really do not understand how the child learns to understand space. Perhaps we start by doing many small experiments that lead to our first, crude maps of the skin. Next we might start to correlate these with the motions of our eyes and limbs; two different actions that lead to similar sensations are likely to have passed through the same locations in space. A critical step would be developing some agents that \"represent\" a few \"places\" outside the skin. Once those places are established (the first ones might be near the infant's face), one could proceed to another stage: the assembly of an agency that represents a network of relationships, trajectories, and directions between those places. Once this is accomplished, the network could continue to extend to include new places and relationships. However, this would be only the beginning. Long ago, psychologists like Freud and Piaget observed that children seem to recapitulate the history of astronomy: first they imagine the world as centered around themselves-and only later do they start to view themselves as moving within a stationary universe, in which the body is just like any other object. It takes several years to reach that stage, and even in their adolescent years, children are still improving their abilities to envision how things appear from other viewpoints. i 1 4 T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E\nII.7 PREDESTINED I.EARNING It would be wonderful if we could classify all behavior into two types: \"built-in\" and \"ledrned.\" But there simply is no clear-cut boundary between heredity and environment. Later, I'll de- scribe an agency that is sure to learn one particular thing: to recognize human beings. But if such an agency is destined to end up with a certain particular behavior, is it reasonable to say that it learns? Since this type of activity appears to have no common name, we'll call it \"predes- tined learning. \" Every child eventually learns to reach for food. To be sure, each different child lives through a different history of \"reaching-act\" experiences. Nevertheless, according to our theory of \"nearness models of space,\" all those children will end up with generally similar results because that outcome is constrained by the nearness relations of real-world space. Why make the brain use a tedious learning process when the 6nal outcome seems so clear? Why not build in the answer genetically? One reason could be that learning is more economical. It would require an enormous store of genetic information to force each separate nerve cell to make precisely the right connections, whereas it would require much less information to specify the construction of a learning machine designed to unscramble whatever irregularities result from a less con- strained design. This is why it isn't sensible to ask, \"Is the child's conception of space acquired or inherited?\" We acquire our conceptions of space by using agencies that learn in accord with processes determined by inheritance. These agencies proceed to learn from experience-but the out- comes of their learning processes are virtually predestined by the spatial geometry of our body parts. This kind of mixture of adaptation and predestination is quite common in biology, not only in the brain's development but in that of the rest of the body as well. How, for example, do our genes control the shapes and sizes of our bones? They may begin with some relatively precise specification of the types and location of certain early cells. But that alone would not be adequate for animals that themselves have to adapt to different conditions; therefore those early cells must themselves be programmed to adapt to the various chemical and mechanical influ- ences that may later be imposed on them. Such systems are essential for our development, since our organs must become able to perform various tightly constrained activities, yet also be able to adapt to changing circumstances. Perhaps the growth of the Society-of-More is another instance of predestined learning, for it seems to develop in every normal child without much outside help. It seems clear that this complex agency is not built directly by inborn genes; instead, we each discover our own ways to represent comparisons-yet we all arrive at much the same final outcome. Presumably, genetic hints must help with this by supplying new layers of agents at roughly the right times and places. T H E S H A P E O F S P A C E\nI I.8 IIALF-BRAINS Let's do one more experiment: touch one ear and then touch your nose. They don't feel very similar. Now touch one ear and then the other. These touches seem more similar, although they're twice as far apart. This may be in part because they are represented in related agenciJs. In fact, our brains have many pairs of agencies, arranged like mirror-images, with huge Lundles of nerves running between them. LEFT SKlll-sElttsoFs BIGHT SKIN.SENSOFS The two hemispheres of the brain look so alike that they were long assumed to be identical. Then it was found that after those cross-connections are destroyed, usually only the left brain can recognize or speak words, and only the right brain can draw pictures. More recently, when modern methods found other differences between those sides, it seems to me that some psy- chologists went mad-and tried to match those differences to every mentalistic two-part theory that ever was conceived. Our culture soon became entranced by this revival of an bld idea in modern guise: that our minds are meeting grounds for pairs of antiprinciples. On one side stands the Logical, across from Analogical. The left-side brain is Rational; the right side is Emotional. No wonder so many seized upon this pseudoscientific scheme: it gave new life to nearly every dead idea of how to cleave the mental world into two halves as nicely as a peach. What's wrong with this is that each brain has many parts, not only two. And though there are many differences, we also ought to ask about why those left-right brain halves are actually so similar. What functions might this serve? For one thing, we know that when a major brain area is damaged in a young person, the mirror region can sometimes take over its function. Probably even when there is no injury, an agency that has consumed all the space available in its neighborhood can expand into the mirror region across the way. Another theory: a pair of mirrored agencies could be useful for making comparisons and for recognizing differences, since if one side could make a copy of its state on the other side then, after doing some work, it could compare those initial and final states to see what progress had been made. My own theory of what happens when the cross-connections between those brain halves are destroyed is that, in early life, we start with mostly similar agencies on either side. Later, as we grow more complex, a combination of genetic and circumstantial effects lead one of each pair to take control of both. Otherwise, we might become paralyzed by conflicts, because many agents would have to serve two masters. Eventually, the adult managers for many skills would tend to develop on the side of the brain most concerned with language because those agencies connect to an unusually large number of other agencies. The less dominant side of the brain will continue to develop, but with fewer administrative functions-and end up with more of our lower-level skills, but with less involvement in plans and higherJevel goals that engage many agencies at once. Then if, by accident, that brain half is abandoned to itself, it will seem more childish and less mature because it lags so far behind in administrative growth.

Let's call 1t aBlock-Arch. Two standing block and a lying block. Block-Arch seems to cause a strange new phenomenon: when you push the car through it, your arm gets trapped! Then, in order to complete that action, you must release the car-and ieach around to the other side of the arch, perhaps by changing hands. The child becomes interested in this \"Hand-Change\" phenomenon and wonders how Block-Arch causes it' Soon the child finds another structure that seems similar-except that Hand-Change disappears because you can't even push the car through it. Yet both structures fit the same description! Two standing blocks and a lying block. But if Block-Arch causes Hand-Change, then this can't be a block-arch. So the child must find some way to change the mental description of Block-Arch so it won't apply to this. What is the difference between them? Perhaps this is because those standing blocks now touch one another, when they didn't touch before. We could adapt to this by changing our description of Block-Arch: \"There must be two standing blocks and a lying block. The standing blocks must not touch.\" But even this does not suffice, because the child soon finds yet another structure that matches this description. Here, too, the Hand-Change phenomenon has disappeared; now you can push the car through it without letting go! Two standing bloclcs and a lying block. The standing blocks must not touch. They must support the lying block. Again we must change our description to keep this from being considered a Block-Arch. Finally the child discovers another variation that does produce Hand-Change: Two standing blocks and something else. me sbnding bloclcs must not touch. They must supportthe other thing. The other thing may be A WEDGE OR A BLOCK. Our child has constructed for itself a useful conception of an arch, based entirely upon own experience. L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G\n12,2 TEARMNG MEANING What is learning, anyway? That word is certainly hard to define. The child in our Block-Arch scenario has found one way to learn one sense of what some adults mean by \"arch.\" But we can't assume that the same kinds of processes are involved when we learn to recite a poem, to use a spoon, and to tie a shoe. What happens when a person learns to read, learns to add numbers, learns a new language, learns to anticipate the dispositions of a friend, or learns to build a tower that will stand? If we tried to find a single definition for \"learning\" to span so many kinds of processes, we'd end up with some phrase too broad to have rnuch uJe-like this: \"Led.rning\" is making useful ehanges in the workings of our minds. The problem is that we use the single word \"learning\" to cover too diverse a society of ideas. Such a word can be useful in the title of a book, or in the name of an institution. But when it comes to studying the subiect itself, we need more distinctive terms for important, different ways to learn. Even that one Block-Arcft scene reveals at least four different wavs to learn. We'll give them these new names: Uniframing combining several descriptions into one, for example, by observ- ing that all the arches have certain common parts. Accumulating collecting incompatible descriptions, for example, by forming the phrase \"block or wedge.\" Reformulating modifying a description's character, for example, by describing the separate blocks rather than the overall shape. Trans-framing bridging between structures and functions or actions, for exam- ple, by relating the concept of arch to the act of changing hands. These words will be explained in the sections that follow. It seems to me that the older words used in psychology-such as generalizing, practicing, conditioning, memorizing, or associating -are either too vague to be useful or have become connected to theories that simply \"r\".rtt sound. In the meantime, the revolutions of computer science and Artificial Intelligence have led to new ideas about how various kinds of learning might work, and these new ideas deserve new names. Our Blocft-Arch scenario is based on a computer program developed by Patrick Winston in 1970. Winston's program required an external teacher to provide the examples and to say which of them were arches and which were not. In my unprogrammed version of this, the teacher has been replaced by the concern of some agency inside the child to account for the emergence of that mysterious Hand-Change phenomenon: why do certain structures force you to let go of the toy car, while other structures don't? We thus assume that the child is led to learn for itself in order to account for strange events. One might complain that it only makes learning harder to explain, to make it depend upon the child's curiosity. But if we are ever really to understand how our minds grow, we must first face reality: people just don't learn so well unless they're interested or concerned. The older theories of learning and remembering never got very far because in trying to oversimplify, they lost essential aspects of the context. It wouldn't be much use to have a theory in which knowledge is somehow stored away-without a corresponding theory of how later to put that knowledge back to work. L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G\nT2.3 UNIFRAMES The child in our Block-Arch scene examined several different arrangements of blocks-yet \"r,a\"j up describing them as all the same! The great accomplishment was in discovering how to d\"t\"tib. all the different instances of arch with the selfsame phrase, \"a top supported by two standing blocks that do not touch.\" I'll use the new word \"uniframe\" for this-a description corrst.rrlt.d to apply to several different things at once. How does a person make a uniframe? Our child's giock-A,rch uniframe was constructed in several steps-and each step used a different learning-scheme! The first step dissects the scene into blocks with specific properties and relationships; some were \"lying down\" or \"standing uP,\" and some were touching or sup- porting other ones. Next, we required our uniframe to insist that the arch top musf be sup- pott.iby the standing blocks: lei's call this enforcement. Then, we required our uniframe to ieject structures in which the two standing blocks touch one another; we could call this preven- tion: a way to keep from accepting an undesired situation. Finally, we required our uniframe to be neuiral about the arch iop'r shap. in order to keep from making distinctions we don't consider relevant. Let's call thattolerance. How does a person know how to choose which features and relations to enfotce, prevent, or tolerate? When we compared the two structures below, we enforced the relation that A is supported by B and C. But think of all the other differences we could have emphasized instead. A |sNoTSUPPORTCOEV B NO BLOCKSTOUCH A ncxror B UNSYMMETRICAL OISCONNECTED THREE ON GROUND G saETwEeN A AND Bffiffim- Was it wasteful to use only one of these facts when we could have used them all? Should we learn to exploit all the information we can get? No! There are good reasons not to notice too much, for every seemingly essential fact can generate a universe of useless, accidental, and even misleading facts. Most differences dre redundant. Most of the rest are accidents. For example, suppose that we already know A is supported by B. There is then no need to remember that A touches B or that A is above B-because these are things that we can figure out. For a different kind of example, suppose we knew that A was nof supported bv B. It then seems unnecessary to remember that \"A was to the right of 8.\" Common sense can tell us that if A is not on B, it must lie somewhere else. However, at least in the present context, it does not matter whether that \"somewhere else\" is to the right; another time it might iust as likely lie to the left. If we stored such details too recklessly, our minds would get cluttered up with useless facts. But how can we judge which facts are useful? On what basis can we decide which features are essential and which are merely accidents? Such questions can't be answered as they stand. They make no sense apart from how we want to use their answers. There is no single secret, magic trick to learning; we simply have to learn a large society of different ways to learn!

To learn new words or new ideas, one must make connections to other structures in the mind. \"l see you've built an arch\" should make the child connect the word \"arch\" to agencies embodying descriptions of both the Block-Arch and the Hand-Change phe- nomena-since those are what is on the child's mind. But one can't learn what something means merely by tying things to names. Each word-idea must also be invested with some causes, actions, purposes, and explanations. Consider all the things a word like \"arch\" must mean to any real child who understands how arches work and how they're made, and all the ways one can use theml A real chitd will have noticed, too, that arches are like variants of many other things experienced before, like \"bridge without a road,\" \"wall with door,\" \"tablelike,\" or \"shaped like an upside-down IJ.\" We can use such similarities to help find other things to serve our purposes: to think of an arch as a passage, hole, or tunnel could help someone concerned with a transportation problem; describing an arch as \"top held up by sides\" could help a person get to something out of reach. Which kind of description serves us best? That depends upon our purposes. Among our most powerful ways of thinking are those that let us bring together things we've learned in different contexts. But how can one think in two different ways at once? By building, somewhere inside the mind, some arches of a different kind: STRUCTURE ARCH APERTURES ree{-7 COLUMNS HOLE FUNCTION BRIDGE PASSAGES SUPPORTS '---\\ \\ DOOB WINDOW ETC. Is that a foolish metaphor-to talk of building bridges between places in the mind? I'm sure it's not an accident that we so often frame our thoughts in terms of familiar spatial forms. Much of how we think in later life is based on what we learn in early life about the world of space. t22 L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G\nL2.5 THE FUNCTIONS OF STRUCT'TIRES Many things that we regard as physical are actually psychological. To see why this is so, let's try to say what we mean by \"chair.\" At first it seems enough to say: \"A chair is a thing with legs and a back and seat.\" But when we look more carefully at what we recognize as chairs, we find that many of them do not fit this description because they don't divide into those separate parts. When all is done, there's little we can find in common to all chairs-except for their intended use. \"A chair is something you cdn sit upon.\" But that, too, seems inadequate: it makes it seem as though a chair were as insubstantial as a wish. The solution is that we need to combine at least two different kinds of descriptions. On one side, we need structural descriptions for recognizing chairs when we see them. On the other side we need functional descriptions in order to know what we can do with chairs. We can capture more of what we mean by interweaving both ideas. But it's not enough merely to propose a vague association, because in order for it to have some use, we need more intimate detiils about how those chair parts actually help a person to sit. To catch the proper meaning, we need connections between parts of the chair structure and the requirements of the human body that those parts are supposed to serve. Our network needs details like these: STRUCTURE FUNCTION - o +Chair-Bad< supports sille/s body. '+ Y <-Chair-Seat supor,rts sittet's bdy. -+ - + Chair-Legs maintain seat height. \"u J +- Chair-Legs give room lor knees. + Without such knowledge, we might just crawl under the chair or try to wear it on our head. But with that knowledge we can do amazing things, like applying the concept of a chair to see how we could sit on a box, even though it has no legs or back! \"{ No back to support body. \"0, S [,)rli Top supports sitter's b \\!T Sides maintain seat height ' I ' I No room to bed knees. Uniframes that include structures like this can be powerful. For example, such knowledge about relations between structure, comfort, and posture could be used to understand when a box could serve as a chair: that is, only when it is of suitable height for a person who does not require a backrest or room to bend the knees. To be sure, such clever reasoning requires special mental skills with which to redescribe or \"reformulate\" the descriptions of both box and chair so that they \"match\" despite their differences. Until we learn to make old descriptions fit new circumstances, our old knowledge can be applied only to the circumstances in which it was learned. And that would scarcely ever work, since circumstances never repeat themselves perfectly. L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G r23\n12.6 ACCTTMTTI.ATION Uniframing doesn't always work. We often try to make an everyday idea precise-but just can't find much unity. Then, we can only accumulate collections of examples. CHAIR TABLE SOFA BILL EULLION DEBT CREDIT It certainly is hard to find any properties that all these share. Coins are hard and round and flat. Bills are thin and flexible. Bullion has unusual weight, and credits aren't even physical. We recognize them all as media of trade-but that won't help us recognize the things themselves. The situation is the same for furniture. It's not so hard to say what furniture is for-\"things that equip a room for living in.\" But when it comes to the objects themselves, it's even hard to find a uniframe for \"chair.\" Again, its function-role seems slsss-\"6 thing one can sit upon.\" The problem is that one can sit on almost anything-a bench, a floor, a tabletop, a horse, a stack of bricks, a rock. Even defining Arch has problems, since many things we recognize as arches just don't match our Block-Arch uniframe: MONEY I ffi SINGLE LEANING STACK FIREPLACE All these shapes could be described as \"shape with hole\" or \"blocfts that bridge across d gdp.\" But those descriptions would also admit many things we don't want to regard as arches. The simplest way to learn, when one can't find a uniframe, is to accumulate descriptions of experi- ences. At first it may seem simpler to accumulate examples than to find more uniform ways to represent them. But later there's a price to pay for this: when we try to redson about things, accumulations can be nuisances-because then we'll be forced to find a different argument or explanation to justify each separate example. Most likely, different parts of our brains have evolved to use both kinds of strategies. Accumulations need not take longer to manipulate if all the examples can be handled at the same time, by separate agents that don't interfere with one another. But once those processes begin to need each other's help, the whole society's effi- ciency will decline rapidly. Perhaps that slowing-down itself might be the stimulus that makes us start to try to unify-at least for processes we use frequently. A simpler theory of when we start new uniframes would be that in the brain, there is an architectural constraint on how many Klines are directly accessible to various types of agents. For example, the agents in a certain agency might be able to accumulate no more than about seven branches for each classification in a certain hierarchy. When more than that accumulate, the agency would be forced either to merge some examples into uniframes or to turn for help from somewhere else. FURNITURE ARCH r24 L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G\nT2.7 ACCT'MTII.AITON STRATEGIES Let's make a dumbbell theory of some people's personalities. Uniframers disregard discrepancies in favor of imagined regularities. They tend to be perfectionists but also tend to think in terms of stereotypes. This sometimes lea'ds to recklessness because they have to reiect some evidence in order to make their uniframes. Accumulatorc (fie less extreme. They keep collecting eildence and hence are much less prone to make mistakes. But then they're also slower to make discoveries. Of course these imaginary personalities are only caricatures, and everyone blends both ex- tremes. Most people find some reasonable compromise, though a few of us lean more in one direction than the other. I'm sure we all use mixtures of different learning strategies-accu- mulations of descriptions, KJines, uniframes, or whatever. On the surface, it might seem easier to make accumulations than to make uniframes-but choosing what to accumulate may require deeper insight.In any case, whenever an accumulation becomes too large and clumsy, we try to replace io-. gronps of its members with a uniframe. But even when we succeed in finding a suiiably compact uniframe, we can expect it, too, to accumulate exceptions eventually, since first descriptions rarely work for all our later purposes. For example, when a child first encounters dogs, an attempt might be made to create a uniframe thit catalogs those animals'parts-eyes, ears, teeth, head, body, tail, legs, and so on. But the child will eventually have to learn that even here there are exceptions. Furthermore, that uniframe won't help answer the child's most urgent questions about any one dog in particular: Is it friendly? Does it have a loud bark? Is it the kind that tends to bite? Each such concern could require building a different kind of hierarchy-tree. This leads to an inescapable difficulty. Our various motives and concerns are likely to require incompatible ways to classify things. You can't predict a dog's bite from its bark. Each of the classifications we build must embody different kinds of knowledge, and we can rarely use more than a few of them at once. When we have a goal that is simple and clear, we may be able to select one particular kind of description that makes the problem easy to solve. But when goals of several types conflict, it is harder to know just what to do. L E A N N I N G M E A N I N G t25\n12.8 PROBTEMS OF DISI'MTY When should you accumulate, and when should you make uniframes? The choice depends upon your purposes. Sometimes it is useful to regard things as similar because they have similar forms, but sometimes it makes more sense to group together things with similai ,rrr. At one moment you may wish to emphasize a similarity; at the next moment, you may want to empha- size a distinction. Often, we have to use both uniframes and accumulations in combination. In Block-Arch, for example, we found that there could be two different kinds of arch tops-the block and the wedge. Accordingly, when we used the phrase \"block or wedge,\" we actually inserted a \"subaccumulation\" into our uniframe. ARCH /4\\ 4- /r\\ LEG (Mustnottouch) ffi ffi \\ BLocK BLocK YJ Accumulations rarely seem quite satisfactory because we feel ideas should have more unity. We wouldn't have a word for chair or arch or currency if they meant nothing more than lists of unrelated things. If each did not involve some unifying thought, we'd never think to make those lists in the first place! Why is it so hard to describe their essences? In the next few sections we'll discover a number of reasons for this. Here is one of them: Many good ideas are really two ideas in one-which form a bridge between two realms of thought or different points of view. Whenever we build a bridge between structure and function, one end of that bridge may represent a goal or use, while the other end describes what we might use to gain those ends. But it is rare for those structures to correspond neatly to those functions. The problem is that we usually find many different ways to achieve any goal. This means that we'll find an accu- mulation on the structural side of the bridge. For example, if you want to reach something high up, you can stand on a chair, reach with a stick, or ask someone taller to get it for you. Similarly, an accumulation of functions or goals can be found for any structure. My colleague Oliver Selfridge once wrote an entire book entitledThings to Do with a Stick. Our different worlds of ends and means don't usually match up very well. So when we find a useful, compdct uniframe in one such world, it often conesponds to an accumulation in our other worlds. We encountered this problem earlier. When we classified birds as animals while classifying airplanes as machines, we thereby forced disunity upon the class of things that fly. Later, when we come to theories about metaphors, we'll see that such problems are almost inevitable because we know only a very few-and, therefore, very precious-schemes whose unifying powers cross many realms. TOP ffi^ BLOCK OR WEDGE - (Accumulation) t26 L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G\n12.9 THE EXCEPTION PRINCIPTE What should one do with a law or rule that doesn't always work? We saw one way when we developed our uniframe for the Block-Arch. We simply kept changing it to fit each new example. But what if, after all that work, there still remain exceptions that don't fit? The Exception Principle: It rarely pays to tamper with a rule that nearly always works. It'i better iusi to complement it with dn ctccumulation of specific excePtions. All children learn that birds can fly and that animals that swim are fish. So what should they do when told that penguins and ostriches are birds that cannot fly, or that whales and porpoises are animals that swim but aren't fish? What should the children do with uniframes that no longer work so well? The exception principle says: Do not change them too hastily. We should ,r.u-., expect rules to be perfect but only to say what is typical. And if we try to modify each rule, to iake each exception into account, our descriptions will become too cumbersome to use. It's not so bad to start with \"Birds can fly\" and later change it into \"Birds can fly, unless they are penguins or ostriches.\" But if you continue to seek perfection, your rules will turn into monstrosities: Birds can fly, unless they are penguins and ostriches, or if they happen to be dead, or haye broken wings, or dre confined to cdges, or have their feet stuck in cement, or haye undergone experiences so dreadful as to render them psychologically inca- pable offlieht. Unless we treat exceptions separately, they'll wreck all the generalizations we may try to make. Consider why the commonsense idea of fish is so useful. It is an accumulation of general information about a class of things that have much in common: animals that live in the water, have a certain sort of streamlined shape, and move by wriggling their bodies and fanning the water with various finlike appendages. However, a biologist's idea of fish is very different, being more involved with the origins and internal mechanisms of those animals. This leads to empha- sizing aspects less evident to the eye: if whales have lungs where trout have gills, they must be uniframed in different ways. Children are disturbed to hear that whales are not fish because they are usually more concerned with uses and appearances than with origins and mechanisms. They're more likely to want classifications like these: What do those animals do? Where do they liveT Are they easy to catch? Are they dangerous? Are they useful? What do they eat? How do they taste? The power of ordinary words like \"fish\" comes from how we make them span so many meaning-worlds at once. However, in order to do this, we have to be able to tolerate many exceptions. We almost never find rules that have no exceptions-except in certain special, artificial worlds that we ourselves create by making up their rules and regulations to begin with. Artificial realms like mathematics and theology are built from the start to be devoid of interest- ing inconsistency. But we must be careful not to mistake our own inventions for natural phenomena we have discovered. To insist on perfect laws in real life is to risk not finding any laws at all. Only in the sciences, where every exception must be explained, does it make sense to pay that price. L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G 1 2 7\nt2.10 How TowERs YyoRK Why can one build a tower or arch of stone or brick, but not of water, air, or sand? To answer that amounts to asking, \"How do towers work?\" But asking that seems quite perverse, because the answer seems so obvious: \"Each block holds the next one up, and that's all there is fo if !\" As we've said before: An idea will seem self-evident-once you've forgotten learning it! We often use words like \"insight\" or \"intuition\" to talk about understandings that seem especially immediate. But it is bad psychology to assume that what seems \"obvious\" is therefore simple or self-evident. Many such things are done for us by huge, silent systems in our mind, built over long forgotten years of childhood. We rarely think about the giant engines we've developed for understanding space, which work so quietly that they leave no traces in our consciousness. How towers work is something everyone has known for so long that it seems odd to mention it: A tower's height depends only upon the heights of its parts! None of the other properties of the blocks matter-neither what they cost, nor where they've been, nor what you think of them. Only lifting counts-so we cdn build a tower by thinking only about actions that increase its height. This makes tower building easy, by letting us separate the basic building plan from all the small details. To build a tower of a certain height, iust find enough \"pieces of height\" and stack them up by lifting actions. But towers have to stay up, too. So the next problem is to find actions we can take to make our tower stable. Here we can use a second, wonderful principle: A tower is stable if each block is properly centered on the last. Because of this, we can build a tower by first lifting each block vertically and then adiusting it horizon- tally. Notice that this second kind of action-adfusting for stability-requires only horizontal movements, which do not affect the tower's height at all. This explains why towers are so easy to build. To increase a tower's height, you need only vertical lifting actions. The second-rank goal, stability, requires only horizontal sliding motions, which don't interact with height at all -provided the blocks have horizontal surfaces. This lets us achieve our tower-building goal simply by doing \"first things first.\" To adults it is no mystery that height and width are independent of each other. But this is not so evident in infancy: to understand the world of space and time, each child must make many such discoveries. Still, the division into Lifting and Sliding has a special importance; there are an infinity of ways to move around inside the world: how could a person ever learn them all? The answer: We don't need to learn them all, because we can learn to deal with each dimension separately. Lifting has a special significance because it isolates the vertical dimension from the others and relates it to ideas about balancing. The complementary operations of Sliding can then be divided into two remaining dimensions: either to push and pull or to move from side to side. One way to Lift and two ways to Slide makes three-and that is just enough to move around in a three-dimensional world! r28 L E A R N I N G M E A N I N G\nl2.l I HOW CAUSES WORK It's wonderful when we can find out something's cause. A tower is high because each of its separate blocks contribute height; it stands because those blocks are adequately firm and wide. Aiabv cries because it rvants food. A stone falls down because it's pulled by gravity. Why can we explain so many things in terms of causes and effects? Is it because there is a cause for .u\"rythi.rg-or do we meiely learn to ask only about the kinds of happenings that have causes? Is it ihat \"-\"rrr., don't exist at all but are inventions of our minds? The answer is all of the above. Causes are indeed made up by minds-but only work in certain parts of certain worlds. What are causes, any*ayZ The very concept of a cause involves a certain element of style: a causal explanation must be brief. Unless an explanation is compact, we cannot use it as a prediction. We might agree that X causes Y, if we see that Y depends more on X than on most tther things. But we wouldn't call X a cause of Y if describing X involved an endless discourse that mentioned virtually everything else in the world. There can't be dny \"cduses\" in d world in which everything that happens depends more or less equally upon everything else that happens. Indeed, it wouldn't make any sense to talk about a \"thing\" in such a world. Our very notion of a \"thing\" assumes some constellation of properties that stays the same (or changes in ways we can pr.dl\"t) when other things around it change. When Builder moves a block, that block's location will change-but not its color, weight, material, size, or shape. How convenient that our world lets us change a thing's location while leaving so many other properties unchanged! This lets us predict the effect of motions so well that we can chain them into combinations never tried before-yet still predict their principal effects. Furthermore, because our universe has three \"dimensions,\" we can easily predict the effect of combining several actions from knowing only their effects in each of those three dimensions. Why dozs a block retain its size and shape when it is moved? It is because we're fortunate enough to live within a universe in which effects are localized. A solid object with a stable shape can exist only because its atoms \"stick together\" so tightly that when you move some of them, the others are pulled along. But this can happen only in a universe whose force laws work in close accord with the \"nearnesses\" of time and space-in other words, a universe in which entities that are far apart have much less effect on each other than ones that are close together. In worlds without constraints like that, there could be no \"things\" or \"causes\" for us to know. To know the cause of a phenomenon is to know, at least in principle, how to change or control some aspects of some entities without affecting all the rest. The most useful kinds of causes our minds can discern are predictable relationships between the actions we can take and the changes we can sense. This is why animals tend to evolve sensors that detect stimuli that can be affected by those animals'own actions.

Sometimes we're told a definition of a word, and suddenly, we know a way to use that word. But definitions do not often work so well. Suppose you had to explain what \"game\" means. You could start like this: GAME: An activity in which two teams compete to make a ball do something that results in a winning score. This fits a certain range of games-but what of games that just use words, or keep no scores, or lack the element of competition? We can capture the nature of more kinds of games by using other definitions, but nothing seems to catch them all. We simply cannot find much in common to everything we call a game. Yet one still feels there is a certain unity that underlies the idea of a game. For example, we feel that we could recognize new games, and that \"game\" is more than an arbitrary accumulation. But now let's turn our attention away from the physical aspects of games and focus on the psychological purposes that games can serve. Then it is much easier to find some qualities that are common to most adult games: GAME: An actittity that is engaging and diverting, deliberately detached from real life. This second kind of definition treats a game, not as a kind of object-thing, but as a process in the mind. At first this might seem somewhat strange, but really it is nothing new-even our first definition already contained psychological elements, concealed in the words \"competing\" and \"winning. \" When seen this way, different kinds of games seem much more similar. This is because they all serve common purposes-despite the great diversity of their physical appear- ances. After all, there is virtually no limit to the variety of physical objects or structures that could be used to accomplish the same psychological purpose-in this case, to make an activity diverting (whatever that might mean). Naturally, then, it would be hard to specify the range of all the possible physical forms of games. Of course, it is no great surprise to find that \"game\" has a more psychological character than does \"brick,\" which we can define in physical terms without referring to our goals. But most ideas lie in between. We saw this in the case of \"chair,\" which we cannot describe without referring both to a physical structure and to a psychological function. 130 L E A N N I N G M E A N I N G\nI2.I3 BRIDGE-DEFINITIONS At last we're coming close to capturing the meanings of things like chairs and games. We found that structural descriptions are useful, but they always seem too specific. Most chairs have legs, and most games have scores-but there are always exceptions. We also found pur- poseful descriptions to be useful, but they never seemed specific enough. \"Thing you can sit upon\" is too general to specify a chair, since you can sit on almost anything. \"Diverting activity\" is too broad for game-since there are many other ways to turn our minds from serious things. In general, a single definition rarely works. Purposeful definitions are usually too loose. They include mdny things we do not intend. Structural definitions are usually too tight. They reiect many things we want to include. But we can often capture an idea by squeezing in from several sides at once, to get exactly what we need by using two or more different kinds of descriptions at the same time. Our best ideas are often those that bridge between two different worlds! I don't insist that every definition combine just these particular ingredients of structure and purpose. But that specific mixture does have a peculiar virtue: it helps us bridge between the \"ends\" we seek and the \"means\" we have. That is, it helps us connect things we can recognize (or make, find, do, or think) to problems we want to solve. It would be of little use to know that X's \"exist\" without some way to find and use them. When we discussed accumulation, we saw that the concepts of \"furniture\" and \"money\" have reasonably compact functional definitions but accumulate many structural descriptions. Conversely, the concepts of \"square\" or \"circle\" have compact structural definitions but accu- mulate endless collections of possible uses. To learn to use a new or unfamiliar word, you start by taking it to be a sign that there exists, inside some other person's mind, a structure you could use. But no matter how carefully it is explained, you must still rebuild that thought yourself, from materials already in your own mind. It helps to be given a good definition, but still you must mold and shape each new idea to suit your own existing skills-hoping to make it work for you the way it seems to work for those from whom you learn. What people call \"meanings\" do not usually correspond to particular and definite structures, but to connections among and across fragments of the great interlocking networks of connec- tions and constraints among our agencies. Because these networks are constantly growing and changing, meanings are rarely sharp, and we cannot always expect to be able to \"define\" them in terms of compact sequences of words. Verbal explanations serve only as partial hints; we also have to learn from watching, working, playing-ar-rd thinking.

Impossible-if we were forced to think of them in terms of blocks and how they're placed. Not one of the expressions we used before applies to all of them: neither \"three blocks,\" nor \"two blocks standing up,\" nor \"the supports must not touch.\" How could we make our minds perceive all these arches as the same? One way would be to draw this imaginary line: Now, suddenly, all those different arches fit one single frame-of a single Body with two Supports. There are two different ideas here. The first is the idea of dividing an object's description into an \"essential\" portion, namely the \"body,\" and some auxiliary portions, which correspond to the support. Later we'll see that this is a powerful idea in its own right. The second idea is even more powerful and general: after failing to find a unified description of all those arches, we abandoned the method we were using-and adopted, instead, a quite different style of description. In a word, we reformulated the problem in new terms. We started by using a language that was based on expressing the precise shapes of individual blocks. We replaced this by another language in which we can speak of shapes and outlines that are not confined to those of the blocks themselves. Reformulation is clearly very powerful-but how does one do it? How do people find new styles of description that make their problems seem easier? Does this depend upon some mys- terious kind of insight or upon some magically creative gift-or do we simply come upon them by accident? As I said when discussing creativity, these seem to me mere matters of degree, since people are always making reformulations of various sorts. Even when we contemplate those rarest and most revolutionary new ideas that come like revelations, suddenly to shed new light on entire fields of thought-like evolution, gravity, or relativity-we usually see by hind- sight that these were variants of things that people knew before that time. Then we have to ask, instead, for reasons why those reformulations were so long postponed. S E E I N G A N D B E L I E V I N G\nI3.2 BOUNDARIES ln the sky there is no distinction of east and west; people create distinctions out of their own minds and then believe them to be true. - B u n o H a What is creativity? How do people get new ideas? Most thinkers would agree that some of the secret lies in finding \"new ways to look at things.\" We've just seen how to use the Body-support concept to reformulate descriptions of some spatial forms, and soon we'll see some other ways to reformulate in terms of strength, containment, cause, and chain. But first let's look more carefully at how we made those four different arches seem the same, by making each of them seem to match \"a thing supported by two legs.\" ln the case of Single-Arch, we did this by imagining some boundaries that weren't really there: this served to break a single object into three. ffi= SUPPORT However, we dealt with Tower- Archby doing quite the opposite: we treated some real bound- aries as though they did not exist: SUPPORT How cavalier a way to treat the world, to see three different things as one and to represent one thing as three! We're always changing boundaries! Where does an elbow start or end? When does a youth become an adult? Where does an ocean change into a sea? Why must our minds keep drawing lines to structure our reality? The answer is that unless we made those mind-constructed boundaries, we'd never see any \"thing\" at all! This is because we rarely see anything twice as exactly the same. Each time we're almost certain to be looking from a somewhat different view, perhaps from nearer or farther, higher or lower, in a different color or shade of light, or against a different background. For example, consider these two appear- ances of the same table. These are qulte dlfterent when described ln terms of the actual llnes and surfaces. But when descrlbed In terms of body and support, both plctures are the same! Unless the mind could thus discard the aspects of each scene that are not essential to its present purposes, we could never learn anything. Otherwise, our recollections would rarely match appearances. Then nothing could make any sense-since nothing would seem perma- nent. 134 S E E I N G A N D B E L I E V I N G\nI3.3 SEEING AND BEIJEVING A child was asked to draw a person. Where ls the body? Why are the arms and fegs connected to the head? When questioned, many young children actually prefer these to the drawings most adults like. We normally assume that children see the same as we do and only lack our tricky muscle skills. But that doesn't explain why so many children produce this particular kind of drawing, nor why they seem so satisfied with them. In any case, this phenomenon makes it seem very unlikely that a child has a realistic, picturelike \"image\" in mind. Now let's consider a different idea. We'll suppose that the child does not have anything like a picture in mind, but only some network of relationships that various \"features\" must satisfy. For example, a child's \"person-drawing\" feature-network might consist of the following features and relations: HEAD Large closed figure. EYES Two circles, high in head. MOUTH Obiect centered below eyes. BODY Large closed ftgure. ARMS Two lines, attached high on body. LEGS Two lines, attached low on body. To convert this description into an actual drawing, the child must employ some sort of \"drawing procedure.\" Here's one in which the process simply works its way down the feature list, like a little computer program: 1. Consider the next feature on the list. 2. IF such a feature is already drawn, go to step 3. Otherwise draw it. 3. lF list is finished, stop. Otherwise, go back to step 1. When the child starts to draw, the first item on the list is \"large closed figure.\" Since there isn't any such thing yet, the child draws one: that's the head. Next the eyes and mouth get drawn. But then, when it comes to drawing the body feature, step 2 of the procedure finds that a \"large closed figure\" has already been drawn. Accordingly, nothing new is required, and the procedure simply advances to step 3. As a result, the child goes on to attach the arms and legs to the feature that has been assigned to both the body and the head. An adult would never make such a \"mistake,\" since once some feature has been assigned to represent a head, that feature is thereafter regarded as \"used up\" or \"occupied\" and cannot represent anything else. But the child has less capacity or inclination for \"keeping track.\" Accordingly, since that \"large closed figure\" satisfies the description's requirements for both the head and the body-albeit at different moments of time-there is no cause for discontent. The little artist has satisfied all the conditions required by its description! S E E I N G A N D B E L I E V I N G\nI3.4 CHITDREN'S DRAWING-FRAMES That body-head drawing seems very wrong to most adults, yet it seems to please many children. Does it really look like a person to those children? That seems like a simple question, but it is not-for we must remember that a child is not a single agent and that various other agencies inside a child's mind may not be satisfied at all. At the moment, those other agencies are not in control and have little effect. Yet if some creature came on the scene that really looked like that, most children would be terrified. It does not make much sense to speak of what a person \"teally\" sees, because we have so many different agencies. Older children tend to draw more distinct body parts and other features such as fingers and toes, hair, eyebrows, and clothes. What happened in the intervening years to make the older children draw the body separately? This could come about without even making any change in the list of features and relations we used in the previous section. It would need only a small change in step 2 of our drawing procedure: I. Consider the next feature on the list. 2. Draw such a feature, even if a similar one has already been drawn. 3. lF list is finished, stop. Otherw'ise, go back to step 1. This ensures that every feature mentioned in the list will be represented only once in the drawing, even if two such features look alike. Of course, this requires some ability to count each feature only once, and never twice. How interesting that in order to make mature, realistic drawings, the child could exploit the same kind of ability it must acquire in order to count things properlyl To be sure, we could explain the child's progress in other ways. That new and \"more realistic\" picture could come from adding a neck to the feature list, for that would demand a separate body and head. It might suffice simply to impose an additional constraint or relationship: fhaf the head be above the body. One might argue that the younger child never had a clear concept of a separate and distinct body feature in the first place; after all, there are many things that you can do with your arms and legs or with your head-but your body only gets in the way. In any case, after mastering the art of making these body-head drawings, many children seem to progress rather slowly in the art of making personal portraits, and these types of \"childish\" drawings often persist for some years. I suspect that after children learn to make recognizable figures, they usually move on to face the problems of representing much more complicated scenes. As they do this, we should continue to appreciate how well children deal with the problems they set for themselves. They may not meet our own grown-up expectations, but they often solve their own versions of the problems we pose. 136 S E E I N G A N D B E L I E V I N G\nI3.5 TEARNING A SCRIPT A,n expert is one who does not have to think. He knows. - F R e N x L r - o v o W n I c H r What will our portrait-drawing child try next? Some children keep working to improve their person pictures. But most of them go on to put their newfound skills to work at drawing more ambitious scenes in which two or more picture-people interact. This involves wonderful prob- lems about how to depict social interactions and relationships-and these more ambitious projects lead the child away from being concerned with making the pictures of the individual more elaborate and realistic. When this happens, the parent may feel disappointed at what seems to be a lack of progress. But we should try to appreciate the changing character of our children's ambitions and recognize that their new problems may be even more challenging. This doesn't mean that drawing learning stops. Even as those children cease to make their person pictures more elaborate, the speed at which they draw them keeps increasing, and with seemingly less effort. How and why does this happen? In everyday life, we take it for granted that \"practice makes perfect,\" and that repeating and rehearsing a skill will, somehow, auto- matically cause it to become faster and more dependable. But when you come to think of it, this really is quite curious. You might expect, instead, that the more you learned, the slower you would get-from having more knowledge from which to choose! How does practice speed things up? Perhaps, when we practice skills we can already perform, we engage a special kind of learning, in the course of which the original performance process is replaced or \"bridged-across\" by new and simpler processes. The \"program\" to the left below shows the many steps our novice portrait drawer had to take in order to draw each childish body-face. The \"script\" to the right shows only those steps that actually produce the lines of the drawing; this script has only half as many steps. Consider the next feature: It is not drawn, so -- DRAW HEAD Consider the next feature: It is not drawn, so --- DRAW EYES Consider the next feature: It is not drawn, so -- DRAW MOUTH Consider the next feature: A container shape ls already drawn! Consider the next feature: It is not drawn, so -- DAAW ARMS Consider the next feature: It is not drawn, so -- DRAW LEGS PROGRAM SCRIPT DRAW HEAD DRAW EYES DRAW MOUTH DRAW ARMS DRAW LEGS The people we call \"experts\" seem to exercise their special skills with scarcely any thought at all-as though they were simply reading preassembled scripts. Perhaps when we \"practice\" to improve our skills, we're mainly building simpler scripts that don't engage so many agencies. This lets us do old things with much less \"thought\" and gives us more time to think of other things. The less the child has to think of where to put each arm and leg, the more time remains to represent what that picture-person is actually doing. S E E I N G A N D B E L I E V I N G\n13.6 THE FRONTIER EFFECT We can get more insight about children from another experiment of Piaget's. A child is shown a short block resting on a longer one and is asked to draw the scene. Next the child is asked to draw a sketch of what might happen if we pushed the upper block a little to the right. At first, the result is more or less what we'd expect. But when we ask the child to do the same repeatedly, we see a strange result. The top block suddenly grows shorter as it meets the edge of the long blockl &ffid To understand what happened, lust put yourself in the child's place. You've started to draw the upper edge of the short box, but how do you decide where to stop? Younger children don't yet possess much ability to draw lines in good proportion. Instead, they tend to use procedures that locate each new feature in some recognizable relationship to other features already represented in the drawing-that is, to \"easily described places\" that have previously been depicted. Since there are no such features near the middle of the long block, the child will use the same method, whatever it is, for the first few drawings. But it is easy to describe the location of the end of the long block, and that's why this is where the younger children tend to stop, once they approach that neighborhood. Piaget called this the \"frontier effect\"-the tendency to place new features at locations that have easily described relationships to other, already represented features. Why can't children simply copy what they see? We adults don't appreciate how complicated copying really is-because we can't recall what it was like before we learned to do it. To make a good copy, the child would have to draw each line to a scale and direction consistent with all the others. But these young children are scarcely able to trace the outline of an object with a finger; they certainly cannot mentally transport an entire figure shape from one location to another. So it is actually easier for the child to do what adults might consider more \"abstract\": first to construct a mental description of the relations involved in the scene, and then to design a drawing-scheme to represent those relationships. It can require more skill to produce what we regard ai a simple copy or imitation than to produce what we consider to be an \"dbstrdct\" representation! & Moved to right tu Original r38 S E E I N G A N D B E L I E V I N G\nI3.7 DTIPHCATIONS Sometimes when we watch a scene, the wholes we see \"add up\" exactly to the sum of their separate parts. But other times, we do not mind if certain things get counted twice. In the first figure beiow, we divide an arch into body and support with no concern that both parts have eiactly the same boundaries. In the second figure, we seem to see two complete arches, despite the fact that there aren't enough legs to make two separate arches' Sometimes it is vital to keep track, to count each thing exactly once. But in other situations, no harm will come from counting twice. It is efficient to use the same block twice when making viaducts for roads for cars. But if we tried to use the same five blocks to build two separate bridges, we'd end up short. Different kinds of goals require different styles of description. When we discussed the concept of More, we saw how each child must learn when to describe things in terms of appearance and when to think in terms of past experience. The double-arch prob- lem also offers a choice of description styles. If you plan to build several separate things, you'd better keep count carefully or take the risk of running out of parts. But if you do that all the time, you'll miss your chance to make one object serve two purposes at once. We could also formulate this as a choice between structural and functional descriptions. Suppose we tried to make a match between the structural elements of the double-arch and those of two separate block-arches. In one way to do that, we would first assign three blocks to each arch-and then verify that each arch consists of a top supported by two blocks that do not touch. Then, of course, we'll only find a single three-block arch. There isn't any second arch, since there are only two blocks left. On the other hand, we could base our description of the double-arch scene on the more functional body-support style of description. According to that approach, we must focus first on the most \"essential\" parts. The most essential part of an arch is its top block-and we do indeed find two blocks that could serve as top blocks. Then we need only verify that each of them is supported by two blocks that do not touch-and this is indeed the case. In a function- oriented approach, it seems natural to count carefully the most essential elements, but merely to verify that the functions of the auxiliary elements will somehow be served. The functional type of description is easier to adapt to the purposes of higherJevel agencies. This doesn't mean that functional descriptions are necessarily better. They can make it hard to keep track of real constraints; hence they have a certain tendency to lead toward overoptimistic, wishful thought.

We can try to find a new way to look at it, to describe it in different terms. Reformulation is the most powerful way to attempt to escape from what seems to be a hopeless situation. Thus, when we couldn't find anything common to all those different kinds of arches, we changed our way of looking at them. We moved from the world of rigid, geometric block descriptions to a less constrained domain of body-support de- scriptions-and there we found a way to make a uniframe for all of them: a span supported by a pair of legs. But think of all the other ways a person might describe an arch. Aesthetic: A pleasing, shapely form. Dynamical: The top will fall if either leg is removed. Topological:The arch sunounds a hole in space. GeometricalzThe three blocks form an\"invertedU\" shape. Architectural:The arch's top could be the base of something else. Constructionalz Place two blocks, then place another duoss their tops. Circumventional: Can be used as a detour, to go around an obstacle. Transportational: Can be used as a bridge, to go from one place to another. Each of these involves a different \"realm\" of thought with its own style for describing things. And every different realm of thought can bring new kinds of skills to bear on a problem. We each learn various ways to reason about paths and obstacles; we each learn ways to deal with vertical support; with doors and windows; with boxes and bridges and tunnels; with stacks and rows and stairs and ramps. To an outsider, it may seem that a creative inventor (or designer or thinker) must possess an endless source of novel ways to deal with things. Yet inside the inventor's mind, that all might stem from variations on far fewer themes. Indeed, in that inventor's view, those styles of thought may seem so clear (and those inventions all so similar) that the question turns the other way: \"Why can't outsiders understand how to think about these simple kinds of problems?\" In the long run, the most productive kinds of thought are not the methods with which we solve particular problems, but those that lead us to formulating useful new kinds of descriptions. How do we reformulate? Each new technique presumably begins by exploiting methods already learned in other, older agencies. So new ideas often have roots in older ones, adapted for new purposes. In the next section, we'll see how that body-support idea has counterparts in virtually every realm of thought. Toward the end of this book, we'll speculate about how those various realms themselves evolve inside the mind. R E F O R M U L A T I O N l 4 l\n14.2 THE BODY. SUPPORT CONCEFT We were able to uniframe many kinds of arches by dividing each into a Body and a Support. See how well that technique works on many other sorts of things. ft€\"^h SUPPORT What makes such simple cuts seem meaningful? It is because we can imagine purposes for each. In everyday life, there is a special significance to dividing a table into \"top\" and \"legs.\" This is because the tabletop serves our principal use for a table, as \"thing to put things on.\" The table's legs serve only secondary purposes: without those legs, the top would fall-but without its top, the table has no use at all. And it would make no sense to imagine dividing that table in half, vertically, to see it as two stuck-together, L-shaped parts. This must be one reason why the body-support idea seems so universal. It is not merely a matter of physical support the more profound idea is that of building a mental bridge between a thing and a purpose. This is why bridge-definitions are so useful: they help us connect structural descriptions to psychological goals. But the point is that it is not enough just to link together descriptions from two different worlds-\"top supported by legs\" and \"thing to put things on.\" It is not enough simply to know that tables keep things off the floor. To use that knowledge, we must also know how it is done: that things have to be put on the table, rather than, for example, between the table's legs. This is where the body-support representation helps us to classify our knowledge. The \"body\" represents those parts of a structure that serve as the direct instrument for reaching the goals and the \"support\" represents all the other features that merely serve that instrument. Once we can classify the tabletop as the \"body\" of the table, we will tend to think only of using the tabletop for keeping things off the foor. Of course, we would gain even more power by under- standing how those supports assist the body's goal; that is, by understanding that the table's legs are for keeping the tabletop itself away from the floor. A good way to understand that is to have a representation of what might happen if one of the table's legs failed to perform its function. To understand how something works, it helps to know how it can fail. Dlfference in Support Structure Remove ight lq. Functional Effect on Body Left side of top falls. Right side of top falls. 142 N E F O R M U T A T I O N\nI4.3 MEANS AI{D ENDS How do we connect the things we have with the goals we want to achieve? The answer: We have many ways! Each use or purpose may suggest some corresponding way to split things up -and in each such view there will seem to be some \"most essential\" parts. These are the ones that, in such a view, appear to serve the goal directly; the rest will seem like secondary parts that only support the role of the main parts. We do this not only in the physical realm, but in many other realms as well. BODY EFFECT I I SUPPORT CAUSE Each of these dumbbell distinctions has its own style for distinguishing essential parts from supportive parts. And even in the world of physical things, we can apply these different mental views in different ways. For example, there are many ways to describe the act of standing on a table in order to be able to reach higher. Support Tables hold things away from the floor. Function Tables are for supporting things. Conclusion lf you put something on a table, its height increases. Cause-Effect I can reach higher because I start higher. Means-Ends If I want to reach higher, I can stand on a table. Even when we simply put something on a table, we're likely to employ several such descrip- tions at the same time-perhaps in different sections of the mind. The quality of our under- standing depends upon how well we move between those different realms. In order to translate easily from one of them to another, we must discover systematic cross-realm correspondences. However, finding these is rare. Usually, the situation is like that we found for chairs and games: each description-element in one world corresponds to a hard-to-describe accumulation of struc- tures in the other world. What is remarkable about the body-support concept is how often it leads to systematic cross-realm correspondences. For example, we can use it to translate \"sup- ported by,\" in the architectural realm, into \"horizontal surface underneath\" in the geometrical realm. To be sure, this correspondence fails to represent the possibility of supporting an object by suspending it from above. But some exceptions are inevitable. Our systematic cross-realm translations are the roots of fruitful metaphors; they enable us to understand things we've never seen before. When something seems entirely new in one of our description-worlds, it may turn out that when translated to some other world it resembles something we already know. Now, before you turn to the following page, try to solve this puzzle.

Indeed, the problem is insoluble unless the drawing can extend outside that area. Thus the problem is easier if one does not perceive those dots ai forming a square. We often self-impose assumptions that make our problems more difficult, and we can escape from this only by reformulating those problems in ways that give us more room. The difficulty of this problem seems more ethical than conceptual. lt feels like \"cheating\" to go outside the square. Really, there was never any square rectangle with equal sides.\" What makes were squares? in the first place-that is, in the literal sense of \"a us see so many different sorts of things as though they ',,,,, :t',',',,,,..,.t,,,..' l iri: it'i i iiri:d,:...,.:.i' .: :. .,'' i. i. .ti: ai i: ! :it:i t.:i: !- : :,t) a: :: : !: a: ::i!: ia:::::: :i,a: :: : ta a\" :': l'l:t:: i:i:!: :'::::l : :':- Some of these squares have no corners, others have no edges, and some of them have neither corners nor edges! What makes us see them all as squares? Psychologists have long wondered how we recognize such similarities bui often forgot to ask how we recognize the very simplest forms of squares in the first place. Which comes first in recognition, specific features or global shapes? It must depend upon one's state of mind. The way we perceive the world, from one moment to another, depends only in part on what comes from our eyes: the rest of what we think we see comes from inside our brain; we respond not only to visual features, but also to our remembrances of things we've seen before and to our expectations of what we ought to see. It is tempting to assume that our visual processes work only in one direction, bringing information from the world into the mind: World + Sensation ---------+ Perception ---------> Recognitior ------+ Cognition But this does not explain how what we see is influenced bv what we expect to see. Human vision must somehow combine the information that comes from the outer world wiih the structures in our memories. The situation must be more like this: Sensation Description *- Expectalion I a ,.,.,4 t, - r44 R E F O R M U L A T I O N\n14.5 BRAINSTORMING Once you set that nine-dot problem into a larger frame, you could solve it in a routine way, ,ith ;;ly-; iittle thought.

Should people always try to break their well established, seli-made mental bonds and try io ttri\"t in lesi constricted ways? Of course not. It will usually do more harm than good. However, whet yJu're really stuck, you may as well try wilder ways to find some new ideas' you might'even consider using one of the systematic, therapylike disciplines that go under names llke brainstorming, lateial thinking, meditation, and so forth. These can help, when people get badly stuck, by .n\"ontrging the search for new formulations. However, when you swittfr i-o unfamili^, ui.*, of thingi yor.r -uy get new ideas, but you also put yourself in the situation of a novice; you become less able to judge which new ideas are likely to be compatible with any of your older skills. In any case, you must not be too quick to think, How stupid it was not to see that right away! Rememter the principle of exceptibns: it may be rash to change yourself too much iust to accommodate alingle strange experience. To take every exception seriously is to risk the loss of general rules thaiprevioui expirience has shown to work most frequently. You must also be particularly wary of methods you can always use: Quit what you're doing. Find an easier Problem. Take a rest. You'll feel better afterward. Simply wait. Eventually the situation will change. Start over again. Things may work out better the next time- Such methods are foo general; they're things that one can always do, but they do not apply especially well to any particular problem. Sometimes they can help us get unstuck, but they must be tarred from usual thought-or at least be given low priority. It isn't any accident that the things that we can \"always\" do are just the ones we should rarely do. R E F O R M U L A T I O N\n14,6 THE ITWESTMENT PRINCIPIJ To him that has, more shall be given; but from him that has not, the little that he has shall be taken dwdy. - S r . M . l r r u n w Some ideas acquire undue influence. The prominence of the body-support idea is well- deserved; no other scheme compares to its ability to help us link things into causelike chains. But there are other, not so honorable ways for ideas to gather influence. The Investment Principle: Our oldest ideas have unfair advantages oyer those that come later. The earlier we learn a skill, the more methods we can acquire for using it. Each new idea must then compete against the larger mass of skills the old ideas have accumulated. This is why it's so much easier to do new things in older ways. Each new idea, however good in principle, seems awkward until we master it. So old ideas keep gaining strength, while new ones can rarely catch up. Furthermore, our oldest and best-developed skills will be the first to spread to other realms of thought where again they'll start out far enough ahead to keep any new ideas from taking root. In the short run, you will usually do better by using an old idea than by starting out anew. If you can already play the piano well, it is easy to start playing the organ in the same way. The many superficial similarities will make it hard for you to tell which aspects of your old skills are unsuitable, and the easiest course is to keep applying your old technique, trying to patch each flaw until none show. In the long run, you'd probably do better by starting fresh with a new technique-and then borrowing what you can from your older skills. The trouble is that we're almost always immersed in the \"short run.\" So the principles both of investment and of excep- tion make us reluctant to tamper with our well-established skills and uniframes lest we endanger all that we have built upon those old foundations. I don't mean to say there's anything wrong, in principle, with using what you are comfortable with and already know. But it is dangerous to support your old ideas merely by accumulating ways to sidestep their deficiencies. That only increases the power of your old ideas to overcome new ones and could lead your style of thought to base itself yet all the more, as time goes by, upon less and less. Evolution illustrates how processes can become enslaved by the investment principle. Why do so many animals contain their brains inside their heads-as with fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and bats? This arrangement was inherited long before our earliest aquatic ancestor first crawled upon the land three hundred million years ago. For many of those animals-wood- peckers, for example-another arrangement might serve at least as well. But once the pattern of centralizing so many functions in the head was established, it carried with it great networks of dependencies involving many aspects of anatomy. Because of this, any mutation that changed any part of that arrangement would disrupt many other parts and lead to dreadful handicaps, at least in the short run of evolution. And because evolution is so inherently short- sighted, it would not help if, over longer spans of time, such changes could lead to advantages. Perhaps the best example of this can be seen in the fact that virtually every detail of every plant and animal on earth is written in terms of a genetic code that has scarcely changed a single bit in a billion years. It does not seem to be a particularly efficient or reliable code, yet so many structures have been based on it that all living things are stuck with it! To change a single detail of that code would cause so many proteins to get tangled up that not a single cell could live. t46 R E F O R M U L A T I O N\nI4.7 PARTS AND HOI.ES As an example of reformulation, we'll represent the concept of a box in the form of a machine that has ^ goil. We can use this to understand the Hand-Change phenomenon. What makes a Block-Arcitrap a person's arm so that there's no way to escape except to withdraw? One way to explain this is to imagine the arch as made of four potential obstacles-that is, if we include the floor. TOP OBSTACLE LEFT OBSTACLE -.-- RIGHT OBSTACTE An obstacle is an obiect that interferes with the goal of moving in a certain direction. To be trapped is to be unable to move in any acceptable direction. Why does the block-arch form a trap? The simplest explanation is that each of its four sides is a separate obstacle that keeps us from escaping in a certain direction. (For our present purposes, we'll regard moving the hand forward or backward as unacceptable.) Therefore we're trapped, since there are only four acceptable directions-up, down, left, or right-and each of them is separately blocked. Psy- chologically, however, there's something missing in that explanation: it doesn't quite describe our sense of being trapped. When you're caught inside a box, you feel as though something is trying to keep you there. The box seems more than just its separate sides; you don't feel trapped by any particular side. It seems more like a conspiracy in which each obstacle is made more effective because of how all the other obstacles work together to keep you from going around it. In the next section we'll assemble an agency that represents this active sense of frustration by showing how those obstacles cooperate to keep you in. In order to represent this concept of trap or enclosure, we'll first need a way to represent the idea of a container. To simplify matters, instead of trying to deal with a genuine, six-sided, three-dimensional boxlike container, we'll consider only a two-dimensional, four-sided rectan- gle. This will let us continue to use our Block-Arch uniframe, together with that extra side to represent the floor. TOP - RIGHT LEFT Why focus so sharply on the concept of a container? Because without that concept, we could scarcely understand the structure of the spatial world. Indeed, every normal child spends a great deal of time learning about space-surrounding shapes-as physical implements for con- taining, protecting, or imprisoning objects. But the same idea is also important not only physi- cally, but psychologically, as a mental implement for envisioning and understanding other, more complicated structures. This is because the idea of a set of \"all possible directions\" is one of the great, coherent, cross-realm correspondences that can be used in many different realms of thousht. R E P O R M U L A T T O N 147\nI4.E THE POWER OF NEGATTT/E THINKING When life walls us in, ottr intelligence cuts an opening, for, though there be no remedy for an unrequited love, one can win release frim suffering, even if only by drawing from the lessons it has to teach. The intelligence does not recognize in life any closed situations without an outlet. - M e n c n r P n o u s r How do boxes keep things in? Geometry is a fine tool for understanding shapes, but alone, it can't explain the Hand-Change mystery. For that, you also have to know how moving worisl Suppose you pushed a car through that Block-Arch. Your arm would be imprisoned until you pulled it out. How can you comprehend the cause of this? The diagram below depicts an agency that represents the several ways an arm can move inside a rectangle. The top-lev el agent Mov'e has four subagents: Mow-Left, Move-Right, Mote-IJp, andMoye-Down. (As before, we'll ignore the possibility of moving in and out, in three dimensions.) If we connect each of these sub- agents to the corresponding side of our four-sided box frame, each agent will be able to test whether the arm can move in the corresponding direction (by seeing whether there is an obstacle there). Then, if every direction is blocked, the arm can't move at all-and that's what we mean by being \"trapped.\" The \"---o\" symbol indicates that each box-frame agent is connected to inhibit the corre- sponding subagent of Move. An obstacle to the left puts Move-Left into a can't-move state. If all four obstacles are present, then all four box-frame agents will be activated; this will inhibit all of Move's agent5-which will leave Move itself in a can't-move state-and we'll know that the trap is complete. However, if we saw aTopless-Arch, then the Move-Up agent would not be inhibited, and Moye would not be paralyzed! This suggests an interesting way to find an escape from a Topless-Arch. First you imagine being trapped inside a box-frame-from which you know there's no escape. Then, since the top block is actually missing, when your vision system looks for actual obstacles, there will be no signal to inhibit the Moye-Up agent. Accordingly, Move can activate that agent, and your arm will move upward automatically to escape! This method has a paradoxical quality. It begins by assuming that escaping is impossible. Then this pessimistic mental act-imagining that one's arm is trapped-leads directly to finding a way out. We usually expect to solve our problems in more positive, goal-directed ways, by comparing what we have with what we wish-and then removing the differences. But here we've done the opposite. We compared our plight, not with what we want, but with a situation even worse-the least desirable antigoal. Yet even that can actually help, by showing how the present situation fails to match that hopeless state. Which strategy is best to use? Both depend on recognizing differences and on knowing which actions affect those differences. The optimis- tic strategy makes sense when one sees several ways to go-and merely has to choose the best. The pessimistic strategy should be reserved for when one sees no way at all, when things seem really desperate. I48 R E F O R M U L A T I O N\nI4.9 THE INTERACTION.SOUARE What's so special about moving left or right or up or down? At first one might suppose that these ideas work only for motions in a two-dimensional space. But we can also use this square- like frame for many other realms of thought, to represent how pairs of causes interact- What is an interaction, anyway? We say that causes interact if, when combined, they lead to effects that neither can cause separately. For example, by combining horizontal and vertical motions, we can move to places that can't be reached with either kind of motion by itself. We can represent the effects oisuch combinations by using a diagram with labels like those on a compass. \\ w NW sw NNE l/T\\\" ssE Many of our body joints can move in two independent directions s[ 6nss-not the knee, but certainly the wrist, shoulder, hip, ankle, thumb, and eye. How do we learn to control such complicated joints? My hypothesis is that we do this by training little interaction-square agen- cies, which begin by learning something about each of the nine possible motion combinations. I suspect that we also base many of our nonphysical skills on interaction-square arrays because that is the simplest way to represent what happens when two causes interact. (There is even some evidence that many sections of the brain are composed of square arrays of smaller agencies.) Consider that the Spatial agency in our Society-of-More is not really involved with space at all, but with interactions between agents llkeTall andThin. [f you were told that one object A is both taller and wider than another object B, you could be sure that there is \"more\" of A. But if you were told that A is taller and thinner than B, you couldn't be sure which one is \"more.\" An interaction-square array provides a convenient way to represent all the possible combina- tions: SHORTER +SAME +TALLER THINNER I SAME I THICKER LEss LEss u'rnolher \"=\"\\l--,/rgencYr L E S S - S A M E _ M O R E ,/ l\\ '1:$T- MoRE MoRE If square-arrays can represent how palrs of causes interact, could similar schemes be used with three or more causes? That might need too many \"directions\" to be practical. We'd need twenty-seven directions to represent three interacting causes this way, and eighty-one to repre- sent four. Only rarely, it seems, do people deal with more than two causes at a time; instead, we either find ways to reformulate such situations or we accumulate disorderly societies of partially filled interaction-squares that cover only the most commonly encountered combina- tions. R E F O R M U L A T I O N 149\ncrrAPrER 1 5 CONSCIOUSNESS AND MEMORY But if this is true, dre we not led into what philosophers call an infinite regrcss, the explanation of one thing in terms of an earlier which again needs the same type of explanation? lf Constable saw the English landscape in terms of Gainsborough' s paintings, what about Gainsborough himself? We can dnswer this. Cainsborough saw the lowland scenery of East Anglia in terms of Dutch paintings which he arduously studied and copied. . . . And where did the Dutch get their vocabulary? The answer to this tybe of question is precisely what is known as the \"history of drt.\" -8. H. GougnrcH\n15.I MOMENTARY MENTAT STATE We normally assume that consciousness is knowing what happens in our minds right at the pr.r..ri ti*e.'In the next few sections, I'll argue that consciousness does not concern the iresent, but the past: it has to do with how we tlhink about the records of our recent thoughts' ^But how can thinking about thoughts be possible at all? There's something queer about describing consciousness: whatever people mean to say, they iust cait'seem to make it clear. It's not like feeling confused or ignorant. Instead', we feel we know what's going on but can't describe it properly . How could anything seem so close, yet always keep beyond our reach? There is a simple sense in which thinking about a thought is not so different from thinking about an ordinaiy thing. We know that ceitain agencies must learn to recognizs-and svsn name-the feel oi toucf,ing , hand or an ear. Similarly, there must be other agencies that learn to recognize events inside the brain-for example, the activities of the agencies that manage -.*orLr. And those, I claim, are the bases of the awarenesses we recognize as consciousness. There is nothing peculiar about the idea of sensing events inside the brain. Agents are agents -and it is as .^ry fbr an agent to be wired to detect a brain-caused brain-event, as to detect a world-caused brain-event. Indeed, only a small minority of our agents are connected directly to sensors in the outer world, like those that send signals from the eye or skin; most of the agents in the brain detect events inside the brain. But here we're especially concerned with agents that are engaged in using and changing our most recent memories. These lie at the roots of con- sciousness. Why, for example, do we become less conscious of some things when we become more \"orrr\"io,r, of others? Surely this is because some resource is approaching some limitation-and I'll argue that it is our limited capacity to keep good records of our recent thoughts. Why, for .*\"*p1., do thoughts so often seem to flow in serial streams? It is because whenever we run out oi room, the iecords of our recent thoughts must then displace those of our older ones. And why are we so unaware of how we get our new ideas? Because whenever we solve hard problemi, our short-term memories become so involved with doing that that they have neither ii-\" .ror space for keeping detailed records of what they themselves have done. What hippens when we try to think about our most recent thoughts? We examine our recent memories. But these were already involved in what we were \"thinking\" aborst-and any self' inspecting probe is prone to change iust what it's looking af. Then the system is likely to break down. It is hard enough to describe something with a stable shape; it is even harder to describe something that changes its shape before our eyes; and it is virtually impossible to speak of the shapes of things thatihange into something else each time we try to think of them. And that's whit happens when we try to think about our present thoughts-since each such thought must change bur mental statel Would any process not become confused that alters what it's looking at? In such a fix, how could one ever hope to be articulate? C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y I 5 l\nI5.2 SETF.EXAMINATION What do we mean by words like \"sentience,\" \"consciousness,\" or \"self-awareness\"? They all seem to refer to the sense of feeling one's mind at work-but beyond that, it is hard to say whether there are any differences in what they mean. For instance, suppose that you had just smiled, and someone asked if you had been conscious of this. It would scarcelv matter how that question was posed: \"Did you iust smile?\" \"Do you realize that you iust smiled?\" \"Do you remember smiling?\" \"Were you conscious of doing so?\" \"Were you awdre of it?\" Each of these questions really asks what you can say about your recent mental past. In order for you to reply truthfully, \"Yes, I know I smiled,\" your speaking-agencies must use some records about the recent activity of certain agents. But what about all the other activities involved in everything you say and do? If you were truly self-aware, wouldn't you know all those other things as well? There is a common myth that what we view as consciousness is measurelessly deep and powerful-yet actually, we scarcely know a thing about what happens in the great computers of our brains. How can we think, not knowing what it is to think? How can we get such good ideas, yet not be able to say what ideas are or how they're made? Why is it so hard to talk about our present state of mind? We've already seen several reasons for this. One is that the time-delays between the different parts of a mind mean that the concept of a \"present state\" is not psychologically sound. Another reason is that each attempt to reflect upon our mental state will change that state, and this means that trying to know our state is like photographing something that is moving too fast: such pictures will always be blurred. In any case, we aren't much concerned in the first place with learning how to describe our mental states; instead, we're more engaged with practical things, like making plans and carrying them out. How much genuine self-insight is possible for us? I'm sure our memory-machinery provides some useful clues, if only we could learn to interpret them. But it is unlikely that any part of the mind can ever obtain complete descriptions of what happens in the other parts, because, it seems, our memory-control systems have too little temporary memory even to represent their own activities in much detail. t52 C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\n15.3 MEMORY In order for a mind to think, it has to iuggle fragments of its mental states' Suppose you want to rearrange the furniture inside a room yo\" k\"o*. Your attention keeps shifting, first to one corner, then to another, next to the cenier of the room, and then, perhaps, to how the light falls on some object on ashelf. Different ideas and images interrupt each other' At one moment It ,.\"*, as though your entire mind were focused on one small detail; at another moment you might jwell on i,ftv v\"\" \"re thinking about that room in the first place; then you might find yourself comparing or contrasting two different rearrangements of that scene: \"lf that couch iurn onn, here, thei would be ,ooi for guests to chat-but no, that would block the path so that they wouldn't be able to enter.\" How do our various agencies keep track of imaginary changes in scenes? Where do the different versions go whe; out of mind, and how do we get them back again? They must be stored as memories. But what do we mean by that? Some readers may be surprised to learn that biologists still have no well-established theory of what happens in our brains when memories \"r. fo\"r*.d. Psychologists, however, do agree that there must be at least two different mecha- nisms. We appear to liave \"long-term meriories,\" which can persist for days or years or all one's life. We also haue \"short-termhemories,\" which last only for seconds or minutes. In the next few sections we'll talk mostly about the uses of these transient traces of our recent thoughts. For example, whenever we get stuck in the course of solving a problem, we need to be able to backtrack, modify our strategy, and try again. To do this we need those short-term memories, if only not to repeat the same mistake. How much d-o we remember? Sometimes we surprise ourselves by remembering things we didn't know we knew. Could this mean that we remember everything? Some older theories in psychology have supposed this to be true, and there are many legends of persons having irUrrto,rgbilities. Foie*a*ple, we often hear about people with \"photographic memories\" that enable them to quickly memorize all the fine details of a complicated picture or a page of text in a few seconds. So far as I can tell, all of these tales are unfounded myths, and only profes- sional magicians or charlatans can produce such demonstrations. In any case, I suspect we never really remember very much about a particular experience. Instead, our various agencies selectively decide, unconsciously, to transfer only certain states into their long-term memories-perhaps because they have been classified as useful, danger- ous, unusual, or significant in other respects. It would be of little use for us simply to maintain vast stores of unclaisified memories if, every time we needed one, we had to search through all of them. Nor would it be of any use for them all to flood at once into our agencies. Instead, each of us must develop fruitful and effective ways to organize our memories-but how that's done is inaccessible to consciousness. What barriers keep us from knowing such things? The next few sections sketch out some theories, both about how our memory-systems work and why we can't find this out directly by examining our own thoughts. C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y 153\nI5.4 MEMORIES OF MEMORIES Ask anyone for memories from childhood, and everyone will readily produce a handful of stories like this: My neighbor's father died when I was four. I remember sitting with my friend in front of their house, watching people come and go. lt was strange. No one said anything. It's hard to distinguish memories from memories of memories. Indeed, there's little evidence that any of our adult memories really go way back io infancy; what seem like early memories may be nothing more than reconstructions of our older thoughts. For one thing, recollections from our first five years seem strangely isolated; if we ask what happened earlier that day, the answer almost always is, \"I cdn't remember that.\" Furthermore, many of those early memories involve incidents so significant that they probably occupied the child's mind repeatedly over a period of years. Most suspicious of all is the fact that such recollections are frequently described as seen through other, older eyes-with the narrator portrayed inside the scene, right near the center of the stage. Since we never actually see ourselves, these mustbe reconstructed memo- ries, rehearsed and reformulated since infancy. I suspect that this \"amnesia of infancy\" is no mere effect of decay over time but an inevitable result of growing out of infancy. A memory is not a separate entity, apart from how it works upon the mind. To remember an early experience, you must be able not only to.\"retrieve\" some old records, but to reconstruct how your earlier mind reacted to them-and to do that, you would have to become an infant again. To outgrow infancy, you have to sacrifice your memories because they're written in an ancient script that your later selves can no longer read. We reconstruct our recent memories as well, since they portray less what we saw than what we recognized. From every moment to the next, your mental state is shaped not only by signals from the outer world, but by agents activated by the memories these evoke. For example, when you see a chair, what makes it appear to you to be a chair-rather than an assortment of sticks and boards? It must evoke some memories. Only a part of your impression comes from agents activated directly by your vision; most of what your higherJevel agencies experience comes from the memories those vision-agents activate. Usually, we have no conscious sense of this happening, and we never use words like \"memory\" or \"remembering\" when the process works quickly and quietly; instead, we speak of \"seeing\" or \"recognizing\" or \"knowing.\" This is be- cause such processes leave too few traces for the rest of the mind to contemplate; accordingly, such processes are unconscious, because consciousness requires short-term memory. It is only when a recognition involves substantial time and effort that we speak of \"remembering.\" Then what do we mean by \"memory\"? Our brains use many different ways to store the traces of our pasts. No single word can describe so much, unless it is used only in a general, informal sense. Memories are processes that make some of our agents act in much the sdme wdys they did at various times in the past. 1 F , A C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\nI5.5 THE IMMANENCE IIIUSION Everyone will readily allow that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions ofthe senses; but they never cdn entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment. . . . The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest sensation. - D n v r n H u M s We like to think of memories as though they could restore to us things we've known in the past. But memories can't really bring things back; they only reproduce some fragments of our former states of mind, when various sights, sounds, touches, smells, and tastes affected us. Then what makes some recollections seem so real? The secret is that real-time experience is just as indirectl The closest we can come to apprehending the world, in any case, is through the descriptions our agents make. In fact, if we inquired instead about why real things seem real, we would see that this depends, as well, on memories of things we've already known. For instance, when you see a telephone, you have a sense not only of the aspects you can see-its color, texture, size, and shape-but also of how it feels to hold the instrument to your ear. You also seem to know at once what telephones are for: that you speak into here and listen there;that when it rings you answer it; that when you want to call, you dial it. You have a sense of what it weighs, of whether it is soft or hard, of what its other side is like-although you haven't even touched it yet. These apprehensions come from memories. The Immanence Illusion: Wheneyer you cdn dnswer a question without a notice- able delay, it seems as though that answer were already active in your mind. This is part of why we feel that what we see is \"present\" in the here and now. But it isn't really true that whenever a real object appears before our eyes, ih full description is instantly available. Our sense of momentary mental time is flawed; our vision-agencies begin arousing memories before their own work is fully done. For example, when you see a horse, a preliminary recognition of its general shape may lead some vision-agents to start evoking memories about horses before the other vision-agents have discerned its head or tail. Perceptions can evoke our memories so quickly that we can't distinguish what we've seen from what we've been led to recollect. This explains some of the subjective difference between seeing and remembering. If you first imagined a black telephone, you probably would not find it hard to reimagine it as red. But when you see a black telephone and then attempt to think of it as red, your vision-systems swiftly change it back! So the experience of seeing things has a relatively rigid character, in contrast to the experience of imagining things. Every change that the rest of your mind tries to impose upon your vision-agencies is resisted and usually reversed. Perhaps it is this descriptive rigidity that we identify with \"vividness\" or \"objectivity.\" I do not mean to suggest that this is usually an illusion, because it often truly reflects the persistency and permanence of actual physical objects. Sometimes, though, our sense of objectivity can get reversed-as when an attitude or memory becomes more stable and persistent than what it represents. For example, our attitudes toward things we love or loathe are often much less changeable than those things themselves-particularly in the case of other people's personalities. In instances like these, our private memories can be more rigid than reality. C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\n15.6 MANY KINDS OF MEMORY We often talk of \"memory\" as though it were a single definite thing. But everyone has many kinds of memories. Some things we know seem totally detached from time, like such facts as that twelve inches make a foot or that a bull has dangerous horns. Other things we know seem linked to definite spans of time or space, like memories of places where we've lived. Still other recollections seem like souvenirs of episodes we can reexperience: \"Once, when visiting my grandparents,I climbed an old apple tree.\" A brain has no single, common memory system. lnstead, each part of the brain has several types of memory-agencies that work in somewhat different ways, to suit porticular purposes. Why do we have so many kinds of memory? If memories are records of our mental states of earlier times, how are those records stored and kept? A popular image of memories is that they are like objects we store away in various \"places\" in the brain. But then what are those places like? How do memories get into them and come out again? And what takes place inside of the vaults in which they're stored? Are memory banks like freezer chests where time stands still, or do their contents interact? How long can our old memories remain; do some of them grow old and die, do they get weak and fade away or just get lost and never found? We have the impression that even our long-term memories become harder to recall as time goes on, and that might lead us to suppose that they have some inherent tendency to fade away. But even that is uncertain; it could simply be because so many other memories begin to interfere with them. Most likely, some types of memory mechanisms retain the records of sensations only for seconds; we use others to adopt habits, goals, and styles that we hold only for days or weeks; and we make personal attachments that endure through many months or years. Yet suddenly, from time to time, we'll modify some memories that seemed, till then, quite permanent. More evidence that there are many kinds of memory has come from accidental injuries to brains. One injury may cause the loss of abilities to deal with names; another injury can make you lose some capacity to recognize faces or to remember musical tunes; still other kinds of injuries can leave unchanged what you have learned in earlier times but keep you from learning anything more in some particular domain. There is evidence that long-term memories can never form at all unless their short-term antecedents are permitted to persist for certain inter- vals; this process can also be blocked by various drugs and injuries, and this is why some people can never recollect what happened in the minutes before a brain concussion. Finally, it appears that there are strong limitations on how rapidly we can construct our long- term memories. Despite all the legends about prodigies, there seems to be no evidence from any well-designed experiments that any human being can continue to construct long-term memories, over any substantial interval of time, more than two or three times faster than the average person. I56 C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\nI5.7 MEMORY REARRANGEMENTS Let's return to moving mental furniture. What would we need to imagine moving things around a room? First we'd need some way to represent how objects are arranged in space. In our Blocft-Arch scenario, the scene was represented in terms of the shapes of the obiects and the relations between them. In the case of a room scene, you might also relate each object to the walls and corners of the room; you might notice that the couch is about midway between a table and a chair, and that all three are lined up near a certain wall. Once we have a method for representing rooms, we also need techniques for manipulating these representations. How could we envision the result of exchanging that couch and chair? Let's oversimplify, and suppose that this can be done simply by exchanging the states of two agencies-an agency A, which represents the couch, and another agency B, which represents the chair. To exchange these states, let's assume that both agencies have access to two \"short- term memory-units,\" called M-l and M-2, which can record the states of agencies. Then we can exchange the states of A and B, first by storing away the states A and B, and then by restoring them in reverse order. In other words, we could use the following simple four-step \"script\": l. Store the state of A in M-1. 2. Store the state of B in M-2. 3. Use M-2 to determine the state of A. 4. Use M-| to determine the state of B. A \"memory-control script\" like this can work only if we have memory-units that are small enough to pick out couch-sized portions of the larger scene. M-l and M-2 would not do the job if they could store only descriptions of entire rooms. In other words, we have to be able to connect our short-term memories only to appropriate aspects of our current problems. Learn- ing such abilities is not simple, and perhaps it is a skill some people never really master. What if we wanted to rearrange three or more objects? As a matter of fact, it is possible to produce Lny reafiangement whatsoever, using only operations that exchange two objects at a time! When you approach an unfamiliar kind of problem, it's best to start by making only one or two changes at a time. Then, in the course of becoming an expert, you discover schemes that make several useful changes in memory at once. Our pair-exchanging script needs more machinery. Because each memory-unit must wait until the previous step is finished, the timing of each script step may have to depend on various \"condition sensors.\" Shortly we'll see that even this is not enough to solve hard problems; our memory-control processes also need ways to interrupf themselves while they call on other agencies or memories for help. Indeed, the problems we must solve when managing our mem- ories are surprisingly like those we face when dealing with things in the outside world. C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\nIs.E ANATOMY OF MEMORY What controls the working of the mind from one moment to the next? How do we keep our place when doing complicated jobs, so that when interrupted from outside-or by another thought from inside-we can \"get back\" to where we were, instead of having to start all over again? How do we keep in mind which things we've tried and what we've learned along the way, so that we don't go round and round in loops? No one yet knows how memories control themselves inside our brain; perhaps each major agency has somewhat different processes, each suited to the special kinds of iobs it does. The diagram below suggests some of the sorts of memory-machinery we'd expect to find inside a typical large agency. Layers of Long-Term Memories Signals\" from otheragencies---- l/lemory-Gontrol Memorles We'll assume that every substantial agency has several \"micromemory-units,\" each of which is a sort of temporary K-line that can quickly store or restore the state of many of the agents in that agency. Each agency also has several \"short-term memory-units,\" which can, in turn, store or restore the states of the micromemories themselves. When any of these temporary memory- units are reused, the information that was stored in them is erased-unless it has somehow been \"transferred\" into more \"permanent\" or \"long-term\" memory-systems. There is good evidence that, in human brains, the processes that transfer information into long-term memory are very slow, requiring time intervals that range from minutes to hours. Accordingly, most temporary memories are permanently lost. A growing child acquires many ways to control all these mechanisms. Accordingly, our diagram includes the flow of information among the other agencies. Since this memory- controlling agency must also learn and remember, our diagram includes a memory-system for it as well. I58 C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\nI5.9 INTERRTTPTION AND RECOVERY lmagine that you plan to take a trip. You start to think of how you'll pack your traveling case and start some spatial problem-solving agency-callitPacker-to see how to fit the larger items in. Then you interrupt yourself to think about your smaller things, perhaps of how to pack your jewelry in a smaller box. Now Pacfter has to reapply itself to a new and different box-packing problem. The problem of keeping track of what is happening is hard enough when one agency calls on another one for help. Until the other's job is done, the first agency has to keep some temporary record of what it was doing. In Packey's case the problem is even worse because it interrupts itself to pack the smaller box. And here is the important point: when that second packing job is done and we return to the first, we mustn't go all the way back to the very beginning, or else we would be caught in a circular loop. Instead, we must return to the point where we were when we intenupted ourselves-which means the system needs some memory to keep track of what it was doing before. This is exactly the same problem we mentioned long ago when Find and See had several different jobs to do at the same time. Why do we so often get confused when we're interrupted? Because then we have to keep our place in several processes at once. To keep things straighi, our memory-control machinery needs intricate skills. Yet psychologically, we're unaware that ordinary thinking is so compli- cated. [f someone asked, \"What wds your mind iust doing?\" you might say something like this: \"I wds thinking about packing that suitcase, and started to wonder if the umbrella might fit. I remembered that on dn earlier trip,l managed to fit my camerd tripod in the sdme cdse, and I tried to compare the umbrella and the tripod in my mind, to see which one wds longer.\" Now, this might be a true account of some of the things you were thinking about. But it says little of how the mental work was actually done. To understand how thinking works, we'd really need descriptions of the processes themselves: \" A few moments ago, I activated two micromemory-units inside Packer, one of my space-ananging agencies, while also activating one of Packer's memory-control scripts. This script proceeded to use the information inside those two micro- memory-units as cues to fetch certain partial states from the long-term memory- system attached to Packer. Next, the script controlling Packef s memory-system requested a certain higher-level planning-agency to record most of Packei s present state. Then it interchanged the contents of the two actiye micromemory units, and then used other cues to fetch another, second script from long-term memory-and thus erased the present copy of itself. The last step of that second script caused yet another micromemory-unit to restore Packer to its previous state, so that the orig- inal script could continue on its interrupted course. Then . .\" But no one ever says such things. The processes are too many levels away from those we use to work the short-term memories involved with language and consciousness. We couldn't think so if we wanted to-without knowing more about the anatomy of our memory-machinery. Even if we had ways to represent those processes at higher levels, our memory-controls ro.,id probably be overloaded by attempting, both at the same time, to solve a difEcult problern and to remember everything that was done while solving it. C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y I59\nI5.IO TOSING TRACK Whenever we solve complicated problems, we get into situations in which our agencies must keep account of many processes at once. In computer programs, the many \"subiobs\" often seem to pile up like the blocks of a tower. Indeed, computer programmers often use the word \"stack\" to describe such situations. But I doubt that untrained human minds use anything so methodical; in fact, we simply aren't very good at dealing with the kinds of situations that need such memory-stacks. This could be why we get confused when hearing sentences like this: This is the malt that the rat that the cat that the dog wonied killed ate. The very same words can be rearranged to make an equivalent sentence anyone can under- stand: This is the dog that wonied the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt. The first sentence is hard to understand because so many verb processes interrupt one another that when the end of the sentence comes, three similar processes are still active-but they have lost track of what roles should be assigned to all the remaining nouns, namely, the rat, cat, and malt. Why do visual processes so rarely encounter similar difficulties? One rea- son is that our visual-systems can support more simultaneously operating processes than our language-systems can, and this reduces the need for any process to interrupt another one. A second reason is that the vision-agencies can choose for themselves the sequence in which they attend to details, whereas language-agencies are controlled by the person who is speaking. lt takes each person many years to learn to use those memory-systems well. Younger children certainly cannot keep track as well as adults. It's generally of little use to ask a pair of two-year- olds to play together or to take turns at using a toy. We consider them to be too self-centered and impatient for that. Surely much of their undisciplined impulsiveness comes from desires that are less regulated than our own. But that impatience could also stem from insecurity about memory: the child may fear that what it wants will slip from mind while other thoughts are entertained. In other words, the child who is asked to \"take turns\" might fear that by the time its turn arrives, it may not want the object anymore. When people ask, \"Could a machine ever be conscious?\" I'm often tempted to ask back, \"Could \"-p.iron ever be conscious?\" I mean this as a serious reply, because we seem so ill equipped io understand ourselves. Long before we became concerned with understanding how we work, our evolution had already constrained the architecture of our brains. However, we can design our new machines as we wish, and provide them with better ways to keep and examine-records of their own activities-and this means that machines are potentially capable of far more consciousness than we are. To be sure, simply providing machines with such information would not automatically enable them to use it to promote their own development, and until we can design more sensible machines, such knowledge might only help them find more ways to fail: the easier to change themselves, the easier to wreck themselves-until they learn to irain themselves. Fortunately, we can leave this problem to the designers of the future, who surely would not build such things unless they found good reasons to' 160 C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y\nI5.I I THE RECI'RSION PRINCIPTE Let's consider one last time how a mind could juggle nonexistent furniture inside an imagi- nary room. To compare different arrangements, we must somehow maintain at least two different descriptions in the mind at once. Can we store them in different agencies, both active at the same time? That would mean splitting our space-arranging-agency into two different smaller portions, each working on one of those descriptions. On the surface, there's nothing clearly wrong with that. However, if those smaller agencies became involved with similar jobs, then they, in turn, would also have to split in two. And then we'd have to do each of those lobs with but one-quarter of a mind. If we had to divide agencies into smaller and smaller fragments, each job would end up with no mind at all! At first this might seem to be an unusual situation. But it really is very common. The best way to solve a hard problem is to break it into several simpler ones, and break those into even simpler ones. Then we face the same issue of mental fragmentation. Happily, there is another way. We can work on the various parts of a problem in serial order, one after another, using the same agency over and over again. Of course, that takes more time. But it has one absolutely fundamental advantage: each agency can apply its full power to every subproblem! The Recursion Principle; When a problem splits into smaller parts, then unless one cdn apply the mind's full power to each subiob, one's intellect will get dispersed and leaye less cleyerness for each new task. Indeed, our minds don't usually shatter into helpless fragments when problems split into parts. We can imagine how to pack a jewelry box without forgetting where it will fit into a suitcase. This suggests that we can apply our full space-arranging resources to each problem in turn. But how, then, do we get back to the first problem, after we've thought about the other ones, without having to start all over again? To common sense the answer seems clear: we simply \"remember where we were.\" But this means that we must have some way to store, and later re-create, the states of interrupted agencies. Behind the scene.s, we need machinery to keep track of all the incomplete accomplishments, to remember what was learned along the way, to compare different results, and to measure progress in order to decide what to do next. All this must go on in accord with larger, sometimes changing plans. The need to recall our recent states is why our \"short-term memories\" are short-term memo- ries! In order to do their complex jobs so quickly and effectively, each micromemory-device must be a substantial system of machinery, with many intricate and specialized connections. [f so, our brains cannot afford to make too rnany duplicate copies of that machinery, so we must reuse what we have for different iobs. Each time we reuse a micromemory-device, the infor- mation stored inside must be erased-or moved to another, less costly place. But that would also take some time and interrupt the flow of thought. Our short-term memories must work too fast to have any time for consciousness. C O N S C I O U S N E S S A N D M E M O R Y 1 6 1\nCHAPTER 7 5 EMOTION Each emotion has its own world view. Love includes and merges and nurtures loy is light and dances even with the eyes Crief heavy, hopeless, and the lungs empty, as is the heart and Hate wants to destroy, to kill, that is its very ndture and almost involuntarily, matter of factly, another part of me says \"es ist das hier ia nicht unbekannt.\" -MeNpnro CrvNBs\nI6.I EMOTION Why do so many people think emotion is harder to explain than intellect? They're always saying things like this: \"I understand, in principle, how a computer might solve problems by reasoning. But I can't imagine how a computer could haye emotions, or comprehend them. That doesn't seem at all the sort of thing machines could eyer do.\" We often think of anger as nonrational. But in our Challenger scenario, the way that Work employs Anger to subdue S/eep seems no less rational than using a stick to reach for something beyond one's grasp. Anger is merely an implement that Work can use to solve one of its problems. The only complication is that Worft cannot arouse Anger directly; however, it discov- ers a way to do this indirectly, by turning on the fantasy of Professor Challenger. No matter that this leads to states of mind that people call emotional. To Worft it's merely one more way to do what it's assigned to do. We're always using images and fantasies in ordinary thought. We use \"imagination\" to solve a geometry problem, plan a walk to some familiar place, or choose what to eat for dinner: in each, we must envision things that aren't actually there. The use of fantasies, emotional or not, is indispensable for every complicated problem-solving process. We always have to deal with nonexistent scenes, because only when a mind can change the ways things dpped\"r to be can it really start to think of how to change the ways things cre. In any case, our culture wrongly teaches us that thoughts and feelings lie in almost separate worlds. In fact, they're always intertwined. In the next few sections we'll propose to regard emotions not as separate from thoughts in general, but as varieties or types of thoughts, each based on a different brain-machine that specializes in some particular domain of thought. In infancy, these \"protospecialists\" have little to do with one another, but later they grow together as they learn to exploit one another, albeit without understanding one another, the way Worft exploits Anger to stop Sleep. Another reason we consider emotion to be more mysterious and powerful than reason is that we wrongly credit it with many things that reason does. We're all so insensitive to the complexity of ordinary thinking that we take the marvels of our common sense for granted. Then, when- ever anyone does something outstanding, instead of trying to understand the process of thought that did the real work, we attribute that virtue to whichever superficial emotional signs we can easily discern, like motivation, passion, inspiration, or sensibility. In any case, no matter how neutral and rational a goal may seem, it will eventually conflict with other goals if it persists for long enough. No long-term project can be carried out without some defense against competing interests, and this is likely to produce what we call emotional reactions to the conflicts that come about among our most insistent goals. The question is not whether intelligent machines can have anv emotions, but whether machines can be intelligent without any emotions. I suspect that once we give machines the ability to alter their own abilities we'll have to provide them with all sorts of complex checks and balances. It is probably no accident that the term \"machinelike\" has come to have hvo opposite connotations. One means completely unconcerned, unfeelin g, and emotionless, devoid of any interest. The other means being implacably committed to some single cause. Thus each suggests not only inhu- manity, but also some stupidity. Too much commitment leads to doing only one single thing; too little concern produces aimless wanderrng. E M O T I O N\n16.2 MENTAT GROWTH In ancient times it was believed that the newborn mind started out just like a full-grown mind, except for not yet being filled with ideas. Thus children were seen as ignorant adults, conceived with all their future aptitudes. Today, there are many different views. Some modern theories see a baby's mind as starting with a single Self whose problem is to learn to distinguish itself from the rest of the world. Others see the infant's mind as a place containing a horde of mind-fragments, mixed together in a disconnected and incoherent confusion in which each must learn to interact and cooperate with the others so that they can grow together to form a more coherent whole. Yet another image sees the child's mind as growing through a series of layerlike construction stages in which new levels of machinery are based and built upon the older ones. How do our minds form? Is every person born containing a hidden, built-in intellect iust waiting to reveal itself? Or must minds grow in little steps from emptiness? The theories of the next few sections will combine ingredients from both these conceptions. We'll start by envision- ing a simple brain composed of separate \"proto-specialists,\" each concerned with some impor- tant requirement, goal, or instinct, like food, drink, shelter, comfort, or defense. But there are reasons why those systems must be merged. On one side, we need administrative agencies to resolve conflicts behveen the separate specialists. On the other side, each specialist must be able to exploit whatever knowledge the others gain. For a relatively simple animal, a loose-knit league of nearly separate agencies with built-in goals might suffice for surviving in a suitable environment. But human minds don't merely l.\"rr n.* ways to reach old goals; we can also learn new kinds of goals. This enables us to live within a broader range of possible environments, but that versatility comes with its own dan- gers. If we could learn new goals without constraint, we'd soon fall prey to accidents-both in ihe world and inside our own minds. At the simplest levels, we have to be protected against such accidents as learning not to breathe. On higher levels, we need protection against acquir- ing lethal goals like learning to suppress our other goals entirely-the way that certain saints and mystici do. What sorts of built-in self-constraints could guide a mind toward goals that will not cause it to destroy itself? No possible inheritance of built-in genes can tell us what is good for u3-!ss4u5e, unlike all other animals, we humans make for ourselves most of the problems we face. Accordingly, each human individual must learn new goals from what we call the traditions and heritages of our peers and predecessors. Consequently our genes must build some sort of \"general-purpose\" hachinery-through which individuals can acquire and transmit goals and values from one generation to another. How could brain-machines transfer things like values and goals? The next few sections suggest that this is done by exploiting the kinds of personal relationships we call emotional, such as fear and affection, attachment and dependency, or hate and love. t64 E M O T I O N\n16.3 MENTAJ. PROTO-SPECI.AIISTS Suppose you had to build an your animal to do. Then you'd artificial animal. First you'd make a list of everything you want ask your engineers to find a way to meet each need. This diagram depicts a separate agency for each of several \"basic needs.\" Let's call them \"proto-specialists.\" Each has a separate mini-mind to do its job and is equipped with special sensors and effectors designed to suit its specific needs. For example, the proto-specialist for Thirst might have a set of parts like these: It would not usually be practical to make an animal that way. With all those separate special- ists, we'd end up with a dozen different sets of heads and hands and feet. Not only would it cost too much to carry and feed all those organs; they'd also get in one another's wayl Despite that inconvenience, there actually do exist some animals that work this way and thus can do many things at once. Genetically, the swarms of social ants and bees are really multibodied individuals whose different organs move around freely. But most animals economize by having all their proto-specialists share common sets of organs for their interactions with the outer world. Another kind of economy comes from allowing the proto-specialists to share what they learn. Whether you seek warmth, safety, nutrition, or companionship-eventually you'll have to be able to recognize and act in order to acquire the objects you need. So even though their initial goals are entirely different, all those different proto-specialists will end up needing to solve the same sorts of \"subproblsp5\"-511sh as finding ways around obstacles and deciding how to conserve limited resources. Whenever we try to solve problems of increasing complexity, what- ever particular techniques we already know become correspondingly less adequate, and it becomes more important to be able to acquire new kinds of knowledge and skills. In the end, most of the mechanisms we need for any highly ambitious goal can be shared with most of our other eoals. When a dog runs, it moves its legs. When a sea urchin runs, it is moyed by its legs. - l e , r o B v o N U E x x U r - r - E M O T I O N 165\n16.4 CROSS-EXCLUSION An ordinary single-bodied animal can only move in one direction at a time, and this tends to constrain it to work toward only one goal at a time. For example, when such an animal needs water urgently, its specialist for \"thirst\" takes control; however, if cold is paramount, finding warmth takes precedence. But if several urgent needs occur at once, there must be a way to select one of them. One scheme for this might use some sort of central marketplace, in which the urgencies of different goals compete and the highest bidder takes control. However, that strategy is prone to fall into a funny, fatal indecisiveness. To see the problem, imagine that our animal is both very hungry and very thirsty. Suppose that our animal's hunger is, at first, iust slightly more urgent than its thirst . So i f sets out on a trek toward the N orth Plain, where food is usually found. When it anives and takes a bite of food, its thirst instantly takes precedence over its need for food! Now that thirst has top priority, our animal sets out on the long iourney toward South Lake. But once it anives and takes one satisfying sip, the balance instantly tips back to food! Our animal is doomed to iourney back and forth, getting hungrier and thirstier. Each action only equalizes eyer-growing urgencies. This would be no problem at a dinner table, where food and drink are both within easy reach. But under natural conditions, no animal could survive the waste of energy, when every minor fluctuation caused a major change in strategy. One way to manage this would be to use that \"marketplace\" infrequently-but that would make our animal less capable of dealing with emergencies. Another way is to use an arrangement called cross-exclusion, which appears in many portions of the brain. In such a system, each member of a group of agents is wired to send \"inhibitory\" signals to all the other agents of that group. This makes them competitors. When any agent of such a group is aroused, its signals tend to inhibit the others. This leads to an avalanche effect-as each competitor grows weaker, its ability to inhibit its challengers also weakens. The result is that even if the initial difference between competitors is small, the most active agent will quickly \"lock out\" all the others. ln each case, the aetivity of the shaded agent suppresses the activity of its competitors, through the inhibitory connections. Two Examples of Gross-Exclusion Cross-exclusion arrangements could provide a basis for the principle of \"noncompromise\" in regions of the brain where competitive mental agents lie close together. Cross-exclusion groups can also be used to construct short-term memory-units. Whenever we force one agent of such a group into activity, even for a moment, it will remain active (and the others will remain suppressed) until the situation is changed by some other strong external influence. Weaker external signals will have scarcely any effect at all because of resistance from within. Why call this a short-term memory if it can persist indefinitely? Because when it does get changed, no trace will remain of its previous state. r66 E M O T I O N\n16.5 AVAI.ANCHE EFFECTS Few of the schemes we've discussed would actually work if they were built exactly as they were described. Most of them would soon break down because virtually all their agents would become engaged into unconstrained activity. Suppose each typical agent tends to arouse several others. Then each of those would turn on several more-and each of those would turn on yet others; the activity would spread faster than a forest fire. But all that activity would accomplish nothing, since all those agents would interfere with each other and none of them could gain control of the resources they need. Indeed, this is more or less what happens in an attack of epilepsy. Similar problems arise in every biological system. Each simple principle or mechanism must be controlled to operate within some limited range. Even little groups of genes embody schemes to regulate the quantities of proteins they cause to be manufactured inside every cell. We find the same pattern repeated on every scale. Every biological tissue, organ, and system is regulated by several kinds of control mechanisms, and wherever these fail we find disease. What normally protects our brains from such avalanches of activity? The cross-exclusion scheme is probably the most usual way to regulate the levels of activities within our agencies. But there are also several other frequently encountered schemes to prevent explosions. Conservation: Force all activities to depend upon some substance or other kind of quantity of which only a certain amount is available. For example, we controlled our Snarc machine by setting a limit on the total electric cunent available to all the agents; this permitted only a few of them to be actiye at any particular moment. Negative Feedback: Supply d \"summary\" device that estimates the total activity in the dgency and then broadcasts to that dgency an \"inhibitory\" signal whose strength is in proportion to that total. This will tend to damp down incipient ayalanches. Censors and Suppressors: The \"conserydtion\" and \"feedback\" schemes tend to be indisuiminate. Later we'Il discuss methods that are more sensitiye and yersatile in learning to recognize-and then to attoid-specific patterns of actitity that have led to trouble in the past. These methods are simple enough to be applied inside small societies, but they are not versatile enough to solve all the management difficulties that can arise in the more complex societies we need for learning to solve harder problems. Fortunately, systems built upon larger scales may be able to apply their own enhanced abilities to managing themselves-by formulat- ing and solving their own self-regulation problems. In the next few sections we'll see how such capacities could grow in the course of several stages of development. Not all of this need happen independently inside each separate child's mind, because that child's family and cultural com- munity can develop self-regulation schemes of great complexity. All human communities seem to work out policies for how their members ought to think, in forms that are thought of as common sense or as law, religion, or philosophy. E M O T I O N\nI6,6 MOTTVATION Imagine that a thirsty child has learned to reach for a nearby cup. What keeps that child, afterward, from reaching for a cup in every other circumstance-say, when it is lonely or when it is cold? How do we keep separate what we learn for satisfying different goals? One way is to maintain a separate memory bank for every distinct goal. &pante Knowledge Banks for Every proto-qecialist To make this work, we must restrict each specialist to learn only when its own goal is active. We can accomplish that by building them into a cross-exclusion system so that,-for example, Hunger's memories can be formed only when Hunger is active. Such a system'will never'gei confused about which memories to use. When it is hungrv it will do only what it learned to do at previous times when it was hungry; it won't eat when it is thirsty or drink when it is hungry. But it would be too extravagant to have to keep completely different memories for every go\"t- since, as we said, most real-world goals engage the same kinds of knowledge about the world. Wouldn't it be better if all those specialists could share a common, general-purpose memory? Knowledge-Bases Growing into One Another This would lead to problems, too. Whenever any specialist tried to rearrange some memories to its own advantage, it might damage structures upon which the others havi come to depend. There would be too many unpredictable interactions. How could specialists cooperate and share what they have learned? If they were like people, they could communicate, negotiate, and organize. But because each separate specialist is much too small and specialized to under- stand how the others work, the best each can do is learn to exploit whai the others can do, without understanding how they do it. t68 E M O T I O N\nT6.7 EXPTOITATION How could any specialist cooperate when it doesn't understand how the others work? We manage to do our worldly work despite that same predicament; we deal with people and ma- chines without knowing how their insides work. It's just the same inside the head; each part of the mind exploits the rest, not knowing how the other parts work but only what they seem to do. Suppose Thirst knows that water can be found in cups-but does not know how to find or reach for a cup; these are things only FindandGet can do. Then Thlrst must have some way to exploit the abilities of those other agents. Builder, too, has a similar problem because most of its subagents cannot communicate directly with one another. It would be easy for Thitst or Builder simply to turn on other agents like Find and Get. But how will those subordinates know what to find or get? Must Thirst transmit to Find a picture of a cup? Must Builder send a picture of a brick? The trouble is that neither Builder nor Thirst is the sort of agent to contain the kind of knowledge required by Find-namely, the visual appearances of things. That kind of knowl- edge lies inside the memory-machinery of See. However, Thirst can achieve its drinking goal by activating fwo connections: one to cause See to \"hallucinate\" a cup and another connection to activate Find. Find itself can activate Getlater. This should suffice for Thirst to locate and obtain a cup-if there is one in sight. RCDPILli:cui,sfpre,i:ii toiotiafi :,:alr:i?ft|?; ffilAFjo|,:,cai 'freachi:fot,liltt This scheme could be unreliable. If See became concerned with another obiect at that moment, Gef would acquire the wrong object. Infants often disappoint themselves this way. Still, this scheme has the kind of simplicity one needs when starting to build any larger skill: one needs a process that sometiines works before one can proceed to improve it. This is merely a sketch of how to build an automatic \"getting machine.\" We'll return to this idea much later, when we discuss language, because what Thirsf and Builder have to do resembles what people do when using words. When you say to another person, \"Please pass the cup,\" yor don't emit a picture of a cup but merely send a signal that exploits the other person's memory. Achieving a goal by exploiting the abilities of other agencies might seem a shabby substitute for knowing how to do the work oneself. Yet this is the very source of the power of societies. No higher-level agency could ever achieve a complex goal if it had to be concerned with every small detail of what each nerve and muscle does. Unless most of its work were done by other agencies, no part of a society could do anything significant. E M O T I O N 169\n16.8 STrMUrus vs. SIMULUS - We've just seen how one agency could exploit another one by focusing its attention on some obiect in the outer world. Thus Thirst can make Get reach foi \" \",rp-irovided there's \".up in view. But what about that fantasy about Professor Challenger, ir, rhich there was no real villain on the scene, but just a memory? Apparently one agency can activate another merely by imagining a stimulus! One way to do this would be for Anger to somehow construct an artificial picture that other agencies like See could \"see.\" If this weie done with enough detail, the other agents couldn't tell that the image wasn't genuine. However, to construct the sorts of images we see on television screens, we'd have to activate a million different sensory nerves, which would require a huge amount of machinery. Besides, r. .olld do more with le;s: A fantasy need not reproduce the fine details of an actual scene. lt need only reproduce that scene's effect on other agencies. . Fantasies usually \"depict\" occurrences we've never seen. They need no detailed, realistic images-since the higher levels of the mind don't really \"see\" things anyway! Instead, they deal with summaries of signals that come from sensory experien\". ,nd aie condensed at several levels along the way._ln-th-e fantasy of Professot ih\"ll..rg.r, there was no need to see any of the actual features of Challenger himself; it was enough Io ..produce some sense of how his presence once affected us. . What kind of process could reproduce the effect of an imaginary presence? Although scien- tists don't yet know the fine details of how our vision-systemi *oit, we can assume lhat they involve a number of levels, perhaps like this: -- First, rays of light excite sensors in our retinas. --- Then, other agents detect boundaries and textures. ---- Then, yet other agents describe regions, shapes, and forms. ----- Then, some memory-frames recognize famiiiar obiects. ------ Next, we recognize structural relationships among those objects. ---- Finally, we relate these structures to functions and goals. Accordingly, it would be possible to produce illusions by operatin g at any of these levels. Most difficult of all would be to construct a \"picture-image\"'by arousin!, from inside the brain, the million lowest-level sensor-agents involved in real-wo*rld vision. Perf,aps the simplest way oi all would be to force iust the highest-level vision-agents into whichever states would result from seeing a certain scene: this would only require some suitable KJines. Let's call this a simulus- a reproduction of only the higher-level effects of a stimulus. A simulus at the very highest levels could lead a person torecollect virtually no details about a remembered object or event, yet be able to apprehend and contemplate its most significant structures and relationship, .hil. .r- periencing a sense of its presence. A simulus may have many advantages over a picture-image. Not only can it work more swiftly while using less machinery, but *\" Irn combine the parts\"of several simuli to imagine things we have never seen before-and even to imagine things that couldn't possibly exist. t70 E M O T I O N\n16.9 INFANT EMOTIONS A child forsaken, waking suddenly, Whose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove, And seeth only that it cannot see The meeting eyes of love. - G s o n c n E l r o r Some readers may be horrified at picturing a baby's mind as made up of nearly separate agencies. But we'll never understand how human natures grow without some theories for how they start. One evidence for separateness is how suddenly infants switch from smiles of con- tentment to shrieks of hunger-rage. In contrast to the complex mixtures of expressions that adults show, young children seem usually to be in one or another well-defined state of activity -contentment, hunger, sleepiness, play, affection, or whatever. Older children show less sudden mood changes, and their expressions suggest that more different things are happening at once. Our minds may thus originate as sets of relatively simple, separate need machines. But soon enough each becomes enmeshed in all the rest of our growing machinery. How should we interpret an infant's apparent single-mindedness? One explanation of those striking shifts in attitude is that one agency attains control and forcibly suppresses the rest. Another view is that many processes continue at once-but only one at a time can be ex- pressed. It would be more efficient to keep the whole array of proto-specialists at work. Then each would be more ready to assume control in case of an emergency. What would be the advantage in a mechanism that makes a baby conceal that mixture of emotions, expressing only one of them at a time? Perhaps that artificial sharpening promotes the child's welfare by making it easier for the parent to respond to whichever problem has the greatest urgency. It's hard enough to know what infants want, yet think how much harder it would be if they confronted us with complicated expressions of mixed feelingsl Those infants' very lives-and, in turn, our own lives*depend upon their expressing themselves clearly. To achieve that clarity, their agencies must be equipped with powerful cross-exclusion devices to magnify small differences that make it clear which needs come first. This leads to simple \"summaries\"-which manifest themselves as drastic changes in appearance, voice, and mood that others can interpret easily. And this is why, under circumstances in which adults merely frown, babies tend to shriek. Given that tho.se signs are clear, what forces us to respond to them? To help their offspring grow, most animals evolve two matching schemes: communication is a two-way street. On one side, babies are equipped with cries that can arouse parents far away, out of sight, or sound asleep-for along with sharpening those signs, cross-exclusion also amplifies their intensity. And on the other side, adults are made to find those signals inesistible; there must be special systems in our brains that give such messages a high priority. To what might those -baby- watching agents be connected? My guess is that they're wired to the remnants of the same proto-specialists that, when aroused, caused us as infants to cry in the first place. This leads adults to respond to babies' cries by attributing to them the same degrees of urgency that we ourselves would have to feel to make us shriek with similar intensity. This drivis the babies' caretakers to respond to their needs with urgent sympathy. E M O T I O N\n16.10 ADT'IT EMOTIONS Since emotions are few and redsons dre mdny (said the robot, Giskard), the behavior of a crowd can be more easily predicted than the behavior ofone person cdn. - I s a e c A s r r u o v What are emotions, anyway? Our culture sees this question as a deep and ancient mystery. How could the idea of society of mind contribute to what our ancestors have said? Common- sense psychology has not even reached a consensus on which emotions exist. Restlessness Curiosity Infatuation Impatience Excitement Fear Hate Anger Love Greed Gladness Enthusiasm Admiration Boredom Reverence ]ealousy Ambition Laziness Contempt Anxiety Sorrow Thirst Disgust Hunger Lust If there exists anger, what constitutes rage? How does fear relate to fright, terror, dread, dismay, and all such other awful things? How does love relate to reverence or to attachment or infatuation? Are these just various degrees of intensity and direction, or are they genuinely different entities that happen to be neighbors in an uncharted universe of affections? Are hate and love quite separate things, or, similarly, courage and cowardice-or are these merely pairs of extremes, each iust the absence of its peer? What are emotions, anyway, and what are all the other things we label moods, feelings, passions, needs, or sensibilities? We find it hard to agree on the meanings of words like these, presumably because few of them actually correspond to clearly distinct mental processes. Instead, when we learn such words, we each attach to them variously different and personal accumulations of conceptions in our minds. Infants'early emotion signs clearly signify their needs. We later learn to use such signals in more exploitative ways. Thus you can learn to use affection or anger as a social coin in trade for various accommodations; for example, one can pretend to be angry or pleased, or even offer -that is, threaten or promise-to become angry or affectionate in certain circumstances. Our culture is ambivalent about such matters; on one side we're taught that emotions should be natural and spontaneous; on the other side we're told that we must learn to regulate them. We recognize in deeds (though not in words) that feeling may be easier to understand and modify than other parts of intellect. We censure those who fail to learn to control their emotions but merely pity those whose problem-solving capabilities are poor; we blame for \"lack of self- control,\" but not for \"weakness of intelligence.\" Our earliest emotions are built-in processes in which inborn proto-specialists control what happens in our brains. Soon we learn to overrule those schemes, as our surroundings teach us what we ought to feel. Parents, teachers, friends, and finally our self-ideals impose upon us new rules for how to use the remnants of those early states: they teach us how and when to feel and show each kind of emotion sign. By the time we're adults, these systems have become too complicated to understand. By the time we've passed through all those stages of development, our grown-up minds have been rebuilt too many times to remember or understand much of how it felt to be an infant. E M O T I O N 172\nCHAPTER 1 7 DEVETOPMENT To the child, Nature gives various medns of rectifying dny mistakes he may commit respecting the salutary or hurtful qualities of the obiects which sunound him. On etery occasion his iudgments are conected by experience; want and pain are the necessary consequences arising from false iudgment; gratification and pleasure are produced by iudging aright. Under such masters, we cannot fail but to become well informed; and we soon learn to reason iustly, when want and pain are the necessary consequences of a contrary conduct. In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the false iudgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare; and we are not forced by any physical necessity to conect them. lmagination, on the contrary, which is eyer wandering beyond the bounds of truth, ioined to self-Iotte and that self-confidence we dre so apt to indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions that are not immediately derived from facts. . . . Levorsrsn\nI7.I SEOUENCES OF TEACHING.SETVES Up to this point we've portrayed the mind as made of scattered fragments of machinery. But we adults rarely see ourselves that way; we have more sense of unity. In the next few sections we'll speculate that this coherency is acquired over many \"stages of development. \" Each new stage first works under the guidance of previous stages, to acquire some knowledge, values, and goals. Then it proceeds to change its role and becomes a teacher to subsequent stages. APPARENr SPUBTS OF GROWTH Overlapptng Sfages of Development How could an early stage teach anything to a later one when it knows less than its student does? As every teacher knows, this is not as hard as it might seem. For one thing, it is usually easier lo recognize a solution to a problem than to discover a solution; this is what we called the \"puzzle principle.\" A teacher need not know how to solve a problem to be able to reward a student for doing so or to help the student search for solutions by imparting ways to sense when progress has been made. Even better is for the teacher to impart new goals to the student. How could an early stage of development affect the goals of a later stage? One simple way would be to give each later stage some access to the goals of earlier stages; however, those early goals would then remain infantile. How could later stages develop more advanced goals? Shortly we'll see an astonishing answer: it is not necessary to formulate more advanced goals at \"higher levels\" of organization because they are likely to develop spontaneously, as subgoals of relatively simple goals. In any case, it wouldn't be safe to send the student into the world equipped with systems that have not yet been tried and tested. A safer strategy would be to keep each new stage suppressed -that is, incapable of controlling the child's actual behavior-rntil it passes tests to verify that it is at least as capable as its predecessor. This could explain some of those apparently sudden \"spurts\" in our children's development-for example, in episodes of rapid growth of language skills. That apparent speed could be illusory if it were merely the end result of longer, hidden projects carried out silently inside the mind. Returning to our sense of Self, how could so many steps and stages lead to any sense of unity? Why wouldn't they lead us, instead, to feel increasingly fraglnentary and dispersed? I suspect the secret is that after each old stage's work is done, its structure still remains available for further use. These remnants of our prior selves provide us with a powerful resource: when- ever one's present mind gets confused, it can exploit what once was used by earlier minds. Even though we weren't as smart then as we are now, we can be sure that every stage once had, in its turn, some workable ways to manage things. One's present personality cannot share many of the thoughts of all one's older personalities-and yet it has some sense that they exist. This is one redson why we feel that we possess an inner Self-a sort of erer-Present person-friend, inside the mind, whom we cdn always ask for help. t74 D E V E L O P M E N T\nI7.2 ATTACHMENT-LEARMNG Suppose a child were playing in a certain way, and a stranger appeared and began to scold and criticize. The child would become frightened and disturbed and try to escape. But if, in the same situation, the child's parent arrived and proceeded to scold and criticize, the result would be different. Instead of being frightened, the child would feel guilty and ashamed, and instead of trying to escape, the child would try to change what it was doing, in attempts to seek reassurance and approval. I suspect that these two scenarios engage different learning mechanisms. In the encounter with the forbidding visitor, the child might learn \"/ should not try to achieve my present goal in this kind of situation \" But when scolded by someone to whom the child is \"attached,\" the child might learn \"f ought not to want to achieve that goal at all!\" In the first case, it is a matter of learning which goal to pursue in which circumstance; in the second instance, it is more a question of what goals one should have. If my theory is right, the presence of the attachment- person actually switches the effect of learning over to different sets of agents. To see the difference, let's make a small reformulation of the concept of a difference-engine to represent three different kinds of learning that an infant might use. OUTSIDE INPUTS Key fig. from p. 159 In the case of ordinary forms of failure or success signals, the learner modifies fhe methods used to reach the goal. In the case of fear-provoking disturbances, the learner may modify the description of the situation itself. In the case of attachment-related failure or reward which goals are considered worthy of pursuit. --+ -|> -+ -4 So far as I know, this is a new theory about attachment. It types of learning that can proceed only in the presence of the one has become attached. the learner modifies asserts that there are particular particular individuals to whom AGEilTF DESCRIPTIONS OF SITUATIONS alters which subagents are selected. DESCRIPTIONS OF GOALS ATTACHMENT D E V E I O P M E N T\n17.3 ATTACHMENT SIMPIJFIES No form of behavior is accompanied by stronger feeling than is attachment behavior. The figures towards whom it is directed are Ioved and their advent is treated with ioy. So long as a child is in the unchallenged presence of a principal attachment-figure, or within easy reach, he feels secure. A threat of loss creates anxiety, and actual loss, sonow; both, moreoyer, are likely to arouse dnger. - J o u N B o w L s y Most higher animals have evolved instinctive \"bonding\" mechanisms that keep the young- sters close to the parents. Human infants, too, are born with tendencies to form special attach- ments; all parents know their powerful effects. Early in life, most children become attached to one or a few family members or caretakers, sometimes so firmly that for several years such children may never stray more than a few meters from the attachment-figure. During those years, a prolonged separation of the child from those particular persons may be followed by an enduring depression or disturbance, during which the child's personality does not develop normally. What is the function of childhood attachment? The simplest explanation is that it evolved to keep children within a safe sphere of nurture and protection. But according to our theory, our human bond machinery has the additional function of forcing children to acquire values, goals, and ideals from particular older individuals. Why is this so important? Because even though there are many ways a child could learn about ordinary causes and effects, there is no way for a child to construct a coherent system of values-except by basing it upon some already existing model. The task of constructing a \"civilized personality\" must be far beyond the inventive power of any single individual. Furthermore, if too wide a variety of adult models were avail- able, it would be too hard to build a coherent personality of one's own, because one would have to pick and choose fragments from all those different personalities-and this might lead to so many conflicts and inconsistencies that many of them would cancel each other out. It would simplify the child's task if the attachment mechanism restricted attention to only a few role models. How did our attachment-bonds evolve? In many species of animals, attachment occurs so swiftly and firmly that scientists who study animal behavior call it \"imprinting.\" Presumably, the machinery that makes us learn our parents' goals is descended from the mechanisms of our animal ancestors. Presumably our infantile attachment-bonds form as soon as various inborn systems learn to distinguish the parents' individual peculiarities-first by senses of touch, taste, and smell; then by sound of voice and, finally, by sight of face. Once those attachment-bonds are formed, a child won't react in the same way to the faces and voices of strangers and parents, for these have different effects on how we learn. The effect of an attachment-person's affection or rejection is not like that of ordinary \"success-failure\" goal-rewards-which merely teach us what to do in order to achieve our goals. Attachment- related signals seem to work directly on those goals themselves-and thus can modify our personalities. Attachments teach us ends, not means-and thus impose on us our parents' dreams. D E V E L O P M E N T\n17.4 FUNCTIONAI.ATITONOMY We've talked about some ways to learn goals from other people. But how do we come to make goals for ourselves? It seems simple enough always to move from goal to subgoal-but how ciuld one go the other way, moving outward to find new kinds of goals? Our answer may seem strange atkrst: there is a sense in which we never really need to invent new \"high-level\" goals at aill ttris is because, in principle, at least, it is enough to keep inventing lowerJevel iubgoals for problems that we have to solvel Here is why this need not limit our ambitions: Functional Autonomy. In the course of pursuing any sufficiently complicated problem, the subgoals that engage our attentions cdn become both increasingly 'more ambitious and increasingly detached from the original problem. Suppose a baby's initial goal was to reach a certain cup. This could lead to the subgoal of lrarnirrg how to move the arm and hand efficientlv, which, in turn, could lead to sub-subgoals of learriing to move around obstacles. And this could keep growing into increasingly general and abstra\"ct goals of learning how to understand and manage the physical world of space and time. Thus one can begin with a lowly goal, yet end up with some sub-subgoals that lead our minds into the most ambitious enterprises we can conceive. This can also happen in the social realm. The same baby can form, instead, the subgoal of engaging another p..rort\" help in bringing it that drinking cup. This can lead to trying to find r\"-. efiective ways to influence that other person-and thus the child could become con- cerned with representing and predicting the motives and dispositions of other people. Again, a relatively mod-est drinking goil \"\".r lead to a larger competence*this time in the realm of comprehending social interactions. An initially simple concern with personal comfort becomes transformed into a more ambitious, less self-centered enterprise. Yirtually any problem wilt be edsier to solve the more one learns about the context world in which that problem occurs. No matter what one's problem is, provided that it's hard enough, one always gains from learning better ways to learn. Many of us like to believe that our intellectual enterprises lie on higher planes than our everyday activities. But now we can turn that academic value-scheme upon its head. When we get iighi down to it, our most abstract investigations can be seen as having origins in finding t.\"r,i to ordinary ends. These turn into what we regard as noble qualities when they gain enough functional autonomy to put their roots aside. In the end, our initial goals matter ,\"\"t..]y at all, because no matter what our original obiectives, we can gain more by becoming better able to predict and control our world. It may not even matter whether an infant was initially inclined to emulate or to oppose a parent, or was first moved primarily by fear or by affection. The implements of accomplishment are much the same in either case. Knowledge is power. Whatever one's goals, they will be easier to achieve if one can become wise, wealthy, and powerful. And these in turn can best be gained by understanding how things work. D E V E L O P M E N T\nI7.5 DEVETOPMENTAI, STAGES On the surface, the theories of fean Piaget and Sigmund Freud might seem to lie in different scientific universes. Piaget seems to be concerned almost wholly withintellectual matters, while Freud studies emotional mechanisms. Yet the differen..r ri. not really clear. It is widely understood that emotional behavior depends on unconscious machirr.ry, b,rt we do not so often recognize that ordinary \"intellectual\" thinking also depends on mechanisms that are equally hidden from introspection. In any case, despite their differences, both these great psychologists asserted that every child proceeds through \"stages\" of mental development. And iurely .uiry p\"rr.rt notices how chil- dren sometimes seem to stay the same but at other times appear to change more rapidly. Rather than review particular theories of how children progress thiough stages, Iet's look ai the concept of \"stage\" itself. Why can't t^)e grow by steady, smooth development? I'll argue that nothing so complex as a human mind can grow, except in separate steps. One reason is that it is always dangerous to change a system that alreidy works. Suppose you discover a new idea or way to think that seems useful enough to justify building more skills that depend on it. What happens if, later, it should turn out that this idea has r ,.rio,r, flaw? How could you restore your previous abilities? One way might be to maintain such complete records that you could \"undo\" all the changes that were made-but that wouldn't work if those changes had already made your quality of thought so poor that you couldn't recognize how poor it h;d become. A safer way would be to keep some older versions of your previous mind intact as you constructed each new version. Then you could \"regress\" to a previous stage in case the new one failed, and you could also use it to evaluate the performance of the new stage. Another conservative strategy is never to let a new stage take control of actual behavior until there is evidence that it can outperform its predecessor. What would an outside observer see if a child employed this strategy? One would observe only \"plateaus,\" during which there were few apparent changes in behavior, followed by \"spurts oi growth\" in which new capacities emerge suddenly. Yet that appearance would be illusory, since the actual times of development would occur within those silent periods. This scheme has the great advantage of permitting the child to continue to function during mental growth and, thus, maintain \"business during renovations.\" Each working version can hold still while new ones safely move ahead This applies to every large organization, not only to those involved in a child's development. Given a community that is already functioning, it is always dangerous to make more than a few changes at once. Each change is prone to have some harmful side effects on other systems that depend on it. Some of those side effects may not become apparent until so many of them have accumulated that the system has deteriorated past any point of turning back. Accordingly, it is better to stop from time to time to make inspections and repairs. The same is true for learning any complex skill; unless your goal is held unchanged for long enough, you won't have timi enough to learn the skills required to accomplish it. It simply isn't practical to make minds grow by steady, smooth development. 178 D E V E T O P M E N T\nT7.6 PRERESUISITES FOR GROWTH What controls the pace of mental growth? Although some aspects of development depend on external circumstances a.rd others ieem to happen only by chance, certain aspects of our growth seem almost to proceed relentlessly from stage to stage, as though those stages were ii.Jerti\".d. This brings us back to asking why development proceeds in stages at all. One reason a skill -\"\"y grorv in steps isihatit needs \"prerequisites.\" You cannot start to build a house by placing its roJf on top; f,rst you have to build some walls. That's not an arbitrary rule; it's inhlrent in the enterprise. It is the same for mental skills; some processes cannot be learned until certain other pro\".rr., become available. Many of Piagefs theories were based o\" ttir suspicion that certain concepts had prerequisites. For example, he argued that a child must possess ideas about which operationi are reversible before that child can grow good \"o\"\"\"ptr about how quantities are conserved. Hypotheses like these led Piaget to do his great experiments. But consider how easily those experiments could have been done a thousand fears b.fore; the only equipment they required were children, water, and various iars. Were Piaget's ideas prerequisites for conceiving those experiments? - fo b\"ild a iood 'society-of-More, it simply would not be practical for a child to introduce those middle-Lvel agents'Appearance and History until some lowerlevel agents such as Tall, ihir,No Loss, and fleversibtehadbecome available. Before that stage, there would be nothing for those managers to do! To be sure, that isn't strictly true, just as one could start to construct a house with a roof, by using temporary scaffolding and later building the house's sides. We can never be absolutely sure of *hrt a skill's prerequisites must be-and this will always com- plicate psychology. The i\"\"ror, *. k.ro* so little about how children's minds grow is that we can't observe the processes that are responsible. It could take several years to refine a new agency, and during ihrt ti-\", the child's -behavior will be dominated by other processes in other agencies, which are themselves growing through their own, overlapping stages of development. A serious prob- lem for the psyJhologiit is thit certain types of mental growth can never be directly observed at all. This \"pililr, in particular, to those all-important \"B-brain\" processes with which we learn new ways [o l.arr,. dnly the indirect products of this ever appear in the child's actual behavior, and even these may not become overt until long after that higher-level growth has occurred. perhaps most difficult of all is detecting the development of suppressors and censors. See 27.2. It is hard enough to analyze what people do, but it is almost impossible to recognize the things they never do. To make matters worse, many of the \"stages of development\" that we actually observe do not really exist. From time to time, each parent has the illusion that a child has suddenly changed, when this is only the result of not observing several smaller, real changes in the past' In such a case, if there exists a \"stage of growth,\" it is inside the parent's mind, and not in the child at all! D E V E L O P M E N T t79\n17.7 GENETIC TIMETABLES When we first introduced Papert's principle-that is, the idea of growing by inserting new levels of management into old agencies-we did not ask when rr.*i\"y.., ihouft be built. If managers are inserted too soon, when their workers are still immature, iittle will get done. And if those managers come too late, that, too, would delay the mental growth. Whai could ensure that managers are not engaged too late or too soon? We all know \"hild.\"n who seem to have matured too quickly or too slowly, in various respects, to match other areas of their growth. In an ideal system, each developing agency would be controlled by another agency equipped to introduce new agents iust when they're needed-that is, when enough ftis UeL\" learned to iustify the start of another stage, In any case, it would surely be disastious if all our potential capacity to learn became available too soon. If every agent could learn from birth, they'd all be overwhelmed by infantile ideas. One way to regulate such things would be to actuate new agencies at genetically predeter- mined times. At various stages of biological \"maturity,\" certiin classes\"of agents would be enabled to establish new connections, while others would be forced to slow t\"heir growth by making permanent connections that, till then, had been reversible. Could \"ny ilo.k*orl scheme like this be guaranteed to work? Consider the fact that most of our children acquire agents like Reverslble andConfined before they are five years old. For fhose children, at least, it would suffice to activate new intermediatelevel agents at that age, so those children could proceed to build agents like Appearance andHistory. However, children who weren't ready yet would then be slightly handicapped by being forced to build some less-than-usually effectiue Societies-of-More' Nor would that rigid maturation-scheme serve well those children who had already moved \"ahead of schedule.\" It would be better to have systems in which the timing of each stage depends on what has actually happened earlier. One way a stagelike episode might start could stem from what we called the tnvestment principle: once a certain skill surpasses all its close competitors, it becomes increasingly likely to be employed-and thereby increases its opportunitiis to develop even further. This self- enhancing effect can cause a spurt of rapid progress in which a particular skill quickly comes to dominate the scene. One way a stagelike episode might end could stem from'what we called the exc_eption principle. To see how this could happen, suppose that a certain agency develops so useful a way to do some iob that many other agencies soon learn to exploit lhat capability. The more those other agencies become dependent on that skill, the -o.. dirr.rption will result from every further \"improvement\" in it-since it now has more customers to please! Even increasing the speed of one process could damage other agencies that depend ,rpon hor\" long it takes to work. Thus, once a scheme persists for long enough, it gets to be exiremely hardto change-not because of limitations inherent in itself or in the ognrry that developid it, but because of how the rest of the society depends upon its present form. Once it becomes too hard to change an old agency, it is time to build another one; further progress may require revolution rather than evolution. This is another reason why a complex system must be grown in a sequence of separate steps. I80 D E V E L O P M E N T\nI7.8 ATTACHMENT.IMAGES Guilt is the gift that keeps on git,ing. - J n w r s H P R o v E R B All people talk of goals and dreams, of personal priorities, of goods and bads, rights and wrongs, virtues and depravities. What makes our ethics and ideals develop in our children's minds? In one of the theories of Sigmund Freud, an infant becomes enamored of one or both parents, and somehow this leads the baby into absorbing or, as Freud put it, \"introiecting\" the goals and values of those love-objects. Thenceforth, throughout later life, those parent-images persist inside the grown-up child's mind, to influence whatever thoughts and goals are con- sidered worthy of pursuit. We are not compelled to agree with all of Freud's account, but we have to explain why children develop models of their parents' values at all. So far as the child's safety is concerned, it would suffice for attachment to keep the child in the parents'physical vicinity. What could be the biological and psychological functions of developing complicated self-ideals? The answer seems quite clear to me. Consider that our models of ourselves are so complex that even adults can't explain them. How could a fragmentary infant mind know enough to build such a complicated thing-without some model upon which to base it? We aren't born with built-in Selves-but most of us are fortunate enough to be born with human caretakers. Then, our attachment mechanisms force us to focus on our parents'ways, and this leads us to build crude images of what those parents themselves are like. That way, the values and goals of a culture pass from one generation to the next. They are not learned the way skills are learned. We learn our earliest values under the influence of attachment-related signals that represent, not our own success or failure, but our parents' love or rejection. When we maintain our standards, we feel virtuous rather than merely successful. When we violate those standards, we feel shame and guilt rather than mere disappointment. This is not just a matter of words: those things are not the same; it is like the difference between ends and means. How could coherence be imposed upon a multitude of mindless agencies? Freud may have been the first to see that this could emerge from the effects of infant attachment. It was several more decades before psychologists recognized that separating children from their attachments can have devastating effects on the growth of their personalities. Freud also observed that children frequently reject one parent in favor of the other, in a process that suggests the cross- exclusiveness of sexual jealousy; he called this the Oedipus complex. It seems plausible that something of this sort ought to happen regardless of any connection between attachment and sexuality. If a developing identity is based upon that of another person, it must become confus- ing to be attached to two dissimilar adult \"models.\" This might lead a child to try to simplify the situation by rejecting or removing one of them from the scene. Many people dislike the thought of being dominated from within by the image of a parent's wish. Yet, in exchange, that slavery is just what makes us relatively free (as compared with other animals) from being forced to obey so many other kinds of unlearned, built-in instinct- soals. D E V E L O P M E N T\n17.9 DIFFERENT SPANS OF MEMORIES Everyone can master a grief but he who has it. - W r l l l a n r S n a r e s p p e n n Consider the plight of a mother with a new infant. Her baby will demand her time for many years. Sometimes she must wonder, \"How does this baby iustify such sacrifice?\" Various \"nr*.r, come to mind: \"Becduse I love it.\" \"Becdltse someday it wilt care for me.\" \"Becduse it's here to cdrry on our line.\" But reasoning rarely brings answers to such questions. Usually, those ques- tions simply fade away as parents continue to nurture their children as though they were parts of their own bodies. Sometimes, though, strains may overwhelm the mechanismr ihrt protect each child from harm, and this results in tragedies. These complex parent-to-child and child-to-parent bonds must be based on certain types of memory. Some memories are less changeable than others, and I suspect that attachment-bonds involve memory-records of a type that can be rapidly formed but then become peculiarly slow to change. On the child's side, perhaps these bonds are descended from the forms of learning called \"imprinting,\" with which many kinds of infant animals quickly learn to recognize theii parents. On the parents' side, the adult animals of many species will reject infants not involved in bonding shortly after birth; then foster-parenting becomes impossible. Why should bonding memories be so hard to change? In animals, there usually are evolutionary disadvantages to raising the offspring of unrelated individuals. Human infants must develop under the addiiional constraint of requiring constant adult models as a basis for their personalities. Similar goal- affecting bonds could explain the often irresistible force of \"peer pressure\" in later life. Perhaps all such attachment-bonds exploit the same machinery. Many animals form other kinds of social bonds as well, like those in which an individual selects a mate and then remains attached to it for life. Many people do this, too, and a number of the ones who don't have been observed to select, instead, from among alternatives of seem- ingly similar appearance or character-as though those persons were attached, if not to individ- uals, to certain constant prototypes. Other people frequently find themselves enslaved by infatuations that some parts of their minds find unwelcome but cannot prevent or overcome; once formed, those memory-bonds will only slowly fade away. The time spans of our different sorts of memories evolved to suit, not our own needs, but those of our ancestors. We all know the seemingly inexorable time span of mourning, in which it often takes so long to accept the loss of those we love. Perhaps this, too, reflects the slowness of attachment- change, though it is only one factor. This could also be partially responsible for the prolonged psychological disability that can follow the experience of a physical, emotional, or sexual assault upon a person. One might ask, since there are so many other devastating aspects of such an experience, why it should involve any connection with attachment memory. I suspect that any form of intimacy, however unwelcome, has effects upon machinery shared by both attachment and sexuality, and is liable to disturb or disrupt the machinery with which we make relationships in ordinary life. No matter how brief that violent episode, it may lead to long derangements in our usual relationships, in part because those agencies are slow to change. It doesn't help very much for the victim to try to view the situation neutrally, because the rest of the mind cannot control those agencies; only time can reconstruct their normal functioning. It is an injury more terrible than loss of sight or limb, to lose the normal use of the asencies with which one builds one's own identity. D E V E L O P M E N T\n1 7. IO INTETLECTUAT TRAUMA One of Freud's conceptions was that the growth of manv individuals is shaped by unsus- pected fears that lurk in our unconscious minds. These powerful anxieties include the dread of punishment or injury or helplessness or, worst of all, the loss of the esteem of those to whom we are attached. Whether this is true or not, most psychologists who hold this view apply it only to the social realm, assuming that the world of intellect is too straightforward and imper- sonal to be involved with such feelings. But intellectual development can depend equally upon attachments to other persons and can be similarly involved with buried fears and dreads. Later, when we discuss the nature of humor and jokes, we'll see that many of the conse- quences of both social and intellectual failures are rather similar. A major difference is that in the social world, only other persons can inform us about our violations of taboos-whereas within the realm of intellect, we can often detect our own deficiencies. A tower-building child needs no teacher to complain when a misplaced block spoils all the work. Nor does a thinking child's mind need anyone to tell it when some paradox engulfs and whirls it into a frightening cyclone. By itself, the failure to achieve a goal can cause anxiety. For example, surely every child must once have thought along this line: Hmmm. Ten is nearly eleven. And eleven is nearly twelye. So ten is nearly twelye. And so on. If I keep on reasoning this way, then ten must be nearly a hundred! To an adult, this is iust a stupid joke. But earlier in life, such an incident could have produced a crisis of self-confidence and helplessness. To put it in more grown-up terms, the child might think, I can't see anything wrong with my reasoning-and yet it led to bad results. I merely uied the obvious fact that if A is near B, and B is near C, then A must be near C. I see no way that could be wrong-so there must be something wrong with my mind. Whether or not we can recollect it, we must once have felt some distress at being made to sketch the nonexistent boundaries between the oceans and the seas. What was it like to first consider \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\" What came before the start of time; what lies beyond the edge of space? And what of sentences like \"This statement is false,\" which can throw the mind into a spin? I don't know anyone who recalls such incidents as frightening. But then, as Freud might say, this very fact could be a hint that the area is subject to censorship. If people bear the scars of scary thoughts, why don't these lead, as our emotion-rraumas are supposed to do, to phobias, compulsions, and the like? I suspect the answer is that they do- but disguised in forms we don't perceive as pathological. Every teacher knows and loathes how certain children turn away from learning things they believe they cannot learn: \"I simply can't. I'm iust no good at that.\" Sometimes this might represent only a learned way to avoid the shame and stress that came from social censure of failures in the past. But it might equally represent a reaction to the nonsocial stress that came frorn having been unable to deal with certain ideas themselves. Today, we generally regard emotional incompetence as an illness to be remedied. However, we generally accept incompetence of intellect as a normal, if unfortu- nate, deficiency in \"talents,\" \"aptitudes,\" and \"gifts.\" Accordingly, we say things like \"That child isn't ttery bright,\" as though that person's poverty of thought were part of iome predes- tined fate-and, therefore, isn't anyone's fault. D E V E L O P M E N T\nI7.I I INTEITECT'TIAI IDEATS If the mind were dn ego-personality, it could do this and that as it would determine, but the mind often flies from what it knows is right and chases after evil reluctantly. Still, nothing seems to happen exactly as its ego desires. It is simply the mind clouded over by impure desires, and impenious to wisdom, which stubbornly persists in thinking of \"me\" dnd\"mine.\" - B u o o H a How do we deal with thoughts that lead to frightening results? What should one think about the \"nearly\" paradox that threatens to imply that all things, large and small, might be the same size? One strategy would be to constrain that kind of reasoning, by learning never to chain together more than two or three such nedrness links. Then, perhaps, one might proceed to generalize that strategy, in fear that it's unsafe to chain together too many instances of any form of inference. But what could the phrase \"too mdny\" mean? There is no universal answer. Iust as in the case of More, we have to learn this separately in each important realm of thought: what are the limitations of each type and style of reasoning? Human thought is not based on any single and uniform kind of \"logic,\" but upon myriad processes, scripts, stereotypes, critics and censors, analogies and metaphors. Some are acquired through the operation of our genes, others are learned from our environments, and yet others we construct for ourselves. But even inside the mind, no one really learns alone, since every step employs many things we've learned before, from language, family, and friends-as well as from our former Selves. Without each stage to teach the next, no one could construct anything as complex as a mind. There is another way our intellectual growth is not so different from our emotional develop- ment: we can make intellectual attachments, too, and want to think the way certain other persons do. These intellectual ideals may stem from parents, teachers, and friends; from per- sons one has never met, such as writers; even from legendary heroes who did not exist. I suspect we depend as much on images of how we ought to think as we do on images of how we ought to feel. Some of our most persistent memories are about certain teachers, but not about what was taught. (At the moment I'rr writing this, I feel as though my hero Warren McCulloch were watching disapprovingly; he would not have liked these neo-Freudian ideas.) No matter how emotionally neutral an enterprise may seem, there's no such thing as being \"purely rational.\" One must always approach each situation with somu personal style and disposition. Even scientists have to make stylistic choices: Is there enough eyidence yet, or should I seek more? ls it time to make a uniframe-or should I accumulate more examples? Can I rely on older theories here, or should I trust my latest guess? Should I try to be Reductionist or Novelisf ? At every step, the choices we make depend on what we have become. Our sciences, arts, and moral skills do not originate from detached ideals of truth, beauty, or virtue but stem partly from our endeavors to placate or please the images established in earlier years. Our adult dispositions thus evolve from impulses so infantile that we would surely censure them, if they were not by now transformed, disguised, or-as Freud said-\"sublimated. \" r84 D E V E L O P M E N T\ncHArrEn 1 E REASONING Machines-with their inefutable logic, their cold preciseness of figures, their tireless, utterly exact obsertations, theit obsolute knowledge of mathematics-they could elaborate any idea, however simple its beginning, and reach the conclusion. Machines had imagination of the ideal sort-the ability to construct d necessdry future from a present fact. But Man had imagination of a different kind; the illogical, brilliant imagination that sees the future result vaguely, without knowing the why, nor the how; an imagination that outstrips the machine in its preciseness. Man might reach the conclusion more swiftly, but the machine always reached it eventually, and always the right conclusion. By leaps and bounds mdn advanced. By steady, irresistible steps the machine marched forward. - J o s N W . C A M P B E L L , ) R .\nI8.I MUST MACHINES BE LOGICAT? What's wrong with the old arguments that lead us to believe that if machines could ever think at all, they'd have to think with perfect logic? We're told that by their nature, all machines must work according to rules. We're also told that they can only do exactly what they're told to do. Besides that, we also hear that machines can only handle quantities and therefore cannot deal with qualities or anything like analogies. Most such arguments are based upon a mistake that is like confusing an agent with an agency. When we design and build a machine, we know a good deal about how it works. When our design is based on neat, logical principles, we are likely to make the mistake of expecting the machine to behave in a similarly neat and logical fashion. But that confuses what the machine does inside itself-that is, how i1 \"y,'e1[s\"-with our expectations of how it will appear to behave in the outer world. Being able to explain in logical terms how a machine's parts work does not automatically enable us to explain its subsequent activities in simple, logical terms. Edgar Allan Poe once argued that a certain chess-playing \"machine\" had to be fraudulent because it did not always win. If it were really a machine, he argued, it would be perfectly logical-and therefore could never make any mistakes!What is the fallacy in this? Simply that there is nothing to prevent us from using logical language to describe illogical reasoning. To a certain extent it's true that machines can do only what they are designed to do. But this does not preclude us, when once we know how thinking works, from designing machines that think. When do we actually use logic in real life? We use it to simplify and summarize our thoughts. We use it to explain arguments to other people and to persuade them that those arguments are right. We use it to reformulate our own ideas. But I doubt that we often use logic actually to solve problems or to \"get\" new ideas. Instead, we formulate our arguments and conclusions in logical terms after we have constructed or discovered them in other ways; only then do we use verbal and other kinds of formal reasoning to \"clean things up,\" to separate the essential parts frorn the spaghettilike tangles of thoughts and ideas in which they first occurred. To see why logic must come afterward, recall the idea of solving problems by using the generate and test method. In any such process, logic can be only a fraction of the reasoning; it can serve as a test to keep us from coming to invalid conclusions, but it cannot tell us which ideas to generate, or which processes and memories to use. Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how we speak; both can tell us whether our sentences are properly formed, but they cannot tell us which sentences to make. Without an intimate connection between our knowledge and our intentions, logic leads to madness, not intelligence. A logical system without a goal will merely generate an endless host of pointless truths like these: A implies A. P or not P. A imPlies A or A or A. If4 is 5, then pigs can fly. R E A S O N I N G\n18.2 CITAINS OF REASONING Here's a rule that's part of ordinary common sense: If A depends on B, and B depends on C, then-clearly-A depends on C. But what do such expressions mean? And why do we make the same kinds of inferences not only for dependency but also for implication and causality? If A depends on B, and, also, B depends on C, then A depends on C. lf A implies B, and, also, B implies C, then A implies C. lf A causes B, and, also, B cduses C, then A causes C. What do all these different ideas have in common? All lend themselves to being linked into chainlike strings. Whenever we discover such sequences-however long they may be-we regard it as completely natural to compress them into single links, by deleting ail but the beginning and the end. This lets us \"conclude,\" for example, that A depends oi, implies, or causes C. We do this even with imaginary paths through time and space. Floor holds Table holds Saucer holds Cup holds Tea Wheel turns Shaft turns Gear turns Shaft turns Gear Sometimes we even chain together different kinds of links: House walk to Garage drive to Airport fly fo Airport Owls are Birds, and Birds can Fly. So, Owls can Fly. The chain containing \"walk,\" \"drive,\" and \"fly\" may appear to use several different kinds of links. But although they differ in regard to vehicles, they all refer to paths through space. And in the Owl-Bird example, \"are\" and \"can\" seem more different at first, but we can translate them both into a more uniform language by changing \"Owls are Birds\" into \"An Owl ls a Typical-Bird\" and \"Birds can Fly\" into \"A Typical-Bird is a thing-which-can-Fly.\" Both sen- tences then share the same type of \"ls d\" link, and this allows us to chain them together more easily. For generations, scientists and philosophers have tried to explain ordinary reasoning in terms of logical principles-with virtually no success. I suspect this enterprise failed because it was lo_oking in the wrong direction: common sense works so well not because it is an approximation of logic; logic i5 only a small part of our great accumulation of different, useful ways to chain things together. Many thinkers have assumed that logical necessity lies at the heart of our reasoning. But for the purposes of psychology, we'd do better to set aside the dubious ideal of faultless deduction and try, instead, to understand how people actually deal with what is usual or typical To do this, we often think in terms of causes, similarities, and dependencies. What do all these forms of thinking share? They all use different ways to make chains. R E A S O N I N G\nI8.3 CIINNING Why is chaining so important? Because, as we've just seen, it seems to work in many different realms. More than that, it can also work in several ways at once, inside the same world. Consider how, with no apparent mental strain at all, we can first imagine the same kind of arch to be a bridge, a tunnel, or a table-and then we can imagine chains of these, according to quite different views: Chaining seems to permeate not only how we reason, but how we think of structures in space and time. We find ourselves involved with chains whenever we imagine or explain. Why does the ability to build mental chains help us solve so many different kinds of problems? Perhaps because all sorts of chains share common properties like these: When chains are stressed, the weakest links break first. To fix a brcken chain, one needs to repair only its broken links. No part of o chain con be removed if both ends rcmain fixed. If pulting A makes B mote, there must be a chain connecting A and B. Each separate rule seems common sense, at least when we apply it to a solid thing like a bridge, a flnce, or a physical chain. But why do chains apply so well to insubstantial \"lines of thought\"? It is because there's such a good analogy between how chains can break and how reasoning can fail. f ftrf, TABLE .rv TUNNEL I 8 8 R E A S O N I N G\nI8.4 LOGICAT CIINNS \"Logic\" is the word we use for certain ways to chain ideas. But I doubt that pure deductive logic plays much of a role in ordinary thinking. Here is one way to contrast logical reasoning and ordinary thinking. Both build chainlike connections between ideas. The difference is that in logic there's no middle ground; a logic link is either there or not. Because of this, a logical argument cannot have any \"weakest link.\" Commonsense Reasoning Mathematical Logic Logic demands just one support for every link, a single, flawless deduction. Common sense asks, at every step, if all of what we've found so far is in accord with everyday experience. No sensible person ever trusts a long, thin chain of reasoning. In real life, when we listen to an argument, we do not merely check each separate step; we look to see if what has been described so far seems plausible. We look for other evidence beyond the reasons in that argument. Consider how often we speak of reasoning in terms of structural or architectural expressions, as though our arguments were like the towers Builder builds: \"Your argument is based on weak evidence.\" \"You must support that with more evidence.\" \"That argument is shaky.It will collapse.\" In this way, commonsense reasoning differs from \"logical\" reasoning. When an ordinary argument seems weak, we may be able io support it with more evidence. But there is no way for a link inside a logic chain to use additional support; if it's not quite right, then it's absolutely wrong. Indeed, this weakness is actually the source of logic's own peculiar strength, because the less we bose our conclusions on, the fewer possibilities con exist for weoknesses in our arguments! This strategy serves mathematics well-but it doesn't help us much in dealing with uncertainties. We cannot afford to stake our lives on chains that fall apart so easily. I do not mean to say that there is anything wrong with logic; I only object to the assumption that ordinary reasoning is largely based on it. What, then, are the functions of logic? It rarely helps us get a new idea, but it often helps us to detect the weaknesses in old ideas. Sometimes it also helps us clarify our thoughts by refining messy networks into simpler chains. Thus, once we find a way to solve a certain problem, logical analysis can help us find the most essential steps. Then it becomes easier to explain what we've discovered to other people-and, also, we often benefit from explaining our ideas to ourselves. This is because, more often than not, instead of explaining what we actually did, we come up with a new formulation. Paradoxically, the moments in which we think we're being logical and methodical can be just the times at which we're most creative and original. R E A S O N I N G r89\nI8.5 STRONG ARGI'MENTS When people disagree, we often say that one side's position seems \"stronger\" than the other. But what has \"strength\" to do with reasoning? In logic, arguments are simply either right or wrong, since there is not the slightest room for matters of degree. But in real life, few arguments are ever absolutely sure, so we simply have to learn how various forms of reasoning are likely to go wrong. Then we can use different methods to make our chains of reasoning harder to break. One method is to use several different arguments to prove the same point-putting them \"in parallel.\" By analogy, when you park a car on a steep hill, it isn't safe to depend on brakes alone. No brake can work unless all its parts do-and, unhappily, all those parts form a long and slender chain no stronger than its weakest link. -- Driver's foot presses on brake bedal. -- Brake pedal forces piston into master cylinder. -- This forces brake fluid to flow from cylinder. ---- Brake fluid flows through tubes to brakes at wheels. ---- Pistons in brake cylinders apply force to brake shoes. ---- Brake shoes press on wheel drums, stopping wheels. An expert driver also leaves the car in gear and turns the wheels into the curb. Then, though no one of these tricks is perfectly secure, the combination cannot fail unless three things go wrong at once. This whole is stronger than any of its parts. A @ B BRAKES B GEAR CURB CHAIN A chain can break with any single injury, but a parallel bundle cannot fail unless every one of its links has been broken. Our car can't roll away unless all three-brake, wheel, and parking gear-go wrong at once. Parallel bundles and serial chains are only the simplest ways to link together various parts. Here are some others. Each serial connection makes stronger. a structure weaker, while each parallel connection makes it CHAIN OF BUNDLES 190 N E A S O N I N G\n18.6 MAGNITUDE FROM MT'ITITUDE We like to think of reasoning as rational-yet we often represent our arguments as fights between adversaries positioned to determine which can wield the greater Jrength o, foi.\". Why do we use such energetic and aggressive images of weakness, strength, defeat, and victory, of boxing in and breaking down an enemy's defense? Why don't we just use cool, clear, faultlesi reasoning to prove we are right? The answer is that we rarely need to know that anvthing is absolutely wrong or right; instead, we only want to choose the best of some alternatives. Here are two different strategies for deciding whether one group of reasons should be con- sidered \"stronger\" than another. The first strategy tries to compare opposing arguments in terms of magnitudes, by analogy to how two physical forces interact: Strength from Magnitude: When two forces work together, they add. to form a single larger force. But when two forces oppose each other directly, their strenEths subtract. Our second strategy is simply to count how many different reasons you can find for choosing each alternative: Strength from Multitude: The more redsons we cdn find in favor of a particular decision, the more confidence we cdn have in it. This is because if som.e of those redsons turn out to be wrong, other redsons may still remain. _ Whichever strategy we use, we tend to speak of the winning argument as the \"stronger\" one. But why do we use the same word \"strong\" for two such difFerent strategies? It is because we use them both for the same purpose: to rcduce the tikelihood of failure. Ilcomes out the same in the end, whether we base a decision on a single \"strong\" argument*that is, one unlikely to be wrong-or on several weaker arguments, in hopes thaithey won't fail all at once. What makes us so prone to formulate our reasoning in teims of conflicting adversaries? It m r-st be partly cultural, but some of it could also be based on inheritan..l Wh\".r we use architectural metaphor_s that speak of arguments as not supported properly, we could be exploit- ing structures that evolved within our spatial agencies. Similarly, *h.n *. represent our rea- soning in terms of battling adversaries, we might be exploiting the use of agencies that first evolved for physical defense. R E A S O N I N G\nIE.7 WHAT IS A NUMBER? Why do we find it so hard to explain the meanings of things? Because what something \"means\" depends upon each different person's state of mind. If so, you might suspect that nothing means exactly the same thing to any hvo different persons. But if that were the case, where could you start? If every meaning in a person's mind depended on all the other meanings there, wouldn't everything go in circles? And if you couldn't break into those circles, wouldn't it all become too subjective to make good science? No. There is nothing wrong with phenomena in which many things depend on one another. And you don't have to be ln those circles in order to understand them; you simply have to make good theories about them. It is a pleasant dream to imagine things being defined so perfectly that different people could understand things in exactly the same ways. But that ideal can't be achieved, because in order for two minds to agree perfectly, at every level of detail, they'd have to be identical. The closest we can come to agreeing on meanings is in mathematics, when we talk of things like \"Three\" and \"Five.\" But even something as impersonal as \"Five\" never stands isolated in a person's mind but becomes part of a huge network. For example, we sometimes think of \"Five\" for counting things, as when we recite \"One, Two, Three, Four, Five\" while taking care l) to touch each thing only once, and 2) never to touch anything more than once. One way to ensure that is to pick up each thing as it's counted and remove it. Another way is to match a group of things to a certain standard set of Five-such as the fingers of your hand-or to that silent stream of syllables spoken in the mind. If, one by one, the things are matched and none are left behind, then there were Five. Another way to think of Five is to imagine some familiar shape-a pentagon, an X or V or W, a star, or even an airplane: :ii:l:iri: li.i.li.i. :l:::i:: o.i .'..ei i}:i:!: t:i!:i:ii!:ii:i:O t....,..t....,,' ,.'...C.,...i.... ::t:t: :,:t:,lt: i,l :,1 : :' . tt..t .'..' .,i:li: i: il i!:::ii:ittl:: !:i:.i: : i:i.i.:i.. 1i,.'.r,.,,.,1,..:1- r:r O:::te:;::tO :tiil :,!i i:::.ii i:ti'lf ,! That way, a child might even come to understand a larger number before a smaller one. I actually knew one child who seemed to know Six before she knew Five, because she'd played so much with sets of triangles and hexagons. Each number meaning works in different problem worlds. To ask which meaning is correct -to count, match, or put into groups-is foolishness: each method helps the others, and all of them together make a mass of skills that grow in power and efficiency. The really useful \"meanings\" are not the flimsy logic chains of definitions, but the much harder-to-express networks of ways to remember, compare, and change things. A logic chain can break easily, but you get stuck less often when you use a cross-connected meaning-network; then, when any sense of meaning fails, you simply switch to another sense. Consider, for example, how many different Twos a child knows: two hands, two feet, two shoes, two socks, and all their inter- changeabilities. As for Threes, recall the popular children's tale about three bears. The bears themselves are usually perceived as Two and One-Momma and Poppa Bear, plus Baby Bear. But their forbidden porridge bowls are seen as quite another sort of Three: too hot, too cold, and then just right; a compromise between extremes. 192 R E A S O N I N G\nI8.8 MATHEMATICS MADE IIARD That theory is worthless. It isn't even wrong! - W o r r c e N c P e u r r Scientists and philosophers are always searching for simplicity. They're happiest when each new thing can be defined in terms of things that have already been defined. If we can keep doing this, then everything can be defined in successive layers and levels. This is how mathe- maticians usually define numbers. They begin by defining lsvs-s1, rather, they assume that Zero needs no definition. Then they define One as the \"successor\" of Zero, Two as the succes- sor of One, and so on. But why prefer such slender chains? Why not prefer each thing to be cdnnected to as many other things as possible? The answer is a sort of paradox. As scientists, we like to make our theories as delicate and fragile as possible. We like to drrdnge things so that if the slightest thing goes wrong, everything will collapse at once! Why do scientists use such shaky strategies? So that when anything goes wrong, they'll be the first to notice it. Scientists adore that flimsiness because it helps them find the precious proofs they love, with each next step in perfect mesh with every single previous one. Even when the process fails, it only means that we have made a new discovery! Especially in the world of mathematics, it is just as bad to be nearly right as it is to be totally wrong. In a sense, that's just what mathematics is-the quest for absolute consistency. But that isn't good psychology. [n real life, our minds must always tolerate beliefs that later turn out to be wrong. It's also bad the way we let teachers shape our children's mathematics into slender, shaky tower chains instead of robust, cross-connected webs. A chain can break at any link, a tower can topple at the slightest shove. And that's what happens in a mathematics class to a child's mind whose attention turns just for a moment to watch a pretty cloud. Teachers try to convince their students that equations and formulas are more expressive than ordinary words. But it takes years to become proficient at using the language of mathematics, and until then, formulas and equations are in most respects even less trustworthy than com- monsense reasoning. Accordingly, the investment principle works against the mathematics teacher, because even though the potential usefulness of formal mathematics is great, it is also so remote that most children will continue to use only their customary methods in ordinary life, outside of school. It is not enough to tell them, \"Someday you will find this useful,\" or even, \"Ledrn this and I will love you.\" Unless the new ideas become connected to the rest of the child's world, that knowledge can't be put to work. The ordinary goals of ordinary citizens are not the same as those of professional mathemati- cians and philosophers-who like to put things into forms with as few connections as possible. For children know from everyday experience that the more cross-connected their common- sense ideas are, the more useful they're likely to be. Why do so many schoolchildren learn to fear mathematics? Perhaps in part because we try to teach the children those formal definitions, which were designed to lead to meaning-networks as sparse and thin as possible. We shouldn't assume that making careful, narrow definitions will always help children \"get things straight.\" It can also make it easier for them to get things scrambled up. Instead, we ought to help them build more robust networks in their heads. R E A S O N I N G t93\nI8.9 ROBUSTNESS AND RECOVERY Most machines that people build stop working when their parts break down. Isn't it amazing that our minds can keep on functioning while they're making changes in themselves? Indeed, they must, since minds can't simply shut down work when \"closed for renovations.\" But how do we keep functioning while vital parts are modified-or even lost? It's a fact that our brains can keep on working well in spite of injuries in which great multitudes of cells are killed. How could anything be so robust? Here are some possibilities: Duplication. It is possible to design a machine so that every one of its functions is embodied in several duplicated agents, in different places. Then, if any agent is disabled, one of its duplicates can be made to \"take over.\" A machine based on this duplication-scheme could be surprisingly robust. For example, suppose that every function were duplicated in ten agents. If an accident were to destroy tratf tne agents of that machine, the chance that any particular function would be entirely losi is the same as the chance that ten tossed coins would all come up tails-that is, less than one chance in a thousand. And many regions of the human brain do indeed have several duplicates. Self-Repair. Many of the body's organs can regenerate-that is, they can replace whichever parts ari lost to inlury or disease. However, brain cells do not usually share this ability. Conse- quently, healing cannot be the basis of much of the brain's robustness. This makes one wonder why an organ is vital as the brain has evolved to be less able than other organs to repair or ,.pi\"\". its firoken parts. Presumably, this is because it simply wouldn't help to replace individual brain-agents-unless the same healing process could also restore all the learned connections \"*olg1hose agents. Since it is those networks that embody what we've learned, merely to replace their separate parts would not restore the functions that were lost. Distributed Processes. It is possible to build machines in which no function is located in any one specific place. lnstead, each function is \"spread out\" ove-r a range of locations, so that each part's activity contributes a little to each of several different functions. Then the destruction of any small portion will not destroy any function entirely but will only cause small impairments to many different functions. Accumulation. I'm sure that all of the above methods are employed in our brains. But we also have another source of robustness that offers more advantages. Consider any learning-scheme that begins by using the method of accumulation-in which each agent tends to accumulate a family Jf subagentr thrt .\"., accomplish that agent's goals in several ways. Later, if any of those subajents beco-e impaired, their iupervisor will still be able to accomplish its job, because otheiof its subagents will remain to do that iob, albeit in different ways. So accumulation-the very simplest kind of learning-provides both robustness and versatility. Our learning-systems can build up centers of divelsity in which each agent is equipped with variou.s alternatives. When such a center is damaged, the effects may scarcely begin to show until the system's reserves are nearly exhausted. I94 R E A S O N I N G\nCHAPTER 19 WORDS AND IDEAS I am not yet so lost in lexicography, as to forget that words are the daughters of the earth, and that things are the sons of heaven. Language is only the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas: I wish, however, that the instrument might be less apt to decay, and that signs might be permanent, like the things which they denote. -Senaunr IoHNsoN\nI9.I THE ROOTS OF INTENTION The wind blows where it will, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit. - S r . f o H N Language builds things in our minds. Yet words themselves can't be the substance of our thoughts. They have no meanings by themselves; they're only special sorts of marks or sounds. If we're to understand how language works, we must discard the usual view that words denote, or represent, or designcfe; instead, their function is control: each word makes various agents change what various other agents do. If we want to understand how language works, we must never forget that our thinking-in-words reveals only a fragment of the mind's activity. We often seem to think in words. Yet we do this with no conscious sense of where and why those words originate or how they then proceed to influence our further thoughts and what we subsequently do. Our inner monologues and dialogues proceed without any effort, delibera- tion, or sense of how they're done. Now you might argue that you do know what brings those words to mind-in the sense that they are how you \"express\" your intentions and ideas. But that amounts to the same thing-since your intentions, too, appear to come and go in ways you do not understand. Suppose, for example, that at a certain moment you find you want to leave the room. Then, naturally, you'd look for the door. And this involves two mysteries: What made you want to leave the room? Was it simply that you became tired of staying in that room? Was it because you remembered something else you had to do? Whatever reasons come to mind, you still must ask what led to them. The further back you trace your thoughts, the vaguer seem those causal chains. The other side of the mystery is that we are equally ignorant of how we respond to our own intentions. Given a desire to leave the room, what led you to the thought of \"door\"? You only know that first you thought, \"lt's time to go,\" and then you thought, \"Where is the door?\" We're all so used to this that we regard it as completely natural. Yet we have barely any sense of why each thought follows the last. What connects the idea of leatting with the idea of dooft Does this result from some direct connection between two partial states of mind, of leat,ing and of door? Does it involve some sort of less direct connection, not between those states them- selves, but only between some signals that somehow represent those states? Or is it the product of yet more complex mechanisms? Our introspective abilities are too weak to answer such questions. The words we think seem to hover in some insubstantial interface wherein we understand neither the origins of the symbol-signs that seem to express our desires nor the destinations wherein they lead to actions and accomplishments. This is why words and images seem so magical: they work without our knowing how or why. At one moment a word can seem enormously meaningful; at the next moment it can seem no more than a sequence of sounds. And this is as it should be. It is the underlying emptiness of words that gives them their potential versatility. The less there is in a treasure chest, the more you'll be able to put in it. W O R D S A N D I D E A S\nI9.2 THE I,.ANqUAGE.AGENCY The use of language is not confined to its being the medium through which we communicate ideas to one another. . . . Words are the instrument by which we form aII our abstractions, by which we fashion and embody our ideas, and by which we are enabled to glide along a series of premises and conclusions with a rapidity so great as to leave in memory no trace of the successiye steps of this process; and we remain unconscious of how much we owe to this. - l o H N L . R o c n r We're normally quite unaware of how our brain-machines enable us to see, or walk, or remember what we want. And we're equally unaware of how we speak or of how we compre- hend the words we hear. As far as consciousness can tell, no sooner do we hear a phrase than all its meanings spring to mind-yet we have no conscious sense of how those words produce their effects. Consider that all children learn to speak and understand-yet few adults will ever recognize the regularities of their grammars. For example, all English speakers learn that saying \"big brown dog\" is right, while \"brown big dog\" is somehow wrong. How do we learn which phrases are admissible? No language scientist even knows whether brains must learn this once or twice-first, for knowing what to say, and second, for knowing what to hear. Do we reuse the same machinery for both? Our conscious minds just cannot tell, since consciousness does not reveal how language works. However, on the other side, language seems to play a role in much of what our consciousness does. I suspect that this is because our language-agency plays special roles in how we think, through having a greatdeal of control over the memory-systems in other agencies and therefore over the huge accumulations of knowledge they contain. But language is only a part of thought. We sometimes seem to think in words-and sometimes not. What do we \"think in\" when we aren't using words? And how do the agents that work with words communicate with those that don't? Since no one knows, we'll have to make a theory. We'll start by imagining that the language-system is divided into three regions. WORD': .: AGENTS ii UANGUAGE ,1,AGSlfGY1:1,r,,1 1t \\ 7 IANC.UAOE !r:AGENCYti:ir, The upper region contains agents that are concerned specifically with words. The lower region includes all the agencies that are affected by words. And in the center lie the agencies involved with how words engage our recollections, expectations, and other kinds of mental processes. There is also one peculiarity: the language-agency seems to have an unusual capacity to control its own memories. Our diagram suggests that this could be because the language- agency can exploit itself as though it were just another agency. SFEAXEN W O R D S A N D I D E A S\nI9.3 WORDS AND IDEAS How does an insubstantial word like \"apple\" lead you to think of a real thing-an object of a certain size that is red, round, sweet, and has a shiny, thin-peeled skin? How could a plain acoustic sound produce such complex states of mind, involving all those qualities of color, substance, taste, and shape? Presumably, each different quality involves a different agency. But then-in view of all we've said about why different agents can't communicate-how could such varying recipients all \"understand\" the selfsame messages? Do language-agents have unusual abilities to communicate with different kinds of agencies? Many people have tried to explain language as though it were separate from the rest of psychology. Indeed, the study of language itself was often divided into smaller subjects, called by traditional names llke syntax, grdmmdr, and semantlcs. But because there was no larger, coherent theory of thinking to which to attach those fragments, they tended to lose contact with one another and with reality. Once we assume that language and thought are different things, we're lost in trying to piece together what was never separate in the first place. This is why, in the following pages, I'll put aside most of the old language theories and return to the questions that led to them: How are words involved with mental processes? How does language enable people to communicate? In the next few sections, we'll introduce two kinds of agents that contribute to the power of words. The first kind, called \"polynemes,\" are involved with our long-term memories. A poly- neme is a type of K-line; it sends the same, simple signal to many different agencies: each of those agencies must learn, for itself, what to do when it receiyes that signal. When you hear the word \"apple,\" a certain polyneme is aroused, and the signal from this polyneme will put your Color agency into a state that represents redness. The same signal will set you;. Shape agency into a state that represents roundness, and so forth. Thus, the polyneme for \"apple\" is really very simple; it knows nothing whatever about apples, colors, shapes, or anything else. It is merely a switch that turns on processes in other agencies, each of which has learned to respond in its own way. Later we'll discuss another type of language-agent that we'll call an \"isonome. \" Each isonome controls a short-term memory in each of many agencies. For example, suppose we had just been talking about a certain apple, and then I said, \"Please put it in this pail.\" In this case, you would assume that the word \"it\" refers to the apple. However, if we had been discussing your left shoe, you would assume \"it\" referred to that shoe. A word like \"it\" excites an isonome whose signal has no particular significance by itself, but controls what various agencies do with certain recent memories. I98 W O R D S A N D I D E A S\n19.4 OBJECTS AND PROPERTIES what does a word like \"apple\" mean? This is really many questions in one. How could hearing the word \"dpple\" make you \"imdgine\" an apple? How could seeing an apple activate a word-agent for \"apple\"? How could thiniing about an apple make one think of the word for \"apple\"? How could seeing an apple make one wordlessly recall the flavor of an apple? It's usually impossible to perfectly \"define\" a word because you cannot capture everything you mean in iust a phrase; an apple means a thousand things. However, you can usually say -some of what you mean by making lists of properties. For example, you could say that an \"apple\" is something round and red and good to eat. But what exactly is a \"property\"? Again, it'i hard to define that idea-but there are several things to say about what properties we like our properties to have. We like the kinds of properties that do not change capriciously. The color of your car will stay the same from day to day, and, barring accidents, so will its basic size and shape, as well as the substances of which it is made. Now, suppose you were to paint that car a new color: its shape and size would remain the same. This suggests another thing we like to find in our properties: The most useful sets of properties are those whose members do not interact too much. This explains the universal popularity of that particular combination of properties size, color, shape, and substance. Because these attributes scarcely interact at all with one another, you can put them together in any combination whatsoever, to make an object that is either large or small, red or green, wooden or glass, and having the shape of a sphere or of a cube. And we derive a wonderful power from representing things in terms of properties thai do not interact: this makes imagination practical. It lets us anticipate what will happen when we invent new combinations and variations we've never seen before. For example, suppose that a certain obiect almost works for a certain job-except for being a bit too small; then you can imagine using a \"larger\" one. In the same way, you can imagine changing the color of a dress or its size, shape, or the fabric of which it's made, without altering any of its other properties. Why is it so easy to imagine the effects of such changes? First, these properties reflect the nature of reality; when we change an object's color or shape, its other properties are usually left unchanged. However, that doesn't explain why such changes do not interact inside the n'rind. Why is it so easy to imagine a small brown wooden cube or a long red silk skirt? The simplest explanation is that we represent each of the properties of material, color, size and shape in separate agencies. Then those properties can simultaneouslv arouse separate partial states of mind at once, in several divisions of the mind. That way, a single word can activate many different kinds of thoughts at oncel Thus the word \"apple\" can set your Color agency into a \"redness\" state, put your Shape agency into a \"roundness\" s1x1s-s1, really, into a representa- tion of an indented sphere with a stem-and cause your Taste and Size agencies to react in accord with memories of previous experiences with apples. How does language do such things? W O R D S A N D I D E A S 199\nI9.5 POLYNEMES What happens when a single agent sends messages to several different agencies? In many cases, such a message will have a different effect on each of those other agencies. As I men- tioned earlier, I'll call such an agent a \"polyneme. \" For example, your word-agent for the word \"apple\" must be a polyneme because it sets your agencies for color, shape, and size into unrelated states that represent the independent properties of being red, round, and \"apple- sized. \" apple golfball tomato slicE But how could the same message come to have such diverse effects on so many agencies, with each effect so specifically appropriate to the idea of \"apple\"? There is only one explanation: Each of those other agencies must already have learned its own response to that same signal. Because polynemes, like politicians, mean different things to different listeners, each listener must learn its own, different way to react to that message. (The prefix poly- is to suggest diversity, and the suffrx-neme is to indicate how this depends on memory.) To understand a polyneme, each dgency must learn its own specific and appropri- ate response. Each dgency must have its private dictionary or memory bank to tell it how to respond to ettery polyneme. How could all those agencies learn how to respond to each polyneme? If each polyneme were connected to a K-line in each agency, each of those K-lines would need only to learn what partial state to arouse inside its agency. The drawing below suggests that those Klines could form little \"memorizers\" next to the agencies that they affect. Thus, memories are formed and stored close to the places where they are used. apple golfball tomato slice MEMORIZERS Can any simple scheme like this give rise to all the richness of the meaning of a real language- word? The answer is that all ideas about meaning will seem inadequate by themselves, since nothing can mean anything except within some larger context of ideas. 200 W O R D S A N D I D E A S\n19.6 RECOGNIZERS When we see an apple, how do we know it as an apple? How do we recognize a friend-or even know when we're seeing a person? How do we recognize things? The simplest way to recognize something is to verify that it has certain properties. To recognize an apple, in many circumstances, it might suffice to look for something that is red AND round AND apple-sized. In order to do that, we need a kind of agent that detects when all three conditions occur at once. The simplest form of this would be an agent that becomes active whenever all three of its inputs are active. ''APPLE'' We can use AND-agents to do many kinds of recognition, but the idea also has serious limitations. If you tried to recognize a chair that way, you would usually fail, if you insisted on finding \"four legs AND a seat AND a back.\" You scarcely ever see four legs of a chair at the same time, since at least one leg is usually out of view. Besides, if someone's sitting in the chair, you often cannot see the seat at all. In real life, no recognition-scheme will always work if it's based on absolutely perfect evidence. A more judicious scheme would not demand that every feature of a chair be seen; instead, it would only \"weigh the evidence\" that a chair is present. For example, we could make a chair-agent that becomes active whenever five or more of our six chair features are in sight: BACK SEAT \"cHArR\" LEG This scheme, too, will make mistakes. It will miss the chair if too many features are out of sight. It will mistake other objects for chairs if those features are present but in the wrong arrangement-for example, if all four legs are attached to the same side of a \"seat.\" Indeed, it usually won't suffice merely to verify that all the required parts are there-one also has to verify their dimensions and relationships; otherwise our recognizer would not distinguish a chair from a couch or even from a bunch of boards and sticks. Failure to verify relationships is the basis of a certain type of nonsense joke: What has eight legs and flies? -- A string quartet on a foreign tour. SH , W O R D S A N D I D E A S 201\n19.7 IiTEIGHING EVIDENCE There are important variations on the theme of \"weighing evidence.\" Our first idea was just to count the bits of evidence in favor of an object's being a chair. But not all bits of evidence are equally valuable, so we can improve our scheme by giving different \"weights\" to different kinds of evidence. Fronl Fronl Back Seat Back How could we prevent this chair recognizer from accepting a table that appeared to be composed of four legs and a seat? One approach would be to try to rearrange the weights to avoid this. But if we already possessed a table recognizer, we could use its output as evidence dgdinst there being a chair by adding it in with a negative weight! How should one decide what number weights to assign to each feature? In 1959, Frank Rosenblatt invented an ingenious evidence-weighing machine called a \"Perceptron.\" It was equipped with a procedure that au- tomatically learned which weights to use from being told by a teacher which of the distinctions it made were unacceptable. All feature-weighing machines have serious limitations because, although they can measure the presence or absence of various features, they cannot take into account enough of the relations among those features. For example, in the book Percepfrons, Seymour Papert and I proved mathematically that no feature-weighing machine can distinguish between the two kinds of patterns drawn below-no matter how cleverly we choose the weights. CONNECTED DISCONNECTED Both drawings on the left depict patterns that are connected-that is, that can be drawn with a single line. The patterns on the right are disconnected in the sense of needing two separate lines. Here is a way to prove that no feature-weighing machine can recognize this sort of distinction. Suppose that you chopped each picture into a heap of tiny pieces. It would be impossible to say which heaps came from connected drawings and which came from discon- nected drawings-simply because each heap would contain identical assortments of picture fragments! Every heap would contain exactly four pictures of right-angle turns, two \"line endings,\" and the same total lengths of horizontal and vertical line segments. It is therefore impossible to distinguish one heap from another by \"adding up the evidence,\" because all information about the relations between the bits of evidence has been lost. Leg Leg Leg zuz W O R D S A N D I D E A S\nI9.8 GENERATIANG We're always learning from experience by seeing some examples and then applying them to situations that we've never seen before. A single frightening growl or bark may lead a baby to fear all dogs of similar size-or, even, arlimals of every kind. How do we make generalizations from fragmentary bits of evidence? A dog of mine was once hit by a car, and it never went down the same street again-but it never stopped chasing cars on other streets. Philosophers of every period have tried to generalize about how we learn so much from our experiences. They have proposed many theories about this, using names like \"abstraction,\" \"induction,\" \"abduction,\" and so forth. But no one has found a way to make consistently correct generalizations-presumably because no such foolproof scheme exists, and whatever we \"learn\" may turn out to be wrong. In any case, we humans do not learn in accord with any fixed and constant set of principles; instead, we accumulate societies of learning-schemes that differ both in quality and kind. We've already seen several ways to generalize. One way is to construct uniframes by formu- lating descriptions that suppress details we regard as insignificant. A related idea is built into our concept of a \"level-band.\" Yet another scheme is implicit in the concept of a polyneme, which tries to guess the character of things by combining expectations based upon some inde- pendent properties. In any case, there is an intimate relationship between how we \"represent\" what we already know and the generalizations that will seem most plausible. For example, when we first proposed a \"recognizer\" for a chair, we composed it from the polynemes for several already familiar ideas, namely seats, legs, and backs. We gave these features certain weights. If we changed the values of those evidence weights, this would produce new recognizer- agents. For example, with a negative weight for \"back,\" the new agent would reiect chairs but would accept benches, stools, or tables. If all the weights were increased (but the required total were kept the same), the new recognizer would accept a wider class of furniture or furniture with more parts hidden from visw-ss well as other objects that weren't furniture at all. Why would there be any substantial likelihood that such variations would produce useful recognizers? That would be unlikely indeed, if we assembled new recognizers by combining old ones selected at random. But there is a much better chance for usefulness if each new recog- nizer is made by combining signals from agents that have already proven themselves useful in related contexts. As Douglas Hofstadter has explained: Making variations on a theme is the crux of creatitity. But it is not some magical, mysterious process thot occurs when two indivisible concepts collide; it is a conse- quence of the divisibility of concepts into already significant subconceptual ele- ments. W O R D S A N D I D E A S 203\n19.9 RECOGNIANG THOUGHTS How do we recognize our own ideas? At first, that must seem a strange question. But consider two different situations. In the first case, I hold up an apple and ask, \"What is this?\" We've already seen how such a sight could lead to activating polynemes for words like \"apple\" or \"fruit.\" In the second case, there is no apple on the scene, and I ask instead, \"What do we call those round, red, thin-peeled fruits?\" Yet this time, too, you end up with an apple thought. Isn't it remarkable that one can \"recognize\" a thing merely from hearing words? What is there in common to our recognizing things in two such different ways? The answer is that inside the brain, these situations really aren't so different. In neither case is there a real apple in the brain. In both cases, some part of mind must recognize what's happening in certain other parts of mind. Let's pursue this example and imagine that those words have caused three partial states to become active among your agencies. Your Taste agency is in the condition corresponding to apple taste, your Physical Structure agency is representing thin-peeled, and your Substance agency is in the state that corresponds to fruit. Thus, even though there is no apple in sight, this combination would probably activate one of your \"apple\" polynemes. Let's call them \"apple-nemes\" for short. How could we make a machine do that? We would simply attach another recognizer to the apple-neme, a recognizer whose inputs come from memories instead of from the sensory world. SHAPE COLOR stzE APPLE-NEME lruit SUBSTANCE .apple-V In a limited sense, such an agent could be said to recognize a certain state of mind or-if we dare to use the phrase-a certain combination of ideas. ln this sense, both physical and mental obiects could engdge similar representations and processes. As we accumulate these recognizers, each agency will need a second kind of memory-a sort of recognition dictionary of recognizers to recognize its various states. M E M O R I Z E R S INTERAGENTS R E C O G N I Z E R S This simple scheme can explain only a little of how we represent ideas, since only certain things can be described by such simple lists of properties. We usually need additional informa- tion about constraints and relationships among the parts of things-for example, to represent the knowledge that the wheels of a car must be mounted underneath its body. To discover how we might represent such things is becoming a major concern of modern research in both psychology and Artificial Intelligence. TASTE STRUCTURE o @@o @ o @ @ . W O R D S A N D I D E A S\nI9.IO CLOSING THE RING Now let's redraw the diagram for the language-agency, but fill in more details from the last few sections. DING ASCEN NEMES MEMORIZERS RECOGNIZERS .:.t$::t.t ftuny SENSO ffif+ thln- peeled NE :n..i A.:. s.:: cir.U iR .E Something amazing happens when you go around a loop like this! Suppose you were to imagine three properties o1an apple-for example, its substance, taste, and thin-peeled struc- ture] Then, .uln if th\"r. *.r. oo apple on the scene-and even if you had not yet thought of the word \"apple\"-the recognition-agent on the left will be aroused enough to excite your \"apple\" polyn-e*e. (This is bicause I used the number three for the required sum in the apple poiyrr\"-\"'r recognizer instead of demanding that all five properties be present.) That agent can ih..r ,ro,rr. the klines in other agencies, like those for color and shape-and thus evoke your memories of other apple properties! In other words, if you start with enough clues to arouse one of your apple-tri-.t, it will automatically arouse memories of the other properties and qualitiei of appies and create a more complete impression, \"simulus,\" or hallucination of the e*perience oiieei.tg, feeling, and even of eating an apple. This way, a simple loop machine can reconstruct a larger whole from clues about only certain of its partsl Many thinkers have assumed that such abilities lie beyond the reach of all machines. Yet here we see that retrieving the whole from a few of its parts requires no magic leap past logic and necessity, but only simple societies of agents that \"recognize\" when certain requirements are met. If iomething is red and round and has the right size and shape for an apple-and nothing else seems wrong-then one will probably think \"apple.\" This method for arouiing complete recollections from incomplete clues-we could call it \"reminding\"-i5 pslygrful but imperfect. Our speaker might have had in mind not an apple, but some other tou.rd, red, fruit, such as a tomato or a pomegranate. Any such process leads only to guesses-and frequently these will be wrong. Nonetheless, to think effectively, we often have to turn aside from certainty-to take some chance of being wrong. Our memory systems are powerful because they're not constrained to be perfectl W O R D S A N D I D E A S 205\nCEAPTER 2C CONTEXT AND AMBIGTIITY Any attempt at a philosophical anangement under categories of the words of our language must reyedl the fact that it is impossible to separate and circumscribe the seyeral groups by absolutely distinct boundaries. Were we to disengage their interwoyen ramifications, and seek to confine every word to its main or original meaning, we should find some secondary meaning has become so firmly associated with many words and phroses, that to seyer the alliance would be to deprive our language of the richness due to an infinity of natural adaptations. -IoHN L. Roce r\n20.I AMBIGUITY We often find it hard to \"express our thoughls\"-16 summarize our mental states or put our ideas into words. It islempting to blame this on the ambiguity of words, but the problem is deeper than that. Thoughts themselv es are ambiguous! At first, one might complain that that's impossible. \"I'm thinking exactly what I'm thinking; there's no wdy it could bi otherwise. And this has nothing to do with whether I can express it precisely.\" Bttt\"what you're thinking now\" is itself inherently ambiguous. If we interpret it to mean the states of all your agencies, that would include much that cannot be \"expressed\" simply because it is not acc.rr=ibl. to your langrsage-agency. A more modest interpretation of ;;iioi yo,u'rn thinking now\" would be a partial indication.of the present states of some of your higher-level agenciesl But the significance of any agency's state depends on how it is likely to affect the states of olh., agenciel. This implies thaiin order to \"express\" your present state of mind, you have to partiallf anticipate whal some of your agencies are about to do. Inevitably, Uv ttri, ii-. yo,r'u. managed to express yourself, you're no longer in the state you were before; your thoughts were a-blguous to begin with, and you never dld succeed in expressing them but merely replaced them with other thoughts' This is not lust a matter of words. The problem is that our states of mind are usually subiect to change. The properties of physical things tend to persist when their contexts are changed- but thel'significance\" of a thought, idea, or partial state of mind depends upon which other thoughts aie active at the time and upon what eventually emerges from the conflicts and negotiations among one's agencies. It is an illusion to assume a clear and absolute distinction bet\"*een ,.expressing\" and '{hinking,\" since expressing is itself an active process that involves simplifying and recJnstituting \" -..tt\"l state by detaching it from the more diffuse and variable parts of its context. The listener, too, must deal with ambiguity. You understand \"I wrote a note to my sister,\" despite the fact that the word \"note\" could mean a short letter or comment, a banknote, a *rrsical sound, an observation, a distinction, or a notoriety. If all our separate words are ambiguous by themselves, why are sentences so clearly understood? Because the context of \"r\"tri.p\"r\"te word is sharpened by the other words, as well as by the context of the listener's recent past. We can tolerite the ambiguity of words because we are already so competent at coping with the ambiguity of thoughts. C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y 207\n2O.2 NEGOTTATING AMBIGIIfIY Many common words are ambiguous enough that even simple sentences can be understood in several ways. The astronomer married the star. It probably was a movie star-though the listener may have experienced a moment of con- fusion. The trouble is that the word \"star\" is linked to different polynemes for a celestial body, a theatrical celebrity, or an object with a certain shape. The momentary confusion comes because the word \"astronomer\" gives us an initial bias toward the celestial sense of \"star.\" But that inhuman meaning causes conflict in our marriage-agent, and this soon leads to another, more consistent interpretation. The problem is harder when a sentence contains two or more ambiguous words. Iohn shot two bucks. Alone, the word \"shot\" could refer either to shooting a gun or, in American slang, to making a bet. By itself, the word \"buck\" could mean either a dollar or a male deer. These alternatives permit at least four conceivable interpretations. Two of them are quite implausible, because people rarely shoot bullets at dollars or bet deer. But the other two are possible, since, unfor- tunately, people do bet dollars and shoot at deer. Without more clues, we have no way to choose between these interpretations. Yet we wouldn't have the slightest doubt that \"buck\" means dollar if the previous context gave a hint that money or gambling was involved-rather than hunting, forestry, or outdoor life. How do \"contexts\" work to clarify such ambiguities? The activity of an outdoors polyneme would start by producing a small bias for arousing deer rather than dollar and gun instead of bef. Then the \"ring-closing\" effect would swiftly make that preference sharp. Other polynemes like those for hunting and killing will soon be engaged and will combine to activate the recog- nizers for yet other, related polynemes like those for forest and animaL soon this will produce a collection of mutually supporting polynemes that establish a single, consistent interpretation. One might fear that this would lead, instead, to an avalanche that arouses all the agents of the mind. That would be less likely to happen if the different possible senses of each word are made to compete, by being assembled into cross-exclusion groups. Then, as the polynemes for deer and gun gain strength, they will weaken and suppress the competing nemes for money and for wagering-and that will weaken, in turn, the other polynemes that support the alternative context of making bets. The end effect of this will be almost instantaneous. In only a few cycles of the meaning ring, the agents associated with deer and gun will completely suppress their competitors. 208 C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y\n20.3 VISUAT AMBIGTIITT We usually think of \"ambiguity\" as an aspect of language-but ambiguities are just as com- mon in vision, too. What's that structure shown below? It could be regarded as nine separate blocks, as an arch supported by two other arches, or as a single, complicated, nine-block arch! What process makes us able to see that superarch as composed of three little arches rather than of .rirr\" ,.p\"rrte blocks? How, for that matter, do we recognize-those as blo.cks in the first fir\"\", instead of seeing only lines and corners? These \"ambiguitieg\" are- normally resolved so i,ri.kly and quietly thit oui higher-level agencies have no sense of conflict at all. To be sure, we sometim\", hru\" the sense of perceiving the same structure in several ways at once-for example, as both a single complex arch and as three separate simpler arches. But we usually lock in on one particular interpretation. Sometimes no lowerlevel information can resolve an ambiguity-as in the case of this example by Oliver Selfridge.-TAE CAT Here, there is no difference whatever between the H and the A, yet we see them as having distinct identities in their different contexts. Evidently, the \"simulus\" produced by the visual sense is strongly affected by the state of some language-related agency. Furthermo_re, just as we can describ. th. ,\"-, figure in different ways, we often can describe different figures in the ,^*. *\"y. Thus, we recognize all these figures as similar, though no two of them are actually the same: A If we described each of these in terms of the lengths, directions, and locations of their lines, they would all seem very different. But we can make them all seem much the same by describ- ing each of them in the same way, perhaps like this: \"a triangle with two lines extended from oie of its rertices.\" The point is that what we \"see\" does not depend only or what reaches our eyes from the outside *o.ld. The manner in which we interpret those stimuli depends to a large extent on what is already taking place inside our agencies. C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y\n2O.4 TOCKING.IN AND WEEDING-OUr Most language-words are linked to many different polynemes, which correspond to the many \"meaning-senses\" of each word. To arouse so many polynemes at once would often lead to conflicts as each tries to set one's agencies into different states at the same time. If there are no other contextual clues, some of these conflicts would be resolved in accord with their connec- tion strengths. For example, upon hearing \"The astronomer married the stdr,\" a playwright would tend to give priority to the theatrical sense of \"star,\" whereas an astronomet *buid think first of a distant sun, other things being equal. But other things a.re ng! usually equal. At every moment a person's mind is already involved with some \"context\" in w-hich many agents are actively aroused. Because of this, as each new word arouses different polynemes, these will compete to change the states of those agents. Some of those changes will gain support as certain combinations of agents reinforce one another. Others that lose support and are left to stand alone will tend to weaken, and most ambiguities will thus be weeded out. In a few cycles, the entire system will firmly \"lock in\" on one meaning-sense for each word and firmly suppress the rest. A computer program that actually worked this way was developed by )ordan Pollack and David Waltz. When applied to the sentence, \"lohn shot two bucks,\" and supplied with the faintest context clue, the program would indeed usually settle into a single, coniiitent interpre- tation. In other words, after a few cycles, the agents ended up in a pattern of mutually support- ing activities in which only one sense of each word remained strongly active while all the other meaning-senses were suppressed. Thereafter, whether this \"alliance\" of word-senses was in- volved with hunting or with gambling, it became so self-supporting that it could resist any subsequent small signal from outside. In effect, the system had found a stable, unambiguoui interpretation of the sentence. What can be done if such a system settles on a wrong interpretation? Suppose, for example, that an \"outdoors\" clue had already made the system decide that fohn was hunting, but later it was told that fohn was gambling in the woods. Since a single new context clue might not be able to overcome an established alliance of meaning-senses, it might be necessaty for some higher-level agency to start the system out afresh. What if the end result of locking-in were unacceptable to other agencies? Simply repeating the process would only lead to making the same mistake again. One way to prevent that would be to record which meaning-senses were adopted in the previous cycle and suppress them temporarily at the start of the next cycle. This would probably produce a new interpretation. There is no guarantee that this method will always find an interpretation that yields a mean- ing consistent with all the words of the sentence. Then, if the locking-in process should fail, the listener will be confused. There are other methods that one could attempt, for example, to imagine a new context and then restart the ring-closing process. But no single method will always work. To use the power of language, one must acquire many different ways to under- stand. 2ro C O N T E X T A N D A M S I G U I T Y\n20.5 MICRONEMES That old idea of classifying things by properties is not entirely satisfactory, because so many kinds of qualities interaci irlcomflicated ways. Every situation or condition we experience is influenced or, so to speak, colored, by thousands ofcontextual shades and hues, iust as looking through a tinted glass has faint effects on everything we see' material: animate, inanimate; natural, artificial; ideal, actual perceptual: color, texture, taste, sound, temperature iolidity: hardness, density, flexibility, sttength shape: angularity, curv dturc, sy mmetry, v erticality permanenc e: rarity, age, fragility, replaceability iocation: office, home, t'ehicle, theater, city, forest, farm environme nt: indoors, ou t do or s ; public, pritt at e activity: hunting, gambling, working, entertaining relationshi pz cooperation, conflict: negotiating, confronting security: tilety, danger; refuge, exposure; escdpe, defeat Some of these conditions and relationships may correspond to language-words, but for most of them we have no words, iust as we have no expressions for most flavors and aromas, gestures and intonations, attitudes'and dispositions. I'll call them \"micr6nspss\"-those inner mental context clues that shade our minds; activities in ways we can rarely express. Th-.tf is a somewhat different microstructure to each person's thoughts; indeed, their inexpressibility reflects our individuality. Nevertheless, we can clarify our image of the mind by envisioning these unknown influences as embodied in the forms of particular agents. Accordingly, in the next few sections, we'll envision our micronemes as K-lines that reach into many agencies with widespread effects on the arousal and suppression of other agents-including other micronemes. These micro- nemes participate in aliihose \"locking-in\" and \"weeding-out\" processes, so that, for example, the activity ol yorrt microneme for \"outdoors\" makes a small contribution to arousing your .hunting\"'*i.ro.r.-.. While each such effect may be relatively small, the effects of activating many micronemes will usually combine to establish a context within which most words are understood unambiguouslY. For example, in Jne context the word \"Boston\" might bring to mind some thoughts about the American Revolution. In a different setting, the same word might lead one to think instead of a geographic location. Other contexts might yield thoughts about famous universities, sport- i\"g t?\"tir, iife-styles, accents of speech, or traditional meals. Each of these concepts must be refiresented by a certain network of agents that are connected, directly or indirectly, to the word-agent for Boston. But hearing or thinking that word by itself is not enough to determine which of thor\" word-sense networks to activate; this must also depend upon other aspects of the present context. Our hypothesis is that this comes about principally through each word- sense agent learning to recognize the activation of certain combinations of micronemes. Even\"modest faniilies of micronemes could span vast ranges of contexts. A mere forty inde- pendentmicronemes could specify a trillion different contexts-and we surely have thousands, and perhaps millions of different micronemes. C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y 2Ll\n20.6 THE NEMEIC SPIRAT Our polynemes and micronemes grow into great branching networks that reach every level of every agency. They approximate the general form of a hierarchy, but one that is riddled with shortcuts, cross-connections, and exceptions. No one could ever comprehend all the details of the connections that develop inside a single human individual; that wtuld amount to grasping how all that person's thoughts and inclinations interact. At best, we can envision only thE broadest outlines of such structures: . LANGUAGE ]. . , . . . : , , , . , : so0lAr- FivsrCnl ' ' : ' : ' ' . . . ' . ' .

'' ,'' ' In regions near the agencies for speech, some elements of this network might signify or represent ideas and thoughts we can easily express in words. But because speaking is a social act, we are far less able to express the significance of the nemes involved with aeencies that are not directly concerned with communication. This is because those agencies are Lss constrained by the discipline of public language; accordingly, the nemes insidi those asencies can varv more from one person to the next. In any case, our higherJevel agencies are generally unaware of what our lower-level agents do; they supervise and regulate-but scarcely comprehend at all-what happenr ,-o1gih.i, subordinates. For example, a high-level agency might find that a certain rubrg..r\"y is unpro- ductive, because it is responding to too many micronemes-or to too few-and adiusl i* sensitivity accordingly. Like a B-brain, a controlling agency could make such judgments with- out comprehending the local meanings of those micronemes. This could also provide a basis for controlling the levels of the activities of those other agencies-just ,r *. ,ugg\"sted when we discussed the idea of a \"spiral\" computation within an agency and its K-line trees. When the work appears to be going well, the supervisor can direct the lowerlevel processes to \"spiral down\" toward small details. But when there seem to be too many obstacles, the level of activity would be made to \"spiral up\" instead, to levels capable of diagnosing and altering an ineffective plan. C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y\n20.7 CONNECTIONS To speak and understand a language well, an ordinary person must learn thousands of words' To learn the proper us; ;i; sir,fle i'ord must involve great numbers of connections between the agents for that word and other agents. what could cause such connections to be made, and what might be their physical embodiments? Any compr.t.rrii.'theory of the mind must include some ideas about the nature of the connections among agents. Consider that a person can learn to \"associate\" virtually any com- bination of ideas o, *?rJt. Does-this require us to assume that it is possihle for a given KJine agent to become connected, directly, to any of thousands or millions of other agents? That seems out of tn. q\"Lriion, in view of what we know about connections in the human brain' il;;; biain cells hru. fib.rs that branch out enough to-approach-many.thousands of other ..lts-brrt few of them branch out enough to reach millions of other cells, and as far as we k;;;, a mature brain cell can only -ake\"new connections to other cells that already lie close L tn. fibers that branch into or out from it. Furthermore' we do not seem to grow many new brain cells after birth; o1 th. contrary, their number actually decreases. To be sure, brain cells continue to \"mature'i fo, ,.u..al years, and probably their fibers grow extensively' But no one v.i f.\"\"*r whether this comes about \", , ,\"r.tlt of learning new connections or whether it must ir;p;;\" first, to make it feasible for those cells to learn new connections' Even the ,rr\"rrg.-\"rrts of long-distance connections between our brain cells do not permit direct connection between arbitrary pairs of agents, for those long connections are generally ,rr\"r,g.d in relativeiy \"iJ.rLV Lr\"di.r, l.r, ,\"gul^t but otherwise resembling the parallel path- *\"v, F-- skin to brain. Foitunately, direct clnnections are not really necessary, for the same reasons that every t.t.ptto\". in the world can easily be connected to any other telephone without the need foi \"onn.\"ting a billion separate wires to each house. Instead, telephone ,yrt\"-, make their connections indirectly, by using agencies called \"exchanges\" that require only moder\"t. ,r,r*b..s of wires. I don't mean to suggest that brains use the sorts of switching- schemes found itt i\"t\"pt o\"e systems but only to say that it is not necessary for every Kline \"g.\"i to directly contait every agent to which it might eventually become linked' There are several factors thaireduce the magnitude of the interconnection problem' First, in order to reproduce the major features of a remembered partial state of mind, it should suffice to activate only a representative sample of its agents' Second, according to our theory of knowledge-trees, mosi Klines' \"orrrre\"iio.ts are indirect to begin with, since th.ey connect only to other,-nearby K-line trees. A polyneme, too, need be-connected only to a single memorizer \"g.rrt ,r\"r, .r.ir agency. And ni K-line needs potential connections to all the agents in any \"i.rr\"y, since it is Jnough to make connections only in a certain level-band. C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y 2r3\nTRANSMITTING.AGENTS RECEIVING.AGENTS 2O.8 CONNECTION IJNES Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear. -Wrr,lrelr S gare spnene The diagram below depicts a connection-scheme that permits many agents to communicate with one a1-other, yet trses surprisingly few connectior wires. It w;s invented by Calvin E. Mooers in 1946, before the modern era of computers. Here is how we \"o,rld use lrst ten wires to enable any of several hundred \"transmittinglagents\" to activate any of a similar number of \"receiving-agents.\" The trick is to make.r\"h trrnrrnitting-agent excite not one, but five of those wires, chosen at random from the available ten. ThJn lach receivirrg-agent is provided with an AND-agent connected to recognize the same five-wire combinationl In this example, each receiving-agent is aroused by precisely one transmitting-agent. If we wanted each receiving-agent to respond to several tranimitting-agents, we coulJioin together several separate recognizers so that the receiving-agent's input lools like a tree with a recognizer at the tip of each branch. How could those receivers learn which input paitet\"r-io recognize? One way would be to use the kind of evidence-weighing machinery *. d.rciibed earlier. Indeed, for brain cells.that would seem quite plausible, since a typical 6rain cell actually has a treelike network to collect its input signals. No or,. yet knows quite what those netwoik, do, but I wouldn't be surprised if many of them turn out to be simple Perceptron-like learning machines. The network shown in the diagram above has a serious deficiency: it can transmit only one signal at a time. The problem is that if several transmitting-agents were aroused at once, aimost all ten connecting wires would be activated, which woulJ tlien arouse all the receiving-agents and cause an avalanche. However, we can make that problem disappear by proviJi.r! th. system with enough additional connection wires. For exampl., ruppoi. there\"were ten thou- sand connection wires rather than ten, and that each transmitting-agent became attached to about fifty of them. Then, even if one hundred agents were to r.ltrd-th.i, signals all at once, there would be less than one chance in a trillion that this would erroneoisly activate any particular receiving-agent! (B) (c) (B) (A) 2r4 C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y\n20.9 DISTRIBUTED MEMORY Let's redraw our connection line-scheme in the form of three layers of agents. ,a'\"___<^ -\\'-\\/17 \\ X roorHERAGEA'IS ThANSIIITTERS cot{NEcToRS FECEIVENS The transmitting-agents can simply be KJines or memorizers, since each of them sends signals to a variety of lther agents. ihe receiving-agents can be simple recognizers, since each oi the- is aroused only by certain combinations of connector-agents. However, because a ivpi\"li \"g.\"t must both arouse other agents and be aroused by other agents, it must tend to branch botfr at its inputs and at its outputs. So our network can be drawn to look like this: When we represent the agents this way, we see that they can all be simple evidence-weighing agents, onlv with different \"threshold\" values. Each recognizer could start out with connections to many connector-agents and then, somehow, learnto recognize certain signals by altering its \"o.r.r.\"iion weights. Would it be practical to build learning machines according to such a simple scheme?1hat was the dream of several scientists in the I950s, but none of their experi- -.rrt, worked well enough to stimulate further work. Recently, a new type of network machine has shown more promise: the so-called Boltzmann machine resembles a Perceptron in having an automatic procedure for learning new connection weights, but it also has some ability to resolve ambiguities by using a variety of \"ring-closing\" process. The next few years should tell us more about such machines. Perhaps they could provide a basis for memory-systems that work very much the way K-lines do, to reproduce old partial states of mind. In designing these clever ways to reduce the numbers of connecting wires, most researchers haue profoseJ wiring the connections at random, so that no signal on any particular wire has \"ny rig.rifi\"ance by itself but represents only a fragment of each of many unrelated activities' This has the mathematical advantage of producing very few accidental interactions. However, this seems to me a bad idea: it would moke it very hard for a transmitting-ogency to learn how to exploit a receiting-agency's abilities. I suspect that when we understand the brain, we'll discover that small groups of connection lines do indeed have local significance-because they will turn out to be the most important agents of nearby levels. The connection lines themselves will constitute our micronemes! C O N T E X T A N D A M B I G U I T Y 2r5\ncrnPrER 2I TRANS.FRAMES\n2!.! THE PRONOUNS OF THE MIND We often say what we want to say in fewer words than might seem possible. \"Do you see the table oYer there?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you see the red block on it?\" \"Yes-\" \"Good. Please bring it to me.\" That first \"it\" saves the speaker from having to say \"that table\" again. The second \"it\" does the same for \"the red btock.\" Accordingly, many people consider a pronoun like \"it\" to be an abbreviation or substitute for another phrase used recently. But when we look at this more carefully, we see that a pronoun need not refer to any phrase at all. For instance, the word \"this\" in the previous sentence was not an abbreviation for any particular phrase. Instead, it served as a signal to you, the reader, to examine more carefully a certain partial state of mind -in this case, a certain theory about pronouns-that I assumed was aroused in your mind by the sentences that preceded it. In other words, pronouns do not signify objects or words; instead, they represent conceptions, ideas, or activities that the speaker assumes are going on inside the listener's mind. But how can the listener tell which one of the activities is signified when there are several possibilities? \"Do you remember the ring lone liked?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good. Please buy it and give it to her.\" How do we know that \"her\" means |ane and that \"it\" means the ring-and not the other way around? We can tell that \"her\" is not the ring because English grammar usually restricts the pronoun \"her\" to apply only to a female person-though it could also mean an animal, a country, or a ship. But you would know that \"it\" means \"the ring\" in any case, because your Buy agency would not accept the thought of buying fane, nor would your agency for Give accept the thought of giving gifts to rings. If someone said, \"Buy f ane and give her to that ring,\" both Buy and Give would have such strong conflicts that the problem would ascend to the listener's higher-level agencies, which would react with disbelief. Our language often uses pronounlike words to refer to mental activities-but we do not do this only in language: it happens in all the other higher-level functions of our minds. Later we'll see how Find will find a block-rather than, say, a toy giraffe-even though Builder has only said\"find.\" The trick is that Find will use whichever description happens to be available in its current context. Since it's already working for Builder, its subagents will assume that it should find a building-block. Whenever we talk or think, we use pronounlike devices to exploit whatever mental activities have already been aroused, to interlink the thoughts already active in the mind. To do this, though, we need to have machinery we can use as temporary \"handles\" for taking hold of, and moving around, those active fragments of mental states. To emphasize the analogy with the pronouns of our languages, I'll call such handles \"pronomes.\" The next few sections speculate about how pronomes work. T R A I V S . F R A M E S 217\n2I .2 PRONOMES Why are sentences- so easy to understand? How do we compress our ideas into words and, later, get them out again? Typically, an English sentence is built around a represents some sort of act, event, or change: lack drove from Boston to New york on the turnpike with Mary. As soon as you hear such a thing, parts of your mind become engaged with these sorts of concerns related to driving: strings of verb that These concerns and \"roles\" seem so important that every language has developed special word-forms or grammatical constructions for them . How do we know who drove the car? We know that it's \"lack\"-because the Actor comes before the verb. How do we know (t c(tr w(rs involved? Because that is the default Vehicle for \"driv e.\" When did alt this happen? Inthe past -because the verb drive has the form dr-o-ve. Where did the iourney start and end? We know that those places are Boston and New York, respectively, because in English the prepositions fl\"y and fo precede the Origin and Destination. But we often use the *-\" prepositions for different kinds of concerns. In the sentence about driving, \"from\" and \"to\" ,\"f.r'to places in space. But in the sentence below they refer to intervals of time: He ch.anged the liquid from water to wine. The liquid has changed its composition from what it was \"at\" some previous time. In English we use prepositions like \"from,\" \"to,\" and \"at\" both for places in space and for momenls in time. This is not an accident, sinc e representing both space and time in similar w(rys lets us ab\\ly the selfsdme redsoning skills to both of them. Thus, many of our language-grammar \"rules\" embody or reflect some systematic correspondences-and these are among our most powerful ways to think. Many other language-forms have evolved similarly to make it easy for us to formulate, and communicate, our most significant concerns. The next few ,\"\"iion, discuss how the \"pronomes\" we mentioned earlier could be involved in processes we use to make both verbal and nonverbal \"chains of reasonirrg.\" 218 T R A I V S . F R A M E S\n2I.3 TRAfiS-FRAMES Whenever we consider an action, such as moving from one place to another, we almost always have particular concerns like these: Where does the action start? Where does it endT What instrument is used? What is ifs purpose or goalT What are its effects? What difference will it make? We could represent several of these questions with a simple diagram, which we'll call the Trans-frame. O R I G I N DIFFERENCE DESTINATION In the early 1970s, Roger Schank developed ways to represent many situations in terms of a relatively few kinds of relations which he called \"conceptual dependencies.\" One of these, called P-Trans, represents a physical motion from one place to another. Another, called M- Trans, represents the sort of mental transportation involved when John tells Mary his telephone number; some information \"moves\" from fohn's memory to Mary's memory. A third type of conceptual dependency, called A-Trans, represents what is involved when Mary buys fohn's house. The house itself doesn't move at all, but its \"ownership\" is transferred from |ohn's estate to Mary's estate. But why should we want to represent, in the same way, three such different ideas: transpor- tation in space , trdnsmission of ideas, and transfer of ownership? I suspect that it is for the same reason that our language uses the same word fragment trans for all of them: this is one of those pervasive, systematic cross-realm correspondences that enables us to apply the same or similar mental skills to many different realms of thought. For example, suppose you were to drive first from Boston to New York, and then from New York to Washington. Obviously the overall effect would be equivalent to driving from Boston to Washington-but that wouldn't be so \"obvious\" unless you used a certain kind of mental chaining skill. Similarly, if fohn told you his phone number, and you then told it to Mary, this would end up much as though fohn had told Mary directly. And if you first bought |ohn's house and then sold it to Mary, the net result, again, would be as though Mary had bought it directly from |ohn. All three forms of Trans- frames can be used in chains! This means that once you learn efficient chain-manipulating skills, you can apply them to many different kinds of situations and actions. Once you know how to do it, constructing mental chains seems as easy as stringing beads. All you have to do is replace each Trans-frame's Destination with the next one's Origin.

Then how could Gef know what to get-in order to find an apple rather than a block, a fork, or a paper doll? To examine this problem, we'll have to make some assumptions about what happens in a listener's mind. For the moment, let's simply assume that the result is to activate a Builder-like society with these ingredients: GET .^ FIND \\ n \\__ / \\ GRASP / \\ aPPre LOOK-for MOVE-arm-to L apple apple location At first sight, it seems as though all these agents are involved with the apple and the pail. But a closer look shows only the low-level agents Look-for and Grasp are actually concerned with the physical aspects of actual objects; all the others are merely \"middle-level managers.\" For example, the agent Gef doesn't actually \"get\" anything; it only turns on Find and Grasp at the proper time. To be sure, Look-for rvill need some information about what to look for-that is, about an apple's appearance, and Move will need information about the apple's actual location. Nevertheless, we'll see that this information can become available to those agents without any need for messages from Get. To see how agents can operate without explicit messages, let's compare two ordinary language descriptions of how to put an apple into a pail. Our first script mentions each object explicitly in every line, the way one might speak to a novice. Look for an apple. Move the arm and hand to the apple's location. Prepare the hand to grasp an apple-shaped obiect. Grasp the apple. Now look for the pail. Move the arm and hand to the pail's location. Release the hand's grip on the apple. Now let's rewrite this description in a style more typical of normal speech. Look for an apple. Move the arm and hand ta its location. Prepare the hond to grosp an obiect of thot shope. Grasp it. Now look for the pail. Move the arm and hand to its location. Release the hand's griP. This second script uses the words \"apple\" and \"pail\" only once. This is how we usually speak; once something has been mentioned, we normally don't use its name again. Instead, whenever possible, we replace a name by a pronoun word. In the next few sections I'll argue that it is not bnly in language that we replace things with pronounlike tokens; we also do this in many other forms of thought. It could scarcely be otherwise, because in order to make sense to us, our sentences must mirror the structures and methods we use for managing our memories. IFANS A 220 T R A I V S - F R A M E S\n2I.5 AUTOMATISM How do higher-level agencies tell lower-level agents what to do? We might expect this prob- lem to be harder for smaller agencies because they can understand so much less. However, smaller agencies also have fewer concerns and hence need fewer instructions. Indeed, the smallest agencies may need scarcely any messages at all. For example, there's little need to tell Get, Put, or Find what to \"get,\" \"prt,\" or \"find\"-since each can exploit the outcome of the Look-for agency's activity. But how can Loak-for know what to look for? We'll see the answer in a trick that makes the problem disappear. In ordinary life this trick is referred to by names like \"expectation\" or \"context. \" Whenever someone says a word like \"apple,\" you find yourself peculiarly disposed to \"notice\" any apple in the present scene. Your eyes tend to turn in the direction of that apple, your arm will prepare itself to reach out in that direction, and your hand will be disposed to form the corresponding grasping shape. This is because many of your agencies have become immersed in the \"context\" produced by the agents directly involved with whatever subiect was mentioned recently. Thus, the polyneme for the word \"apple\" will arouse certain states of agencies that represent an object's color, shape, and size, and these will automatically affect the Look-for agency-simply because that agency must have been formed in the first place to depend upon the states of our obiect-description agencies. Accordingly, we can assume that Look-for is part of a larger society that includes connections like these: This diagram portrays an automatic \"finding machine. \" Whether an apple was actually seen, imagined, or suggested by naming it, the agents for Color, Shape, and Size will be set into states that correspond to \"red, round, and apple-sized.\" Accordingly, when Look-for becomes active, it cannot help but seek an object with those properties. Then, according to our diagram, once such a thing is found, its locationwill automatically be represented by the state of\"n agency called Place-again, because this is the environment within which Look-for grew. The same must be true of the agency Move-arm-fo, which must also have grown in the context of some location-representing agency like Place. So when Move-arm-fo is aroused, it will automatically tend to move the arm and hand toward that location without needing to be told. Thus, such an arrangement of agencies can carry out the entire apple-moving script with virtually no \"general- purpose\" communication at all. This could be one explanation of what we call \"focus of mental attention.\" Because the agency that represents locations has a limited capacity, whenever some obfect is seen or heard -or merely imagined-other agencies that share the same representation of location are likely to be forced to become engaged with the same object. Then lhir b\"\"omes the momentarv \"iti' of one's immediate concern. APPLE.NEME MOVE. A R M . TO T N A ' V S . F R A M E S\n2I .6 TRA.ilIS.FRAME PRONOIfES Our first Trans-frame scheme was connected to only four pronomes-Origin, Destination, Difference, andTraiectory. These are just enough to link together a simple chain of reasoning. But what about all the other roles that things can play-like Actors, Recipients,Vehicles, Goals, Obstacles, and lnstruments? In order to keep track of these, we surely need some other pro- nomes, too. So now we shall imagine a larger kind of Trans-frame scheme that engages, all at once, a much larger constellation of different pronome roles. ,, , ,, .,,,,i,, ,.lEFFECr,, ,,, ,,, .,,.,.,,, \": 9144l,tGE OF' LOi AAT PN . , . .

Because I suspect thatTrans-like structures have a special prominence in how we think. One reason is that some sort of bridgelike scheme seems indispensable for making those all-important connections be- tween structures and functions. Without that bridge trajectory, it might be hard to connect what we learn about things to what we learn about using them. Also, in order to use chainlike thinking skills, we need to be able to represent what we know in ways that provide connection points for roles like Orig ins, Destinations, and Differences. All these requirements suggest the use of bridgelike frames. One might wonder if we need to use any \"standard\" representations at all. The answer is that we do, indeed, if only because of the Investment principle. No matter what kind of representa- tions we adopt, there's nothing we could do with them until we also learn effective skills and memory-scripts that work with them. And since such complex skills take time to grow, we'd never have enough time to learn new sets of representations for every different new idea. No powerful skills would ever emerge without some reasonably uniform schemes for representing knowledge. Trans-like representation-schemes have been very useful in Artificial Intelligence research projects. They have been useful, among other things, for making theories of problem solving, ior'making \"i.u.r computer programs to simulate \"expertise\" in various specialties, and for making progr\"-s that ,tndetsiand languagelike expressions to limited degrees. In the next few sectioris^*.Il see how to use them for making several different kinds of \"chains of reasoning.\" 222 T N A T V S - F R A M E S\n2I .7 GENERATIZING WITH PRONOMES From every moment to the next, a person's state of mind is involved with various objects, topics, goals, and scripts. When you hear the words of the sentence , \"Put the apple in the pail,\" somehow this causes the subjects of \"apple,\" \"pail\" and \"putting in\" to \"occupy your mind.\" Later we'll speculate about how these become assigned to appropriate roles. Here, to make the story short, let's just assume that at a certain point the language-agency interprets the verb \"put\" to activate a certainTrans-frame and to assign the apple-neme to the Obiect pronome of that Trans-frame. The automatic \"finding machine\" described earlier then assigns the apple's location to the Origin pronome. Similarly, the pail's location is assigned to the Desf ination pronome. (As for the lnstrumenf pronome, this is assigned to the listener's hand by default.) Now each entity \"on the listener's mind\" is represented by one or another pronome assignment. We're almost done, except that in order to actually perform the imagined action, we need some kind of control process to activate the proper agencies in the proper sequence! Activate apple-neme, Look-for, and Move. Then octiyate Grasp. Activate pail-neme, Look-fo4 and Move. Then activate Ungrasp. This suggests a way to learn a skill. The first few times you try to do something new? voll must experiment to find which agents to activate, and at what times, and for how long. Later, you can prepare a script that will do the job more quickly and easily by accumulating memories of which agent-activations were successful, together with memories of which polvnemes were assigned to various pronomes at those moments. For example, if you were to-\"piay back\" the \"Trdns-script\" shown above, your arm would find and put a second apple in that pail-without invoking any higher-level agencies at alll However, this script has a dreadful limitation: it will work only to put apples into pails. What if you later wished to put a block into a box or a spoon into a bowl? We could do that by dividing the process into two scripts: a \"pronome-assignmept script\" and an \"action script. \" Assignment Script: Assign the apple-neme to the Origin pronome. Assign the pail-neme to the Destination pronome. Action Script: Activate origin. Then turn on Look-for, Move, and Grasp. Activate Destination. Then turn on Look-for, Move, and (Jngrasp. Now notice that the action script never actually mentions the apple or pail at all but refers only to the pronomes that represent them. Thus the same action script will serve as well for putting a block into a box as for putting an apple into a paill T R A ^ I V S . F R A M E S 223\n2I .8 ATTENTION When several obiects move at once, it's hard to keep track of them all. This also seems to be the case in every other realm of thought; the more things we think about, the harder it is to pay attention to them all. We're forced to focus on a fe* while losing track oi\"ll the rest. What causes these phenomena? I'll argue that they're aspects of the processes we use to control our short-term memories. These skills develop over time; an aduli can do things with memories that infants cannot do at all, such as remembering details of an action's purpose and trajectory, and how various obstacles were overcome. An infant, though, can baretv keep track of what it's holding in one hand and is likely to forget what's in its othe\"r hand. How does memory-control begin? Perhaps our infants first acquire control over a single pronome, which gives them the ability to keep in mind a \"temporary polyneme. \" This amounts to being able to-maintain only a single \"object of attention\"; lei's cali ii ff. Now even the ability to keep track of a sin_gle IT requires the development of certain skills of memory-control, for it takes the normal infant several months to become able to tolerate even , r-rll interruption without losing its previous focus of interest. One kind of interruption comes, for example, when watching a ball that happens to roll behind a box. To a very young infant, that IT will simply disapp\"\"i fro* mind. ,t\" blaet infant will remember IT and expect the ball soon to reappear; we can see this in the way the older infant's eyes look toward the far side of the box. If the ball does not soon ,.rpp.\"i, the older child will actively reach around the box for it, which shows that the child has maintained some sort of representation of IT. Another variety of interruption can come from inside the child's own mind, from refocusing on the same object, but at a different level of detail. For example, when a young child concentrates upon a doll's shoe, it may forget its original concern withlhe doll itself. Later, that concern with the shoe may be replaced, in turn, when the baby becomes occupied with the end of the shoelace. But what's an IT? The ability to focus attention could start with some machinery for keeping track of simple polynemes for object-things. In later stages, an IT could represent more com- plex processes or scripts that keep track of entire Trans-actions with their various pronomes for Obiects, Origins, Destinations, Obstacles, Traiectories, and Purposes. Eventually our ITs de- velop into complex systems of machinery that represent the things that are \"on one's mind\" at the moment. In later life, we become more able to maintain several ITs at once. This enables us to construct comparisons, predictions, and imaginary plans, and to begin to construct expla- nations in terms of chains of causes and reasons. 224 T R A . i l I S - F R A M E S\nCHAPTER 22 EXPRESSION Henri finally cdme to the conclusion that the book owed its success simply to misunderstandings. Lambert believed he had meant to exalt individualism through collective action, and Lechaume, on the other hand, believed it preached the sacrifice of the individual to collectivism. Everyone emphasized the book's moral character. And yet Henri . . . had thought of a mdn and of a situation, of a certain relationship between that mdn's past life and the crisis through which he was passing, and of a great many other things which none of the critics had mentioned. Was it his fault or the readers'? The public, Henri was forced to conclude, had liked a completely different book from the one he believed he was offering them. - S r M o N E D E B s a u v o r R\n22.I PRONOMES AND POTYNEMES To represent the action \"Pttt the appte in the pail,\" the Originpronome must be assigned to an apple-neme' and the Destinatlon pronome to a polyrrerrre for pail. However, at another time, another process might need the Origin to r.pr\"r.rrt a bloci and the Destination to represent a tower top. Each pronome must be assigned to different things at different times, and only for long enough to complete the task of the moment. In other words, a pronome is a type of short-term memory. This suggests a simple way to embody the idea of a pronome: each pronome is simply a \"temporary K-line.\" The basic difference, then, between a pronom. rtrd a K-line is thai a pronome's connections are temporary rather than permanent. We can \"assi gn\" a prorro-. by temporarilv connecting it to whichever currently active agents it reaches. Then, when we \"activate\" that pronome again, those same agents will be aroused. To make the Origin pronome represent an apple, first activate an apple-neme; this will arouse certain agents. Next, quickly \"assign\" the Origln pronome. Those agents will then become attached to that pronome and presumably remain attached until the pronome is reassigned. If we compare pronomes and polynemes from this point of view, we see that they are closely related. Polynemes dre permanent K-Iines. They are long-term memories. Pronomes dre temporary K-lines. They are short-term memories. It is not yet known today how brains form long-term memories. One hypothesis would be that we don't really have temporary K-lines at all, but that after a pronome's K-line is used, it becomes permanent, and the pronome machinery gets connected to another, previously un- used K-line. However this works, we know little about it except that it requires a substantial amount of time to form a permanent memory-a time on the order of half an hour. If there is any serious disturbance in that interval, no memory will be formed. There also is some evidence that we can form new long-term memories at rates on the order of no more than perhaps one every few seconds, but this is very imprecise because we have no good definition of what we mean by separate memories. In any case, this seems to suggest that we might have several hundred such processes going on at once. Why does the process take so long? Perhaps because it simplv takes that long to synthesize chemicals used to make permanent connection bridges between agents. Perhaps most of that time is consumed in searching for an unused K-line agent, particularly for one that already has the required potential connections. Or perhaps the required connections could emerge frorn \"distributed memories\" like those we mentioned brieflv in section 20.9. 226 E X P R E S S I O N\n22.2 ISONOMES We introduced the concept of a polyneme to explain how an agent could communicate with many other kinds of agencies. In order for a polyneme to work, each of its recipients must learn its own way to react. Now we've seen a second way, for a pronome is also an agent that can interact with many other agencies. The difference is that a pronome has essentially the sdme effect on each of its recipients-namely, to activate or to assign a certain short-term memory- unit. I'll introduce a new word-\"i5sn61ps\"-fsr any agent that has this sort of uniform effect on many agencies. An isonome has a similar, built-in effect on each of its recipients. It thus applies the same idea to mdny different things at once. A polyneme has different, learned effects on each of its recipients. It thus connects the same thing to many different ideas. Why should isonomes exist at all? Because our agencies have common genetic origins, they tend also to be architecturally similar. So they'll tend to lie in roughly parallel formalions like the pages of a book, operate in generally similar ways, and have similai memory-control pro- cesses. Then any agent whose connections tend to run straight through the pages of that book from cover to cover will tend to have similar effects on all of them. Both isonomes and polynemes are involved with memories-but polynemes are essentially the memories themselves, while isonomes control how memories are used. Pronomes are a particular type of isonome; there must also be \"interruption isonomes\" that work similarly but manage memories on larger scales-for example, for storing away the several pronome memo- ries of an entire Trans-frame all at once. (We'll see how ro-\"ihing like this must be done whenever we encounter a grammar word like \"who\" or \"which.\") Ye[other types of isonomes must be involved whenever an agent is used to control the level-band of activity in another agency without concern for all the fine details of what happens inside that agency. So the power of polynemes stems from how they learn to arous\" -rny different pro\"Jrr\"s at once, while isonomes draw their power from exploiting abilities that are already common to many agencies. E X P R E S S I O N 227\n22.3 DE.SPECIALIANG Soon after learning how to put an apple into a pail, a child will discover that it now can put the apple into a box or put an onion into the pail. What magic tricks allow us to \"de-spec iali'ze\" whatever skills we learn? We've already seen one way to do this simply by replacing certain polynemes with less specific isonomes. For example, our first apple-inio-pail proced.ri. rr, ,o specialized that it could be used only to put apples into pails-because it ii based on using specific polynemes for those obiects. However, the second script just as easily puts onions into pails or umbrellas into suitcases, because it engages no polynemes at all, but only the Origin and Destination pronomes. This script is more versatile because those pronomes can beLs- signed to anythingl, Learning to think in terms of isonomes must be a crucial step in many types of mental growth. None of our many chaining tricks would have much use if each were permanently tied to one specific polyneme like \"owl\" or \"car\" or \"cup\" or \"gear.\" However, once we learn to build our process scripts with isonomes, each can be applied to many kinds of reasoning-to logic, cause, dependenCy, and all the rest. But changing polynemes to isonomes will not always work. What could keep a child from trying to apply the script that works on \"put the apple in the block\" to \"put the ocean in the cup\"? To prevent such absurdities, our script must also place appropriate constraints on the Origin and Desf ination-for example, to ensure that the Desti- nation must represent a containerlarge enough to hold the Origin thing, and that the container be open toward the top. If all this seems too obvious to say, just watch a baby's first attempts to put an object in a pail or pick up food with a spoon or a fork. It takes many weeks or months of work to bring such skills to the point of usefulness. If we generalize too recklessly by changing all our polynemes to isonomes, few of our generalizations will actually work. What we call \"generalizing\" is not any single process or concept, but a functional term for the huge societies of different methods we use to extend the powers of our skills. No single policy will work for all domains of thought, and each refinement of technique will affect the quality of the generalizations we make. Converting polynemes to isonomes may be a potentially powerful skill, but it must be adapted to different realms. Once we accumulate enough exam- ples of how a new script fails and succeeds in several situations, we can try to build a uniframe to embody good constraints. But no matter which policy we adopt, we must always expect some exceptions. You cannot carry birds in pails, no matter how well they fit inside. Premature generalizations could lead to such large accumulations of constraints, censors, and exceptions that it would be better to retain the original polynemes. 228 E X P R E S S I O N\n22.4 TEARNING AND TEACHING One frustration every teacher knows arises when a child learns a subject well enough to pass a test, yet never puts that skill to use on problems met in \"real life. \" It doesn't often help to scold but it sometimes helps to explain, through examples, how to apply the concept to other contexts. Why do some children seem to do this for themselves, automatically and sponta- neously, while others seem to have to learn essentially the same thing over and over in different domains? Why are some children better than others at \"transfer of learning\" from one domain to another? It doesn't explain anything to say that those children are \"smarter,\" \"brighter,\" or \"more intelligent.\" Such vaguely defined capacities vary greatly even among different parts of the same mind. The power of what we learn depends on how we represent it in our minds. We've seen how the same experience can lead to learning different action scripts by replacing certain polynemes with isonomes. Certain of those versions will apply only to specific situations, others will apply to many more situations, and yet others will be so general and vague as to lead only to confu- sion. Some children learn to represent knowledge in versatile ways; others end up with accu- mulations of inflexible, single-purpose procedures or with almost useless generalities. How do children acquire their \"representation skills\" in the first place? An educational environment can lead a child to build large, complicated processes from smaller ones by laying out sequences of steps. Good teachers know what size to make each step and can often suggest analogies to help the child's mind to use what it already knows for building larger scripts and processes. By making each step small enough, we can keep the child from getting lost in unfamiliar worlds of meaningless alternatives; then the child will remain able to use previous skills to test and modify the growing new structures. But when a new fragment of knowledge or process constitutes too abrupt a break from the past, then none of the child's old recognizers and action scripts will apply to it; the child will get stuck, and \"transfer of learning\" won't occur. Why are some children better than others at \"teaching themselves\" to make changes inside their minds? Each child learns, from time to time, various better wdys to learn-but no one understands how this is done. We tend to speak about \"intelligence\" because we find it virtually impossible to understand how this is done from watching only what the child does. The problem is that one can't observe a child's strategies for \"learning how to learn\"-lssause those strategies are twice removed from what we can see. It is hard enough to guess the character of the A-brain systems that directly cause those actions. Think how much more difficult it would be for an observer to imagine the multilayer teacher-learner structures that must have worked inside the child to train the A-brain agencies! And that observer has no way at all to guess what crucial \"lucky accidents\" may have led those hidden B-brains to persistent concerns with finding better ways to learn. Perhaps our educational research should be less concerned with teaching chil- dren to acquire particular skills and more concerned with how we learn to learn. E X P R E S S I O N 229\n22,5 INFERENCE Linking structures together into chains is one of our most useful kinds of reasoning. Suppose you learned that \"lohn gdve the kite to Mary\" and then \"Mdry gdye the kite to lack.\" You could then conclude that the kite went from fohn to fack. How do we draw such conclusions? Some people think we use \"logic\" for this. A simpler theory is that we do it by fitting together Trans- frames into chains. Suppose you see two frames like these: Ail A's ,r. B', and All B's ,r. C'r. Then just combine the first Origin with the secondDestination to make this new \"deduction- frame\": All A's ,r. C'r. To do this sort of \"reasoning,\" we have to use our isonomes to rearrange our short-term memories. But this requires more than simple chaining. For example, all older children can infer that Tweety can fly from \"Tweety is a bird\" and \"AIl birds cdn fly.\" To do this, though, one has to deal with a disparity: the first B is \"a bird\" while the second B is \"all birds.\" To be able to make such chains would be virtually useless if we could do it only when both pronome assignments were absolutely identical. Over the years, children improve their abilities to decide when two different structures are similar enough to iustify making chainlinks. This often requires us to recall and apply other types of knowledge at appropriate level-bands of detail. Children take many years to learn effective ways to use their pronomes and isonomes. The youngest ones can neither rearrange their representations of physical scenes nor make the kinds of inference we're discussing here. To think like adults, we must develop and learn to use memory-controlling processes that manipulate several sets of pronome values at the same time. fust such a process was concealed in our simple script for \"Put the apple in the pail\"-which first appears to be merely a matter of assigning \"apple\" to the Origin and \"pail\" to the Destina- tion. But you can't Puf something until you Get it, so this must actually involve two Trans- frame operations. The first is for moving your hand to the apple, and the second is for moving the apple to the pail. During the transition, your pronomes have to change their roles since the apple's location is the Destination of the first Trans, but then becomes the Origin of the second Trans. No matter that this seems too obvious to state; some mental process has to switch that pronome's role. By learning to manipulate our isonomes, we become able to combine mental representations into structures that resemble bridges, chains, and towers. Our language-agencies learn to ex- press these in the form of compound sentences, by using conjunctive grammar words like \"dnd,\" \"becduse,\" o, \"or.\" But language is not the only realm in which we learn to \"conceptual- iyg\"-,1l:rat is, to treat our mental processes almost as though they were object-things. After you solve a hard problem, you may find yourself representing the steps you took as if they were the parts of a physical structure. Doing this can enable you to reassemble them into other forms that achieve the same results with much more speed and much less thought. 230 E X P R E S S I O N\n22.6 EXPRESSION Language lets us treat our thoughts as though they were much like ordinary things. Suppose you meet someone who is trying to solve a problem. You ask what's happening. \"l'm thinking,\" you are told. \"l cdn see that,\" yo,r say, \"but what dre you thinking about?\" \"Well, I was looking for a way to solve this problem, and I think l've iust found one.\" We speak as though ideas resemble building-blocks that one can find and grasp! Why do we \"thing-ify\" our thoughts? One reason is that this enables us to reapply the wonderful machines our brains contain for understanding worldly things. Another thing it does is help us organize our expeditions in the mental world, much as we find our ways through space. Consider how the strategies we use to \"find\" ideas resemble the strategies we use for finding real things: Look in the places they used to be or where they're usually found-but don't keep looking again and again in the same ploce. Indeed, for many centuries our memory- training arts have been dominated by two techniques. One is based on similarities of sounds, exploiting the capacities of our language-agencies to make connections between words. The other method is based on imagining the items we want to remember as placed in some familiar space, such as a road or room one knows particularly well. This way, we can apply our thing- location skills to keeping track of our ideas. Our ability to treat ideas as though they were objects goes together with our abilities to reuse our brain-machinery over and over again. Whenever an agency becomes overburdened by a large and complicated structure, we may be able to treat that structure as a simple, single unit by thing-ifying-or, as we usually say, \"conceptualizing\"-it. Then, once we replace a larger structure by representing it with a compact symbol-sign, that overloaded agency may be able to continue its work. This way, we can build grand structures of ideas-much as we can br-rild great towers from smaller parts. I suspect that, as they're represented in the mind, there's little difference between a physical object and an idea. Worldly things are useful to us because they are \"substantial\"-that is, because their properties are relatively permanent. Now we don't usually think of ideas as substantial, because they don't have the usual properties of worldly things-such as color, shape, and weight. Yet \"good ideas\" must also have substantiality, albeit of a different sort: No conception or idea could have much use unless it could remain unchanged- and stay in some kind of mental \"place\"-fo, long enough for us to find it when we need if. Nor could we ever achieve a goal unless it could persist for long enough. ln short, no mind can work without some stable states or memories. This may sound as though I'm speaking metaphorically, since a mental \"place\" is not exactly like a worldly place. But then, when you think of a place you know, that thought itself is not a worldly place, but only a linkage of memories and processes inside your mind. This wonderful capacity-to think about thoughts as though they were things-is also what enables us to contemplate the products of our thoughts. Without that ability to reflect, we would have no general intelligence-however large our repertoire of special-purpose skills might grow. Of course this same capacity enables us to think such empty thoughts as \"This statement is about itself,\" which is true but useless, or \"This statement is not about itself,\" which is false and useless, or \"This statement is false,\" which is downright paradoxical. Yet the benefit of being able to conceptualize is surely worth the risk that we mav sometimes be nonsensical. E X P R E S S I O N\n22.7 CAUSES AND CI.AUSES For virtually every change we see, we tend to seek some cause. And when we find no cause on the scene, we'll postulate that one exists, even though we might be wrong. We do this so consistently that I wouldn't be surprised to find that brains have built-in tendencies to try to represent all situations in certain special ways: THINGS. Whatever we mdy see or touch, wc represent the scene in terms of separate obiect-things. We do the same for representing processes and mental states. ln langudges, these obiect-symbols tend to correspond to nouns. DIFFERENCES. Whenever we discern a change or iust compare two different things, we represent this as a difference thing. ln langudges, these often corre- spond to verbs. CAUSES. Wheneyer we conceive of an action, change, or difference, we try to ossign d cduEe to it-thot is, some other person, process, or thing that we can hold to be responsible for it. ln languages, cduses often take the forms of things. CLAUSES. Whatever structures we conceive are dealt with like single things. ln languages, this corresponds to treating an entire phrase as though it were a single word. In English, almost every sentence form demands some sort of Actor noun-and I think this reflects the need to find a motive or a cause. Consider how we place that lt in \"Soon it will begin to rain.\" We're always chopping complex situations into artificially clear-cut chunks which we perceive as separate things. Then we notice various differences and relationships among those parts and assign them to various parts of speech. We string our words into clauses and our clauses into chains, often interrupting one by inserting fragments of others inside it, yet proceeding as though there were no interruptions at all. It has been alleged that the construction of such structures is unique to the grammar-machinery of language, but I suspect that languages evolved those forms because of mechanisms deeper in the grain of how we think. For example, when we talked about visual ambiguity, we saw that our vision-systems are highly proficient at representing structures that interrupt one another. This suggests that both our visual and linguistic abilities to deal with \"interruptions\" could be based on similar methods with which we \"manage\" what is represented in our short-term memories. In any case, our brains appear to make us seek to represent dependencies. Whatever hap- pens, where or when, we're prone to wonder who or what's responsible. This leads us to discover explanations that we might not otherwise imagine, and that helps us predict and control not only what happens in the world, but also what happens in our minds. But what if those same tendencies should lead us to imagine things and causes that do not exist? Then we'll invent false gods and superstitions and see their hand in every chance coincidence. Indeed, perhaps that strange word \"1\"-6s used in \"f iust had a good ifls4\"-1eflects the selfsame tendency. If you're compelled to find some cause that causes everything you do-why, then, that something needs a name. You call lt\"me.\" I call it\"yott.\" 232 E X P R E S S I O N\n22.8 INTERRTIPTIONS What enables us to tolerate an interruption and then return to our previous thoughts? This must engage the agents that control our short-term memories. It is important also to recognize that many interruptions come not only from outside, but also from inside the mind. For example, all but the simplest discourses make interruptions in the trains of thought they start. Consider this sentence: The thief who took the moon moved it to Paris. We can regard this as expressing one thought that is interrupted by another. The principal intention of the speaker is to express this Trans-ftame: The thief moved the moon (from7) to Paris. Actor Trans Obiect Origin Destination The speaker, realizing that the listener may not know who the thief was, interrupts the main sentence with a \"relative clause\"-\"v1fts took the 7ns6n\"-to further describe that Actor thief. As it happens, this interrupting clause also has the form of a Trans-frame-so now the lan- guage-agency must deal with two such frames at once. Who took the moon (from7) (toZ) Actor Trans Obiect Origin Destination English tends to use certain wh words, like \"which\" and \"who,\" to interrupt a listener's language-agency and cause its short-term memories to temporarily store away some of their present pronome assignments. This provides the language-agency with more capacity to under- stand the interrupting phrase. In the case of the moon sentence, the word \"who\" instructs the listener to prepare to elaborate the description of the Actor thief. Once this is done, the language-agency can \"re-member\" its previous state in the process of understanding the main sentence. We can often tell when to use an interruption process even though the initial wh word is missing; however, this doesn't always work so well: The cotton clothing is made of is grown in the south. This sentence is confusing because the reader tends to treat the word \"cotton\" in \"cotton clothing\" as an adjective that modifies \"clothing,\" when the writer meant it as a noun. The same sentence is easier to understand when set in alarger context: Where do people grow the cotton that is used to make clothing? --- The cotton clothing is made of is grown in the south. The first sentence activates the noun sense of \"cotton\" and asks a question about that subf ect. Now a question is really a sort of command: it makes the reader focus attention on a certain subiect. Here, it prepares the reader to add more structure to the representation of the cotton noun, so there is less need for an explicit interruption signal. Still, it is very curious how rarely we bother to use any signal at all for marking the end of an interrupting phrase. We never say a word that means \"un-who. \" Evidently, we're usually ready to assume that the interrupting phrase is complete. E X P R E S S I O N\n22.9 PRONOUNS AND REFERENCES We sometimes think of words like \"who\" or \"tt\" as \"pronouns\"-1trat is, signals that represent or substitute for other nouns or phrases. But as we've seen, pronouns don't refer to words so much as to partial states that are active in the listener's mind. In order to \"refer\" to such an activity, the listener must assign it to some short-term memory-unit-that is, to some pronome. However, communication will fail unless the listener can correctly guess which pronome the speaker wishes to assign to that activity. This can be a problem when there is more than one available choice. For example, consider the pronoun \"if\" in the following sentence: The thief who took the moon moved it to Paris. How does the listener understand that it must mean the moon? English grammar constrains the choice it cannot be assigned to the thief because lf cannot refer to a person at all. (We apologize to all the small children we have called \"it\" in this book.) But grammar alone can't determine the choice, since \"it\" could also mean the sun, as it does in this little dialogue: Good grief; what's happened to the sunT Oh, thot! The thief who took the moon moved it to Paris. The way \"it\" works is not so much grammatical as psychological. The expression \"moved it\" causes the listener's language-agencies to seek a pronome that represents something that could have been moved. This could be either the sun or the moon. But the previous question , What happened to the sun? has already prepared the listener to expect to hear about an action whose Obiect pronome represents the sun, just as our earlier question about cotton made the listener anticipate an answer concerning that topic. Furthermore, the new phrase, \"The thief . . . moved if,\" fulfills this expectation by activating a Trans-frame whose Actor and Action pro- nomes already have assignments; this frame requires only an Obiecf to be complete. So the word \"it\" is perfectly suited to fill the role of \"sun\" in that unassignedObiecf slot. What does \"expectation\" mean? At each point in a dialogu€, both parties are already involved with various concerns and desires. These establish contexts in which each new word, descrip- tion, or representation, however ambiguous, gets merged with whichever short-term memory best matches it. Why do we make such assignments so quickly, instead of waiting until all the ambiguities are resolved? That is a practical matter. Our language-agencies must dispose of each phrase as soon as possible, so that they can apply their full capacities to deal with what \"o*\"i afterward. If something in the conversation does not match anything that came before, the listener must activate a new memory-unit. This tends to slow the process down, because it consumes our limited supplies of short-term memory and makes subsequent matching more difficult. If the listener cannot make suitable assignments quickly enough, the conversation will seem incoherent and communication will break down. Eloquent speakers avoid this by designing each new expression to be easily attached to structures already active in the listener; otherwise the listener is entitled to complain that the language isn't clear. A speaker can also indicate which subjects have not been mentioned yet, to spare the listener from struggling to make a nonexistent match; we use expressions like \"by the way\" to tell the listen er not to attach what comes next to any presently active pronome. To do such things, the speaker must anticipate some of what is happening inside the listener's mind. The next section describes a way of doing this-by using the speaker's own mind as a model and assuming that the listener will be similar. 234 E X P R E S S I O N\n22.IO \\TERBAI EX?RESSION How easily people can communicate. We listen and speak without the slightest sense of what's involved! One of us expresses an idea, the other understands it, and neither thinks anything complicated has happened; it seems as natural to talk as it is to walk. Yet both simplicities are illusions. To walk, you must engage a vast array of agencies to move your body down the street. To talk, you must engage a vast array of agencies to build new structures in another person's mind. But how do you know just what to say to affect that other person's agencies? Let's suppose that Mary wants to tell fack something. This means there is a certain structure p somewhere inside the network of Mary's agencies-and that Mary's language-agency must construct a similar structure inside fack's mind. To do this, Mary will need to speak words that will activate appropriate activities inside |ack's agencies, then correctly link them together. How can she do that? Here is what we'll call the \"re-duplication\" theory of how we formulate what we say: Mary proceeds, step by step, to construct a new version of p-call it q-inside her own mind. In doing this, she will apply various memory-control operations to activate certain isonomes and polynemes. As Mary performs each internal operation, her speech-agency selects certain cone- sponding verbal expressions-and these cause similar operations to occur inside lack. As a result, Iack builds a structure similar to q. To be able to do that, Mary must have learned at least one expressiye technique that corresponds to each frequently used mental operation And fack must have learned to recognize those expressive techniqus5-147s'll call them grdmmdr- tactics-and to use them to activate some corresponding isonomes and poly- nemes. To build her new version of p, Mary could employ a goal-achieving scheme: she keeps comparing p with the latest version of q, and whenever she senses a significant difference, she applies some operation to q that removes or reduces the difference. For example, if Mary notices that p has an Origin pronome where q lacks one, her memory-control system will focus on p's Origin. In this case, if p itself is a motion frame, the usual speech-tactic is to use the word \"from.\" Next she must describe the substructure attached to p's Origin pronome. If this were a simple polyneme like \"Boston,\" Mary's speech-agency could simply pronounce the corresponding word. But if that pronome is assigned to some more complicated structure, such as an entire frame, Mary's language-agency must interrupt itself to copy that. This is expressed, as we have seen, by using words like \"who\" or \"which.\" In any case, Mary continues this difference-duplication process until she senses no significant discrepancies between q and p. Of course, what Mary finds significant depends on what she \"wants to say. \" This \"re-duplication\" theory of speech describes only the first stages of how we use language. In later stages, the mental operations we use to construct q are not always immediately applied to pronouncing words. Instead, we learn techniques for storing sequences of grammar-tactics temporarily; this makes it possible to modify and rearrange our words and sentences before we say them. Learning these arts takes a long time: most children need a decade or more to complete their language-systems and many keep learning, throughout their lives, to sense new sorts of discrepancies and discover ways to express them. E X P R E S S I O N\n22.11 CREATTVE EXPRESSION There is a wonderful capacity that comes along with the ability to \"express\" ideas. Whatever we may want to say, we probably won't say exactly that. But in exchange, there is a chance of saying something else that is both good and new! After all, the \"thing we want to say\"-the structure p we're trying to describe-is not always a definite, fixed structure that our language- agents can easily read and copy. If p exists at all, it's likely to be a rapidly changing network involving several agencies. If so, then the language-agency may only be able to make guesses and hypotheses about p and try to confirm or refute them by performing experiments. Even if p were well defined in the first place, this very process is liable to change it, so that the final version q won't be the same as the original structure p. Sometimes we call this process \"thinking in words. \" In other words, whether or not what you \"meant\" to say actually existed before you spoke, your language-agencies are likely either to reformulate what did exist or create something new and different from anything you had before. Whenever you try to express with words any complicated mental state, you're forced to oversimplify-and that can cause both loss and gain. On the losing side, no word description of a mental state can ever be complete; some nuances are always lost. But in exchange, when you're forced to separate the essences from accidents, you gain the opportunity to make reformulations. For example, when stuck on a problem, you may \"say to yourself\" things like \"Now, Iet's see-iust what was I reolly trying to occomplish?\" Then, since your language-agency knows so little about the actual state of those other agencies, it must answer such questions by making theories about them, and these may well leave you in a state that is simpler, clearer, and better suited to solving your problem. When we try to explain what we think we know, we're likely to end up with something new. All teachers know how often we understand something for the first time onlv after trying to explain it to someone else. Our abilities to make language descriptions can engage all our other abilities to think and to solve problems. If speaking involves thinking, then one must ask, \"How much of ordinary thought involves the use of words?\" Surely many of our most effective thinking methods scarcely engage our language-agencies at all. Perhaps we turn to words only when other methods fail. But then the use of language can open entirely new worlds of thought. This is because once we can represent things in terms of strings of words, it becomes possible to use them in a boundless variety of ways to change and rearrange what happens in our other agencies. Of course, we never realize we're doing this; instead we refer to such activities by names like paraphrase or change of emphasis, as though we weren't changing what we're trying to describe. The crucial thing is that during the moments in which those word-strings are detached from their \"meanings,\" they are no longer subfect to the constraints and limitations of other agencies, and the language-systems can do what they want with them. Then we can transmit, from one person's brain to another, the strings of words our grammar-tactics produce, and every individual can gain access to the most successful formulations that others can artic- ulate. This is what we call culture-the conceptual treasures our communities accumulate through history. 236 E X P N E S S I O N\nCHAPTER 23 COMPARISONS What, in effect, dre the conditions for the construction of formal thought? The child must not only aqqly operations to obiects-in other words, mentally execute possible actions on the:m-he must also \"reflect\" those operations in the absence of the obiects which are replaced by pure propositions. Thus \"reflection\" is thought raised to the second power. Concrete thinking is the representation of a possible action, and formal thinking is the representation of a representation of possible action. . . . h is not surprising, therefore, that the system of concrete operations must be completed during the last yeors of childhood before it can be \"reflected\" by formal operations. In terms of their function, formal operations do not differ from concrete operations except that they are apptied to hypotheses or propositions [whose logic is] an abstract translation of the system of \"inference\" that governs concrete oPerations. - f n e N P I A G E T\n23.I A IIfORTD OF DIFFERENCES Much of ordinary thought is based on recognizing differences. This is because it is generally useless to do anything that has no discernible effect. To ask if something is significant is virtually to ask, \"What difference does it make?\" Indeed, whenever we talk about \"cause and effect\" we're referring to imaginary links that connect the differences we sense. What, indeed, are goals themselves, but ways in which we represent the kinds of changes we might like to make? It is interesting how many familiar mental activities can be represented in terms of the differences between situations. Suppose you have in mind two situations A and Z, and D is your description of the difference between them. Suppose also that you are thinking of applying a certain procedure P to the first situation, A. There are several kinds of thinking you might do. -Pro ced u re - / \\ -/ \\ oRf ctN A t -lz DESTTNATTON \\-/ Diff erence PRE DICTING. T o the extent that you can predict how various P's will affect A, you cdn avoid the expense and risk of actually performing those actions. EXPECTING. lf you expect P to produce Z but it actually produces Y, then you can try to explain what went wrong in terms of difference between Y and Z. EXPLAINING. lf actions like P usually lead to differences of type D, then when you obsewe such d D, you cdn suspect that it wds cdused by something like P. WANTING. lf you are in situation A, but wish to be in a situation more like Z, it may help to remember ways to remove or reduce differences like D. ESCAPING, ATTACKING, and DEFENDING. lf P causes a disturbing type of difference D, we cdn try to improve matters by finding some action that counteracts or opposes P. ABSTRACTING. ln many forms of thought, the differences we notice between obiects at each level become the \"obiects\" of our higher-level thoughts. Not only are differences important by themselves; more often than we realize, we think about differences between differences. For example, the \"height\" of a physical object is really a differ- ence between the locations of its top and its bottom. And this means that the higher-level agents in our Societies-of-More must actually deal with differences between differences. For example, the agent Taller has to react to the difference between two heights-but as we've just seen, a height is already a difference between two locations! The ability to consider differences between differences is important because it lies at the heart of our abilities to solve new problems. This is because these \"second-order-differences\" are what we use to remind ourselves of other problems we already know how to solve. Some- times this is called \"reasoning by analogy\" and is considered to be an exotic or unusual way to solve problems. But in my view, it's our most ordinary way of doing things. 238 C O M P A N I S O N S\n23.2 DIFFERENCES AND DTIPIJCATES It is important for us to be able to notice differences. But this seemingly innocent require- ment poses a problem whose importance has never been recognized in psychology. To see the difficuity, let'i return to the subject of mental rearrangements. Let's first assume that the problem is to compare two room-arrangement descriptions represented in two different agen- ti.r, agency A represents a room that contains a couch and a chair; agency Z represents the same room, but with the couch and chair exchanged. Now if both agencies are to represent furniture arrangements in ways that some third agency D can compare, then the \"difference-detecting\" agency D must receive two sets of inputs that match almost perfectly. Otherwise, every other, irrelevant difference between the outputs of A and Z would appear to D to be differences in those rooms-and D would perceive so many spurious differences that the real ones would be indiscernible! The Duplication Problem. The states of two different agencies cannot be com- pared unless those agencies themselves dre virtually identical. But this is only the tip of the iceberg, for it is not enough that the descriptions to be compared emerge from two almost identical agencies. Those agencies must, in turn, receive inputs of near identical character. And for that to come about, each of their subagencies must also fulfill that same constraint. The only way to meet all these conditions is for both agencies -and all the subagencies upon which they depend-to be identical. Unless we find another wdf , we'Il need an endless ftosf of duplicated brains! This duplication problem comes up all the time. What happens when you hear that Mary bought lohn's house? Must you have separate agencies to keep both Mary and lohn in your mind at once? Even that would not suffice, for unless both person-representing agencies had similar connections to all your other agencies, those two representations of \"persons\" would not have similar implications. The same kind of problem must arise when you compare your present situation with some recollection or experience-that is, when you compare how you react to the two different partial states of mind. But to compare those two reactions, what kind of simultaneous machinery would be needed to maintain both momentary personalities? How could a single mind hold room for two-one person old, the other new? C O M P A R I S O N S\n23.3 TII\\fiE BIJNKING Fortunately, there is a way to get around the duplication problem entirely. Let's take a cue from how a perfume makes a strong impression first, but then appears to fade away, or how, when you put your hand in water that is very hot or very cold, the sensation is intense at first- but will soon disappear almost entirely. As we say, we \"get used to\" these sensations. Why? Because our senses react mainly to how things change in time. This is true even for the sensors in our eyes-though normally we're unaware of it because our eyes are always moving imper- ceptibly. Most of the sensory agents that inform our brains about the world are sensitive only to various sorts of time changes-and that, surelv, is also true of most of the agents inside the brain. Any agent that is sensitive to changes in time can also be used to detect differences. For wheneyer we expose such an agent, first to a situation A and then to a situation B, any output from that agent wiII signify some difference between A and B. This suggests a way to solve the duplication problem. Since most agents can be made to serve as difference-agents, we cdn compare two descriptions simply by presenting them to the Edme dgency at different times. This is easily done if that agency is equipped with a pair of high- speed, temporary K-line memories. Then we need only load the two descriptions into those memories and compare them by activating first one and then the other. Store the first description in pronome p. Store the second description in pronome q. Activate p and q in rapid succession. Then any changes in the agents' outputs represent differences between A and B! We can use this trick to implement the scheme we described for escaping from a topless- arch. Suppose that p describes the present situation and q describes a box that permits no escape. Each Move agent is designed to detect the appearance of a wall. If we simply \"blink\" from the present situation to the box frame, one of these agents will announce the appearance of any box wall that was not already apparent in the present situation. Thus, automatically, this scheme will find all the directions that are not closed off. If the outputs of the Move agents were connected to cause you to move in the corresponding direction, this agency would lead you to escape! The method of time blinking can also be used to simplify our difference-engine scheme for composing verbal expressions, since now the speaker can maintain both p and q inside the selfsame agency. If not for this, each speaker would need what would amount to a duplicate society of mind in order to simulate the listener's state. Although the method of time blinking is powerful and efficient, it has some limitations; for example, it cannot directly recognize relations among more than two things at a time. I suspect that people share this limitation, too -and this may be why we have relatively few language-forms, like \"between\" and \"middle,\" for expressing three-way comparisons and relationships. 240 C O M P A R I S O N S\n29.4 THE MEANINGS OF MORE Let's return just one time more to all the things that More can mean. Each usage has a different ,.1r.-- ore powerful; more meaningfut-and each such meaning must be learned. In other words, each use of More involves ^ .orrrr.\"tion with an agent fo_r some adiective' But Moremust also engage some systematic use of isonomes, since all the different meanings share a certain common character. When we hear the word \"more,\" we become disposed to make comparfsons. This suggests that More engages both an accumulation of different meanings and also some systematicJsorromelike effect-. indeed, Morecould exploit our time-blinking mechanism, which aiready uses isonomes to make comparisons. To do that, More would have to activate a mem- ory-control process that \"blinks\" wlrichever pronomes have been assigned to the things to be compared. Then their differences would be computed automatically. More needs two additional ingredients. We'd never ask, all by itself, \"Which one is more, dn apple or a pearz\"-fss2.rr. o,r, general-purpose comparison script woufd _generate difference- descriptions in too many agenciei. We also need to know which kind of difference is of concern at the moment. So we scarcely ever say \"more\" by itself but usually attach some modifier- more red, say, or more expensive. Of course, if our focus of concern is already clear from the context-foi e*a-ple, if it is clear that we want to know whether apples or pears are more expensive-then we need not express this explicitly. Finally, it is one thing to find r diff\"r.nce, but another to know whether to call it \"more\" or \"less.\" Ii -ay seem self-evident that Taller corresponds to \"more,\" andThinner corcesponds to ,.fss5\"-yet that is something we once had to learn. This is the other ingredient of More: we need another polyneme to iay which sorts of differences should be considered positive. In English we someii*.r encode such preferences as choices between pairs of adiectives like \"laige\" and \"small,\" but we do not have pairs of words for concepts such as \"triangular\" or \"red\",\" presumably because we do not think of them as having \"natural\" opposites. Instead, we \"\"r, ,rr\" word-paiis like \"more red\" and \"less triangular.\" We can even modify the words them- selves; we often say \"redder\" or \"rounder\"-fufi for some reason we never say \"triangularer. \" How does one answer a question like \"Wh ich is bigger, a large mouse or d smdll elephant?\" We can't compare two descriptions until we engage enough knowledge to construct suitable representations of them. One way to compare mouse and elephant would be to envision an- ot^her entity of intermediate size. A suitcase would be suitable for this, since it could hold the largest mouse but not the smallest elephant. How do you find such standards for comparison? fhat can take considerable time, during which you have to search your memories for structures that can serve as links for longer chains of comparisons. As life proceeds, each person's concept of More grows more and more elaborate. When it comes to notions like more similar, more interestiig, or \"more difficuh,\" there seems no limit to the complexity of what a word like \"more\" can represent. 24r C O M P A R I S O N S\n23.5 FOREIGN ACCENTS It is not unusual for an adult to learn a second language with nearly perfect mastery of grammar and vocabulary. But once past adolescence, most people never manage to imitate the new language's pronunciation perfectly, no matter how long and hard they work at it. In other words, they speak with \"foreign accents.\" Even when another speaker tries to help with \"Say it Iike this, not thatr\" the learner is unable to learn what changes to make. Most people who change countries in their later teens neyer learn to speak the way the natives do. Why do adults find it so hard to learn how to pronounce new word sounds? Some like to say that this reflects a general decline in the learning capacities of older people, but that appears to be a myth. Instead, I suspect this particular disability is caused, more or less directly, by a genetically programmed mechanism that disables our ability to learn to make new connections in or between the agents we use to represent speech sounds. There is evidence that our brains use different machinery for recognizing language sounds than for recognizing other sorts of sounds, particularly for the little speech-sound units that language scientists call \"phonemes.\" Most human languages use less than a hundred phonemes. Why should we be able to learn many different speech sounds before the age of puberty but find it so much harder to learn new ones afterward? I suspect that this link to puberty is no coincidence. Instead, one or more of the genetically controlled mechanisms that brings on sexual maturity also acts to reduce the capacities of these particular agencies to learn to recog- nize and make new sounds! But why did this peculiar disability evolve? What evolutionary survival advantage would favor individuals whose genes reduce, after that age, this particular ability to learn? Consider this hypothesis: The onset of the childbearing age is the biological moment when a person's social role changes from learner to teacher. The \"evolutiondry purpose\" of suppressing speech-sound learning may simply serve to prevent the parent from learning the child's speech-thus making the child learn the adult's speech instead! Wouldn't parents want to teach the children their language anyway? Not necessarily. In the short run, a parent is usually more concerned with communication than with instruction. Accordingly, if we found it easier to imitate our children's sounds, that's what we'd do. But if parents were inclined and able to learn to speak the ways their children do, those children would lose both incentive and opportunity to learn to speak like adults, and-if every child acquired a different set of language sounds-no common, public language would ever hoye eyolved in the first place! If this is right, puberty-linked genes for suppressing speech-sound learning may have formed fairly early in the evolution of human languages. No one knows when that occurred, but if biologists could find and date the genes for this, we could obtain a clue about the time of language's unknown origin, perhaps within the last half million years. 242 C O M P A R I S O N S\nCHAPTER 24 FRAMES The iustification of Na|oleon's statement-if, indeed, he ever made it-that those who form a picture of everything are unfit to command, is to be found in the first of these defects. A commdnder who approaches a battle with a picture before him of how such and such a fight went on such and such an occasion, will find, two minutes after the forces have ioined, that something has gone dwry.Then his picture is destroyed. He has nothing in reserye except another individual picture, and this also wiII not serye him for long. Or it mdy be that when his first pictured forecast is found to be inapplicable, he has so multifarious and pressing a collection of pictures that equally he is at a loss what practical adiustment to make. Too great individuality of past reference mdy be very nearly as embarrassing ds no individuality of past reference at all To serye adequately the demands of a constantly changing enyironment, we haye not only to pick items out of their general setting, but we must know what parts of them mdy flow and alter without disturbing their general significance and functions. C . B A R T L E T T\n24.1 THE SPEED OF THOUGHT For there exists a great chasm between those, on the one side, who relate everything to o single central vision, one system more or Iess coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel-a single, universal, organizing principle in terms of which olone all that they are ond soy has significance-and, on the other side, those who pursue mdny ends, often unrelated and 'i::,:\";:';!;:i:7;,i:;\":';:,,i;,::,r,i::i\",:::,:,\",\"ir:o or aesthetic princible. . . . - I s A r A H B e n r . r N When we enter a room, we seem to see the entire scene at a glance. But, really, it takes time to see-to apprehend all the details and see if they confirm our expectations and beliefs. Our first impressions often have to be revised. Still, one wonders how so many kinds of visual cues can lead so quickly to consistent views. What could explain the blinding speed of sight? The secret is that sight is intertwined with memory. When face to face with someone you've just met, you seem to react almost instantly-but not as much ta what you see as to what thot sight \"reminds\" you of The moment you sense the presence of a person, a whole world of assumptions are aroused that are usually true about people in general. At the same time, certain superficial cues remind you of particular people you've already met. Unconsciously, then, you will assume that this stranger must also resemble them, not only in appearance but in other traits as well. No amount of self-discipline can keep those superficial similarities from provoking assumptions that may then affect your judgments and decisions. When we disapprove of this, we complain about stereotypes-and when we sympathrze with it, we speak of sensitivity and empathy. It's much the same with language, too. If someone said, \"lt's raining frogs,\" your mind would swiftly fill with thoughts about the origins of those frogs, about what happens to them when they hit the ground, about what could have caused that peculiar plague, and about whether or not the announcer had gone mad. Yet the stimulus for all of this is just three words. How do our minds conceive such complex scenes from such sparse cues? The additional details must come from memories and reasoning. Most older theories in psychology could not account for how a mind could do such things- because, I think, those theories were based on ideas about \"chunks\" of memory that were either much too small or much too large. Some of those theories tried to explain appearances only in terms of low-level \"cues,\" while other theories tried to deal with entire scenes at once. None of those theories ever got very far. The next few sections describe what seems to be a useful compromise; at least it has led to some better results in some projects concerned with Artificial Intelligence. Our idea is that each perceptual experience activates some structures that we'll call framss-shuctures we've acquired in the course of previous experience. We all remember millions of frames, each representing some stereotyped situation like meeting a certain kind of person, being in a certain kind of room, or attending a certain kind of party. 244 F R A M E S\n24.2 FRAMES OF I\\fiIND A frame is a sort of skeleton, somewhat like an application form with many blanks or slots to be fiiled. We'll call these blanks its terminals;we use them as connection points to which we can attach other kinds of information. For example, a frame that represents a \"chair\" might have some terminals to represent a seat, a back, rnd l\"gt, while a frame to represent a \"person\" would have some terminals for a body and head and arms and legs. To represent a particular chair or person, we simply fill in the terminals of the corresponding frame with structures that represeni, ir, ,nore detail, particular features of the back, seat, and legs of that particular person oichair. As we'll see, virtually any kind of agent can be attached to a frame-terminal. It can be a K-line, polyneme, isonome, memory-control script, or, best of all, another frame. In printipie, we could use frames without attaching their terminals to anything. Normally, thoujh, the terminals come with other agents already attached-and these are what we called \"default assignments\" when we first talked about level-bands. If one of your person-frames is active, and you actually see some arms and legs, their descriptions will be assigned to the proper terminals. However, if certain parts cannot be seen, perhaps because they're out of view, the missing information will be filled in by default. We use default assumptions all the time: that's how, when you see someone wearing shoes, you \"know\" that there are feet in them. From where do those assumptions come? I'll argue that Default assumptions fill our frames to represent what's typical. As soon as you hear a word like \"person,\" \"frog,\" or \"chair,\" yot assume the details of some \"typical\" sort of person, frog, or chair. You do this not only with language, but with vision, too. For example, when someone is seated across the table from you, you may be unable to see any part of that person's chair. Still, this situation will probably activate a sitting-frame. But a sitting- ft\"*r will surely have a terminal for what to sit upon, and that will be assigned, by default, to some stereotypical chair. Then, though there is no chair in sight, a chair-frame will be supplied by default. Default assignments are of huge significance because they help us represent our previous experience. We use them for reasoning, recognizing, generalizing, predicting what may happen next, and knowing what we ought to try when expectations aren't met. Our frames affect our every thought and everything we do. Frames are drawn from past experience and rarely fit new situations perfectly. We therefore have to learn how to adapt our frames to each particular experience. Whatif a given situation closely matches several different frames at once? Some such conflicts could be resolved by the \"locking-in\" negotiations we described earlier; then only the frames that manage to suppress their competitors can influence one's other agencies. But the other frames could lurk offstage, awaiting opportunities to intervene. F R A M E S\n24.3 HOTV TRANS.FRAMES WORK In order to be more concrete, let's make a little theory of how a frame might actually work. Consider, for example , a Trans-frame that is filled in to represent this sentence: lack drove from Boston to New York on the turnpike with Mary. Whenever this particular frame is active, if you wonder about the Desf ination of that trip, you'll almost instantly think of New York. This suggests that the polyneme for New York must be aroused by the coincidence of two mental events, namely, ih\" rrousal of this particular travel-frame and the arousal of the pronome for Destination. Now how could a brain-agent recognize such a coincidence? Simple: we need only assume that the polyneme for New York is attached to an AND-agent with two inputs; one of them represents the arousal of the travel- frame itself, and the other represents the arousal of the Destination pronome. Accordingly, each terminal of our frame could simply be an AND-agent with two inputs. sfcNAL FRoM - (- stcNAL FRoM PRONOME I I V FRAME.AGENT I TERMINAL According to this simple scheme, a frame could consist of little more than a collection of AND-agents, one for each of the frame's pronome terminalsl Then the entire frame for the New York trip would look like this: FRAME.AGENT When a frame-agent is activated-either by seeing, hearing, or imagining something-this supplies each of those AND-agents with one of these two inputs. The second input is provided by some pronome which can thereby activate whichever agent or frame is presently assigned to that terminal. If several pronomes are active at the same time, all the corresponding agents will be activated, too. When the frame above is active, the pronome for Origin will activate the K- line for Boston, and the pronome for Yehicle will activate the K-line for car. How could such a frame be made to learn which polynemes should fill its terminals? We could begin with each terminal initially connected to a virgin K-line; then each terminal will represent whatever the corresponding K-line learns. Notice that to build frames this way, w€ need only connect AND-agents to K-lines that can in turn be constructed from little more than simple AND-type agents. One of the great surprises of modern computer science was the discovery that so much can be done with so few kinds of ingredients. PRONOMES TEHMINALS 246 F R A M E S\n24.4 DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS Onty by art cdn we get outside ourselves; instead of seeing only one world, our own, we see it under multiple forms, ond as mdny ds there are original artists, iust so mdnv worlds have we of our disPosal. - M A R C E I P n o u s r When someone says, \"fohn threw a ball,\" lrou probably unconsciously assume a certain set of features and qualities of the ball, like color, srze, and weight. These are your assumptions by default, the kind we talked about when we first introduced the idea of level-bands. Your assumptions about that ball might be derived from some ball you owned long ago--.or, possibly, your newest one. It is our theory that such optional details are usually attached too weakly to hold against the sharp insistence of reality, so that other stimuli will find them easy to detach or otherwise adapt. This is why default assumptions make weak images, and why we aren't too amazedwhen they turn out wrong. It is no surprise that frames share so many properties of K- lines, since the terminals of frames themselves will lie in level-bands near the K-lines whose fringes represent our expectations and default assumptions. But why use default assumptions at all, instead of simply seeing what's really there? Because unless we make assumptions, the world would simply make no sense. It would be as useless to perceive how things \"actually look\" as it would be to watch the random dots on untuned television screens. What really matters is being able to see what things look like. This is why our brains need special machinery for representing what we see in terms of distinct \"obiects.\" The very idea of an object embodies making many assumptions that \"go without saying\"-fe1 example, that it has substance and boundaries, that it existed before we saw it, and that it will remain afterward-in short, that it will act like other typical objects. Thus, though we never see every side of an object at once, we always assume that its unseen sides exist. I suspect that the larger part of what we know-or think we know-is represented bv default assumptions, because there is so little that we know with perfect certaintr'. We use default assumptions in personal relations, too. Why do so many people give such credence to astrology, to classify friends by the months of their births? Perhaps it seems a forward step, to class all persons into just twelve types-to those who once supposed that there were less. And how does the writer's craft evoke such lifelike characters? It's ridiculous to think that people could be well portrayed in so few words. Instead, our story writers use phrases that activate great networks of assumptions that already lie in the minds of their readers. It takes great skill to create those illusions-to activate unknown processes in unknown readers'minds and to shape them to one's purposes. Indeed, in doing so, a writer can make things clearer than reality. For although words are merely catalysts for starting mental processes, soz too, are real things: we can't sense what they really are, only what thev remind us of. As Proust went on to say: Each reader reads only what is already inside himself. A book is only a sort of optical instrument which the writer offers to let the reader discover in himself what he would not have found without the aid of the book. F R A M E S 247\n24.5 NOTWERBAT REASONING Even when you were very young, if someone had told you that most Snarks are green-and, also, that every Boojum is a Snark-you would have been able to conclude that most Boojums are green. What could have led you to that conclusion? Presumably, you answer questions about the properties of Boojums by attaching your polyneme for Snark to whichever of your memory-units currently represents a Boojum. Accordingly, you assume that the color property of a Booium is green by using your usual way of recalling the properties of things you know- activating their polynemes to set your various agencies into the corresponding states. In other words, we do this kind of reasoning by manipulating our memories to replace particular things by typical things. I mention all this because it is often assumed that adults are better than children are at what is often called abstract or logical reasoning. This idea is unfair both to adult and child because logical thinking is so much simpler-and less effective-than common- sense thinking. Actually, what appears to be a matter of \"logic\" is usuallv not logical at all and frequently turns out to be wrong. In the case above, you would have been wrong because Booiums are albino Snarks. The situation is different when you happen to know more about a particular example. For example, suppose you first had learned that penguins cannot fly and then learned that penguins are a kind of bird. When you discover that, should you replace all of your penguin properties with those of your \"generic\" bird? Clearly not, since then you'd lose your hard-earned penguin facts. To deal with this effectively, children must develop complex skills, not merely to replace one representation with another, but to compare two representations and then move around inside them, making different changes at different levels. These intricate skills involve the use of isonomes that control the level-band of the activities inside our agencies. In any case, to reason well, our memory-control agencies must learn to \"move\" our memories around as though those memories were building-blocks. Conceivably, those agencies have to learn such skills before we can learn to build with blocks in the outside world of object-things. Unfortunately, we know very little about how such processes work. Indeed, we're virtually unaware that they even exist, because these kinds of \"commonsense\" inferences and assump- tions come to mind without the slightest conscious effort or activity. Perhaps this unawareness is a consequence of the speed with which those skills employ the very same short-term memory- units that might otherwise be used to record those agents'own recent activities. 248 F R A M E S\n24.6 DIRECTION.NEMES When you think about an obiect in a certain place, many different processes go on inside your mind. Some of your agencies know the visual direction in which that object lies, others tan direct your hand to reach toward it, and yet other agencies anticipate how it would feel if it touched your skin. It is one thing to know that a block has flat sides and right angles, another to be able to recognize a block by sight, and yet another to be able to shape your hand to grasp that shape or recognize it from feeling it in your grasp. How do so many different agencies communicate about places and shapes? No one yet knows how shapes and places are represented in the brain. The agencies that do such things have been evolving since animals first began to move. Some of those agencies must be involved with postures of the arm and hand, others must represent what we discover from the images inside our eyes, and yet others must represent the relations between our bodies and the obiects that surround us. How can we use so many different kinds of information at once? In the following sections I'll propose a new hypothesis to deal with this: that many agencies inside our brains use frames whose terminals are controlled by interaction-squore drrdys. Only now we'll use those square- arrays not to represent the interactions of different causes, but to describe the relations between closely related locations. For example, thinking of the appearance of a certain place or obiect would involve arousing a squarelike family of frames, each of which in turn represents a detailed view of the corresponding portion of that scene. If we actually use such processes, this could explain some psychological phenomena. lf you were walking through a circular tube, you could scarcely keep from thinking in terms of bottom and top and sides-however vdguely their boundaries are de- fined. Without d wdy to represent the scene in terms of familiar parts, you'd have no well-established thinking skills to apply to it. The diagram is meant to suggest that we represent directions and places by attaching them to a special set of pronomelike agents that we shall call \"direction-nemes.\" Later we'll see how these might be involved in surprisingly many realms of thought. UP LEFT6, UP UP RIGHT LEFT fu\"* )ENTERI...i:.i ry-, RIGHT DOWN LEFT DOWN F R A M E S 249\n24.7 PICTT'RE.FRAMES Whenever we see a thing so utterly new that it resembles nothing we've ever seen before, this means that none of our prelearned frames will fit it very well. But this rarely happens to adults. For example, we have each accumulated enough room-frames to represent most rooms we're likelv to see, such as kitchens, bedrooms, offices, factories, and concert halls; one of these will usually match whichever place we happen to be. Besides, we can almost always use a less specific frame that fits most any room at all-a frame with terminals that correspond to nothing more than ceiling, floor, and walls. Then each of those six surfaces could be represented, in turn, by a subframe that has terminals for several vaguely defined regions. To be specific, let's employ our direction-neme idea and divide each surface-for ceiling, floor, and each of the walls-into zones that correspond to the nine regions of an interaction-square. A typical wall might then be represented in this fashion: ffiw l l . - - - - l t I ,t-=-..-JW.lh Effi? In spite of its simplicity, w€ can represent quite a lot of information with this scheme. It provides enough structure to recall later that\"there wds a window toward the left, some shelves high to the right side of the wall, and a table to the right.\" If this does not seem precise enough, the fact is that we usually don't remember things so exactly, except when they attract special attention; normally it would be enough to know only roughly where that television was, and we could assume by default that it was supported by the tabletop. It takes surprisingly few such observations to enable us to tell, later, whether much has been changed. Given more time, one could keep noticing more details and include them by attaching additional subframes. This would overcome the limitations of starting with so few terminals. For example, one might notice that the window is closer to the shelf than to the television set, and closer to the ceiling line than to either the shelf or the television set. And if the outline of the desk and television set reminds you of a goatlike animal, your representation can include that fact. Suppose you had first assumed this to be a living room but later recognized the table to be a kitchen table? Must you undo all the work you've done, to activate a different kitchen-frame and start all over again? No, because later we'll see a convenient way to switch over to another frame-while still retaining what was learned so far. The trick will be to make all our frames for different rooms share the same terminals, so that when we interchange those frames, the information stored in them remains. NW N NE W + E SW S SE 250 F R A M E S\n24.8 HOW PICTI'RE.FRAMES WORK Now that we've seen how \"picture-frames\" could represent memories of spatial arrange- ments, let's ask how we actually build such frames. We'll use the same technique that we used to build Trans,frames, except for one small change. To make a picture-frame, we'll simply replace the pronomes of our Trans-frame scheme by a set of nine direction-nemes! The diagram below also includes an agent to serve for turning on the frame itself. COMPASS SOUARE D I R E C T I O N . N E M E S To apply the picture-frame idea to how our vision-systems work, imagine that you're looking at some real-world scene. Your eyes move in various directions, controlled in some way by direction-nemes. Now suppose that every time you move your eyes, the same direction-nemes also activate the Klines attached to the corresponding terminals of a certain vision-frame. Suppose, also, that those K-lines are ready to form new memories. Then each time you look in a different direction, your vision-system will describe what you see-and the corresponding K- Iine wiII record what you see when you look in that direction! Now suppose that the same frame is activated at some later date-but this time by means of memory and not from looking at some scene. Then, as any of your agencies conceives of looking in a certain direction, the thought itself will involve the activation of the corresponding direction-neme; then, before you have a chance to think of anything else, the corresponding KJine will be aroused. This creates a most remarkable effect: Whichever wdy your \"mind's eye\" Iooks, you'll seem to see the corresponding aspect of the scene. You wiII experience an olmost perfect \"simulus\" of being there! How \"real\" could such a recollection seem? In principle, it could even seem as real as vision itself-since it could make you seem to sense not only how an object looks, but also how it tastes and feels. Shortly we'll see how this could yield not merely the sense of seeing a scene, but also the sense of being able to move around inside it. FRAME.AGENT (nEcocNrzER) FRAME.TERMINALS T R A M E S\n24.9 RECOGNIZERS AND MEMORIZERS How do frames become activated? This amounts to asking how we recog nize familiar situa- tions or things. There is no limit to how complicated such a question can 6\"co-e, since there are no natural boundary lines between recognizing, rememblring, and all the rest of how we think. For questions like this, with no place to start, we have to construct some boundary lines from our own imagination. We'll simply assume that every frame is activated by some set of recognizers. We can regard a recognizer as a type of agent that, in a sense, is the opposite of a K-line-since instead of arousing a certain state of mind, it has to recognize when a certain state of mind occurs. Accordingly, the recognizers of a frame are very much like the terminals of a frame, except that the connections to the terminals are reversed. pronomes termlnals frame-agent RECOGNIZERS MEMORIZERS RECOGNIZERS This suggests that not only frames but agencies in general might be organized in the form of agents sandwiched between recognizers and memorizers. This sketch of how our agencies are organized is oversimplified. Each agent, be it a frame, a K-line, or whatever, must have some machinery for learning when it should become active- and that may require more than simply recognizing the presence of certain features. For example, to recognize an object as a car, it isn't enough that it include some assortment of parts like body, wheels, and license plate; the frame must also recognize that those parts are in suitable relationships-that the wheels be properly attached to the body, for example. Workers in the field of Artificial Intelligence have experimented with a variety of ways to make frame- recognizers, but the field is still in its infancy. The recognizers of our higherJevel agencies might have to include mechanisms as complex as difference-engines in order to match their relational descriptions to actual situations. MEilORIZERS - RECOGNIZERS 252 F R A M E S\nar CHAPTER zo FRAME,ARRAYS The device of images has several defects that are the price of its peculiar excellences. Two of these are perhaps the most important: the image, and particularly the visual image, is apt to go farther in the direction of the individualization of situations than is biologically useful; and the principles of the combination of images have their own peculiarities and result in constructions which are relatively wild, jerky and irregular, compared with the straightfonnard unwinding of a habit, or with the somewhat orderly march of thought. - F . C . B A R T L E T T\n25.1 ONE FRAME AT A TIME? Each of the drawings below can be seen in at least two different ways. The drawing on the left might represent either a single candlestick or two people facing each other. The drawing on the right looks like a cube-but first it looks like a cube as seen from above and then, suddenly, it looks like a cube as seen from below. Why does each drawing seem to change its character from time to time? Why can't we see both forms at once? Because, it seems, our agencies can tolerate just one interpretation at a time. We must ask certain questions here. First, what enables us to see those pictures as composed of the features we call by names like edges, lines, corners, and areas? Our vision-systems seem virtually compelled to group the outputs of our sensors into entities like these. Next, what enables us to see those features as grouped together to form larger obiects? Apparently, our vision- systems again are virtually compelled to represent each of those features, be it a corner, edge, or area, as belonging to one and only one larger object at a time. I won't discuss those questions in this book except to suggest a general hypothesis: Our vision-systems cfie born equipped, on each of several different levels, with some sort of \"Iocking-in\" machinery that at every moment permits each \"pdrt,\" at each level, to be assigned to one and only one \"whole\" 4t the next level. We should also ask, how. do we recognize those obiects as examples of familiar things like faces, cubes, or candlesficJcs? And again we'll make the similar hypothesis that our memory- frame machinery also uses \"locking-in\" machinery that permits each \"object\" to be attached only to one frame at a time. The end result is that in every region of the picture, the frames must compete with one another to account for each feature. 254 F R A M E - A R R A Y S\n25.2 FRAME.ARRAYS When we first discussed how Builderworks, we assumed that it employed a vision-agent, See, to locate the various blocks it needs. However, we never discussed how See itself might work. A person simply \"looks and sees\"-fsft that's more complicated than it seems. For instance, even -a simple \"\"UL looks different from each point of view, since as you move, the images it makes inside your eye keep changing in both shape and size. How strange and dangerous moving would be if every step made everything seem wholly new! But thatrs not how it seems to us. When we move to the right, so that A becomes invisible, we remember what we learned when we saw it, and it still seems part of what we're seeing now. How can this be? Here is a theory of why things seem to stay the same, even when what we see of them keeps changing as we move around. Frame-Arrays. When we moye, our vision-systems switch dmong a family of differ- ent frames that all use the same terminals. I'll use the term \"frame-arrays\" for these groups of frames that share the same terminals. When you represent a thing's details with a frame-array, you can continue to move around yet \"keep in mind\" all that you've observed from those different viewpoints, even though vou've never seen them all at once. This gives us the wonderful ability to conceive of all of an object's different views as aspects of a single thing. I do not mean to suggest that every time you see a new object you build a brand-new frame- array for it. First, you try to match what you see to the frame-arrays in the memories you have accumulated and refined over periods of many years. How do frame-arrays originate? I would assume that this underlying pattern-of families of frames that all share common terminals- is built into the architectures of major sections of the brain. But although that pattern is \"built in,\" developing the skills for using it involves each child in more than a decade of predestined learning. vtEw F R O M L E F T F R A M E . A R R A Y S 255\n25.3 THE STATIONARY WORLD What makes obiects seem to stay in place no matter how the viewer moves? To common sense this is no mystery: it's simply that we're seeing all the time and keeping contact with the world. However, I suspect that if we had to start seeing all over again from every moment to the next, we'd scarcely be able to see at all. This is because our higher-level agents don't \"see\" the outputs of the sensors in our eyes at all. lnstead, they \"wotch\" the states of middle-Ievel agencies that don't change state so frequently. What keeps those \"inner models\" of the world from changing all the time? This is the function of our frame-arrays: to store what we learn about the world at terminals that stay unchanged when we move our heads and bodies around. This explains a wonderful pseudoparadox: objects in the world seem to change only when the pictures they project into our eyes don't change-that is, don't change according to our expec- tations. For example, when you walk past a circular dish, your frame-arrays expect that circle to turn into an ellipse. When that actually happens, the shape continues to \"look\" circular. However, should that expected change fail to occur, the shape will seem to change of its own accord. How, then, do we automatically compensate for changes of view? The system could work just as we described in section 24.8: by using the same direction-nemes both to control our own motions and to select frames from our frame-arrdys. For example, you might use several frames to represent an image of a cube, arranged in a network like this: s#it ,!l:::;:J' When you activate your \"move east\" direction-neme in order to make your body move in that direction, the same signal will also make this frame-array replace the middle frame with the one to its left. This wilicompensate for your change of viewpoint and determine what you \"expect\" to see-and the scene will appear to remain stationaryl Michael Crichton has sug- gesied that when you move inside such a space, you must unconsciously be registering the Iistortions of the shape, the moving walls and corners. Only you don't interpret these as changes in the room itself, but use them as more accurate cues to orient yourself in the sPace. yoir can bypass this entire system by gently pushing the side of your eye with your finger; then the woild will indeed appear to move, because your frame-arrays do not receive the corresponding direction signals ! \"8\"\"' jiiiii: '::1:1:1 ,s.E.... .;l:::t {:l::lL.

A R R A Y S\n25.4 THE SENSE OF CONTINTIITY And any obiect being removed from our eyes, though the impression it made in us remains; yet other obiects more present succeeding, and working on us, the lmagination of the past is obscured. and made weok; os the voyce of a man is in the noyse of the day. From whence it followeth, that the longer the time is, after the sight, or Sense of any obiect, the weaker is the Imagination. For the continuall change of mans body, destroys the parts which in sense were moved; So that distance of time, and of place, hath one and the same effect in us. - H o B B E S Imagine what these frame-arrays can dol They let us \"visualize\" imaginary scenes, such as what might happen when we move, because the frames for what we can expect to see are filled in automatically. Not only that, but by using other processes to fill in all those terminals, we can \"imagine\" scenes and views of things we've never seen before. Still, many people find it hard to consider the thought that mental images could be based on anything as crude as frame- arrays. The world of our experience seems so perfectly continuous. Could such smooth thoughts emerge from sudden frame-to-frame jumps? If the mind kept f erking from one frame to another, wouldn't what we experience seem equally abrupt? Yet we rarely feel our minds change frames, any more than we perceive a visual scene as composed of disconnected spots of light. Why dowe have the sense that things proceed in smooth, continuous ways? Is it because, as some mystics think, our minds are part of some flowing stream? I think it's just the opposite: our sense of constant, steady change emerges from the parts of mind that manage to insulate themselves against the continuous flow of time! In other words, our sense of smooth progression from one mental state to another emerges not from the nature of that progression itself, but from the descriptions we use to represent it. Nothing can seem jerky except what ts represented as jerky. Paradoxically, our sense of conti- nuity comes from our marvelous insensitivity to most kinds of changes rather than from any genuine perceptiveness. Existence seems continuous to us not because we continually experi- ence what is happening in the present, but because we hold to our memories of how things were in the recent past. Without those short-term memories, all would seem entirely new at every instant, and we would have no sense at all of continuity or, for that matter, of existence. One nright suppose that it would be wonderful to possess a faculty of \"continual awareness.\" But such an affliction would be worse than useless, because the more frequently our higher- level agencies change their representations of reality, the harder it is for them to find signifi- cance in what they sense. The power of consciousness comes not from ceaseless change of state, but from having enough stabilitv to discern significant changes in our surroundings. To \"notice\" change requires the ability to resist it. In order to sense what persists through time, one must be able to examine and compare descriptions from the recent past. We notice change in spite of change, not because of it. Our sense of constant contact with the world is not a genuine experience; instead, it is a form of immanence illusion. We have the sense of actuality when every question asked of our visual- systems is answered so swiftlv that it seems os though those dnswers were already there. And that's what frame-arrays provide us with: once any frame fills its terminols, the terminals of the other frames in its drrdy are also filled. When every change of view engdges frames whose termi- nals are already filled, albeit only by default, then sight seems instantaneous. F R A M E - A R R A Y S 257\n25.5 EXPECTATIONS But in the common wdy of taking the view of any opake obiect, that port of its surface, which fronts the eye, is apt to occupy the mind alone, and the opposite, ndy even every other part of it whatever, is left unthought of at that time: and the least motion we make to reconnoitre any other side of the obiect, confounds our first idea, for want of the connexion of the two ideas. - W I L L I A U H o G A R T H Imagine that you turned around and suddenly faced an absolutely unexpected scene. You'd be as shocked as though the world had changed before your eyes because so many of your expectations were not met. When we look about a familiar place, we know roughly what to expect. But what does expect mean? Whenever we become familiar with some particular environment like an office, home, or outdoor place, we represent it with a frame- afia\\l whose terminals have already been filled. Then, for each direction of motion inside that environment, our vision-systems activate the corresponding frames of that array. We also activate the corresponding frames even when we merely consider or imagine a certain body motion-and this amounts to \"knowing what to expect.\" In general, each frame of a spatial frame-array is controlled by some direction-neme. However, in surroundings that are either especially familiar or whose relationships we do not understand, we may learn to use more specific stimuli instead of using direction-nemes to switch the frames. For example, when you approach a familiar door, the frame for the room that you expect to find behind that door might be activated, not by your direction of motion, but by your recognition of that particular door. This could explain how a person can reside in the same home for decades, yet never learn which of its rooms share common walls. In any case, all this is oversimplified. Many of our frame-arrays must require more than nine direction views; they need machinery to modify the sizes and shapes of their objects; they rnust be adapted to three dimensions; and they must be able to represent what happens at interme- diate moments during motion from one view to another. Furthermore, the control of frame selection cannot depend on a single, simple set of direction-nemes, for we must also compen- sate for the motions of our eyes, neck, body, and legs. Indeed, a major portion of our brain- machinery is involved with such calculations and corrections, and it takes a long time to learn to use all that machinery. The psychologist Piaget found that it takes ten years or more for children to refine their abilities to imagine how the same scene will appear from different viewpoints. this was the basis of Hogarth's complaint. The artist felt that many painters and sculptors neyerlearned enough abouf spatial transformations. He felt that mental imagery is an acquired skill, and he scolded artists who gave too little time to \"perfecting the ideas they have in their minds about the objects in nature.\" Accordinglv, Hogarth worked out ways to train people to better predict how viewpoints change appearances. fHe who undertakes the acquisition ofl perfect ideas of the distonces, bearings, and oppositions of several material points and lines in even the most irregular figure's,' will gradually arriye at the knack of recalling them into his mind when the 'obiects themsetves dre not before him-and will be of infinite service to those who inyent and draw from fancy, as well as to enable those to be more correct who draw from the life. 258 F R A M E - A R R A Y S\n25.6 THE FRAME IDEA Questions arise from a point of view-from something that helps to structure what is problematical, what is worth asking, and what constitutes dn dnswer (or progress). It is not that the view determines reality, only what we accept from reality and how we structure it. I am realist enough to believe that in the long run reality gets its own chance to accept or reiect our yarious yiews. - A l l n N N E w E L L I first conceived the idea of frames in the early 1970s, while working on making a robot that could see, and I described the theory in a I974 essay entitled \"A Framework for Representing Knowledge. \" The essay influenced the next decade of research on Artificial Intelligence, despite the fact that most readers complained that its explanations were too vague. In retrospect, it seems those explanations were at just the right level-bands of detail to meet the needs of that time, which is why the essay had the effect it did. If the theory had been any vaguer, it would have been ignored, but if it had been described in more detail, other scientists might have \"tested\" it, instead of contributing their own ideas. Then they might have found my proposals were inadequate. Instead, many versions were suggested by other people, and \"frame-based\" programming became popular. Two students in particular, Scott Fahlman and Ira Goldstein, claimed to understand what I had meant-and then explained many details I hadn't imagined at all. Another student, Terry Winograd, worked on making a robot that understood a certain class of English-language sentences; this led to important theories about the relation between grammar and its effect upon a listener. Then, since that robot's task was building towers of children's blocks, Winograd also worked out many details of how to make a Builder. You can see how his theories affected this book. Yet another student, Eugene Charniak, worked on the problem of how young children understand the stories they read. He spent at least a solid year thinking about one such story, which had to do with bringing a kite to a birthday party. Shortly, you'll see the influence Charniak had on this book. All along, I had felt that the frame idea itself was rather obvious and perhaps implicit in the earlier work of psychologists like Bartlett. I considered the more important concept in the I974 essay to be the idea of a frame-system-renamed \"frame-arrav\" in this book. I was surprised that the frame idea became popular while the frame-array idea did not. The neme concept emerged in 1977 (under the term \"C-lines\"); the K-line idea crystallized in 1979. The concept of pronomes was in my unconscious mind for several years but did not crystallize until, while writing this book, I realized how to reformulate several of Roger Schank's early ideas into the form of Trans-frames. The scheme proposed in this book, in which the frame-terminals are controlled by bundles of nemes or isonomes, did not emerge until a full decade after the original concept of a frame-array. Many questions remain about how frames might work. F or example, it should be possible to recognize several different things at once by using different frames in parallel. But how can we see many faces in a crowd at once, or bricks in a wall, or chairs in a room? Do we make many copies of the same frame? I suspect that's impractical. Instead, perhaps we match each frame only to one example at a time-and simply assume that the same frame also applies to every other visible object that shares some characteristic features with the object under attention.

FRAMES Thinking . . . is possible only when d wdy hos been found of breaking up the \"mdssed\" influence of past stimuli and situations, only when a device has already been discovered for conquering the sequential tyranny of past reactions. But though it is a later and a higher development, it does not supersede the method of images. It has its own drawbacks. Conf rasted with imaging it loses something of vivacity, of vividness, of variety. Its prevailing instruments are words, and, not only because these are sociol, but also because in use they dre necessorily strung out in sequence, they drop into habit reactions even more readily than images do.

If you asked what that kite was for, most people would answer that it must be a birthday present for fack. How amazing it is that every normal person can make such complicated inferences so rapidly-considering that the idea of a gift was never mentioned at all! Could any machine do such remarkable things? Consider all the other assumptions and conclusions that almost everyone will make: The \"party\" is a birthday party. lack and Mary are children. \"She\" is Mary. \"He\" is lack. She is considering giving Iack a kite. She wonders if he would like the kite. We call these understandings \"common sense.\" They're made so swiftly that they're often ready in our minds before a sentence is completel But how is this done? In order to realize that the kite is a present, one has to use such knowledge as that parties involve presents, that presents for children are usually toys, and that kites are appropriate toys to be given as presents. None of this is mentioned in the story itself. How do we bring together all that scattered knowledge so quickly? Here's what I think must happen. Somehow the words\"Mary was invited to lack's party\" arouses a \"party-invitation\" frame in the reader's mind-and attached to the terminals of that frame are certain memories of various concerns. Who is the host? Who will attend? What present should I bring? What clothing shall I wear? Each of those concerns, in turn, is represented by a frame to whose terminals are already attached, as default assignments, the most usual solutions to that particular kind of problem. Such knowledge comes from previous experience. I was raised in a culture in which an invitation to a party carries the obligation to arrive well dressed and to bring a birthday present. Accordingly, when I read or hear that Mary was invited to a party, I attribute to Mary the same sorts of subjective reactions and concerns that I would have in such a situation. Therefore, although the story never mentions clothes or gifts at all, to expect their possible involvement seems only simple common sense. But though it is common, it is not simple. The next few sections speculate about how story understanding works. 26t T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.2 UNDERSTANDING STORIES We'll now see how frames can help to explain how we understand that children's tale. How do we know that the kite is a present for lack-when neither sentence mentioned this? Mary was invited to lack's party. She wondered if he would like a kite. After the first sentence activates a party-invitation frame, the reader's mind remains engaged with that frame's concerns-including the question of what type of birthday gift to bring. If this concern is represented by some subframe, what are the concerns of that subframe? That present must be something that will please the party host. \"Toy\" would be a good default for it, since that's the most usual kind of gift for a child. Terminals: Host Gif t Constraint: Host likes gift The first sentence suggests using Iack to fill in the fHostJ terminal. Host G if t Jack likes toy The second sentence suggests using kite for toy and He for fHost]. Host He Gif t likes kite Mary was invited to fack's party. She wondered if he would like a kite. Since \"Jack\" is a \"he\" and a \"kite\" is a \"toy,\" these two frames will merge perfectly-provided that the reader's frame for boy assumes that fack is likely to enjoy kites. Then our two sentences combine perfectly to fill the present frame's terminals, and our problem is solved! Terminals: Host G if t Constraint: Jack likes kite What makes a story comprehensible? What gives it coherency? The secret lies in how each phrase and sentence stirs frames into activity or helps already active ones to fill their terminals. When the first sentence of our story mentions a party, various frames are excited-and these are still active in the reader's mind when the next sentence is read. The ground is prepared for understanding the second sentence because so many agents are already ready to recognize possible references to presents, clothes, and other matters that might be related to birthday parties. 262 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.3 SENTENCE.FRAMES People do not usually state all the ports of a given thought that they are trying to communicate because the speaker tries to be brief and leaves out assumed or unessential information. The conceptual processor searches for a given type of information in a sentence or a larger unit of discourse that will fill the needed slot. - R o c e n S c H A N K We've barely started to see what minds must do to comprehend the simplest children's tales. Let's look again at the beginning of our party story. Mary was invited to lack's party. How marvelous that sentence is! How much it says in just six words! Two characters are introduced and quickly cast in clear-cut roles. We learn that there will be a party soon, with Iack as the host and Mary a guest-provided she accepts the invitation. We also learn that this setting is established in the past. Those six short words tell even more. We can expect the story to focus on Mary's activities rather than fack's-because \"Mary\" is the first word that attracts our attention. But to accom- plish that, the narrator had to use a clever grammar-tactic. Normally, 3n English-language sentence begins with a phrase that describes the Actor responsible for some action, and we usually represent this with a simple Trans-frame. IACK INYIT-ed MARY Donor action verb Recipient In this \"active verb\" form of sentence-frame, the verb is sandwiched between two nouns; the first describes a Donor and the second describes a Recipienf . However, if our storyteller actually used the active form of sentence-frame, it would tend to mislead the listener into expecting Iack to be the central character of the story-if only because he is mentioned first. Fortunately, English grammar provides an alternative sentence-frame in which the Reci pient is mentioned first-and which never mentions the Donor at all! MARY wds INYIT-ed Recipientwas verb-ed. How does the understanding listener detect this \"passive verb\" sentence-frame? Some language-agent has to notice the way the verb is sandwiched between \"wds\" and\"-ed.\" As soon as this special subframe is recognized, the language-agency will reassign the first noun, Mary, not to the Donor terminal, but to the Recipienf terminal-and thus Mary is represented as receiving the invitation. Why don't we need to say who the donor is? Because in this case the listener can assume it by default. Specifically, the expression \"lack's party\" evokes a \"party- invitation frame,\" and in such situations it is typical for the host-or the host's parents-to invite the party guests. By thus arousing familiar frames, we can say a great deal in a very few words. I A N G U A G E F R A M E S 263\n26.4 A PARTT-FRAME par.ty n. A gathering for social entertainment, or the entertainment itself, often of a specific nature. -W ebster' s U nabridged Dictionary Dictionary definitions never say enough. Every child knows that a party is more than just a gathering assembled to celebrate someone's birthday. But no brief definition can describe the complicated customs, rules, and regulations that typical communities prescribe for such cere- monies. When I was a child, a birthday party could be expected to include at least the elements of the following script: ARRIVAL. Greeting. Be well dressed. GIF'T. Give birthday present to host or guest of honor. GAMES. Activities like blindfold competitions. DECOR. Balloons. Favors. Crepe-paper decorations. PARTY-MEAL. Hotdogs, candies, ice-cream, etc. CAKE. With candles to represent the host's age. CEREMONY. Host tries to extinguish candles with single breath (to make a wish). SONG. All guests sing birthday song and eat cake. This is merely an outline, for every item leads to other conditions and requirements. The birthday present has to please the host, of course, but there are other strong constraints on it as well. It ought to be brand new, of good quality, and it should not be ostentatiously extrava- gant. It ought to be suitably \"party-wrapped\"-that is, covered with a certain kind of color- printed wrapping paper and tied with colored ribbon. There are also constraints on other items in the script. The birthday cake should be covered with a sweet sugar frosting. In my childhood, the ice cream usually consisted of three colored stripes of different flavors: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate. Because I did not like the strawberry flavor, my personal party script included the extra steps of finding another child willing to make a trade. To all their young participants, such parties unfold exactly as a party should, with all these queer complexities. We take our social customs for granted, as though they were natural phenomena. Few guests or hosts will ever wonder why their parties have those explicit forms or isk about their origins. As far as any child can tell, that's just how parties ought to go; they always did and always will. And so it is with almost everything we know. 264 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.5 STORY.FRAMES It's the way in which all toles have been told from Homer and Sophocles down through Kipling, Hemingway, Bradbury, Sturgeon, McCaffrey, Zelazny, whoever. Once upon a time, you say, there lived so-and-so in such and such a place, and while he was minding his own business the following absolutely astonishing thing happened to him. And so you begin; and they gather close about you, for they cannot choose but to hear. - R o B E R T S t t , v E R B E R G We take it for granted that anyone can understand a story. But every kind of narrative demands some \"listening skills.\" Even the best storytellers find it hard to entertain children, who are prone to interrupt with questions that make perfect sense by themselves but drift away from the story's theme. \"Where does Mary live?\" \"Does she have a dog?\" To listen well, a child must acquire potent forms of self-control. The storyteller, too, must work to fix the focus of the listener's mind. If you were speaking about something else and suddenly, completely out of context, remarked, \"Mary was invited to lack's party,\" an unprepared listener might wonder, \"Mary who?\" and look to see if you were addressing someone else. But you can first prepare the listener by saying, \"Would you like to hear a story?\" or simply, \"Once upon a time . . .\" What is the function of such a phrase? It has a very specific effect: to set the listener into a normal and familiar state of expecting to hear a certain type of narrative-a story. In the English tradition, stories typically begin by specifying the time-if only vaguely, by saying \"long dgo.\" I'm told that in fapan most stories start with saying where as well-if only by some empty phrase like \"in a certain time and place.\" The biblical book of fob begins with, \"There wds d mdn in the land of Uz . . .\" Most stories start with just enough to set the scene. Then they introduce some characters, with hints about their principal concerns. Next, the storyteller gives some clues about some \"main event\" or problem to be solved. From that point on, the listener has a general idea of what comes next: there will be more development of the problem; then it will be resolved, somehow; and then the story will end, perhaps by giving some practical or moral advice. In any case, those magic story-starting words arouse, in knowing listeners' minds, great hosts of expectation-frames to help the listeners anticipate which terminals to fill. Terminal or Concern Assignment Time Setting? Place Setting? Protagonist? Central Concern? Antagonist? The past Iack's home Mary is heroine Mary' s subiective reaction lndicated by Past tense of verb Destination Syntactic emphasis Default assumption I'lot yet mentioned Beyond arousing all these specific expectations, \"once upon a time\" plays one more crucial role: it says that what comes after it is fictional or, in any case, far too remote to activate much personal concern. Instead, it tells the listener to disregard the normal sympathies one should feel when real persons meet the monstrous destinies so usual in children's tales: to be turned into toads, imprisoned in stones, or devoured by terrible dragon beasts. T A N G U A G E F R A M E S 265\n26.6 SENTENCE AND NONSENSE Part of what a sentence means depends upon its separate words, and part depends on how those words are arranged. Round squdres steal honestly. Honestly steal squdres round. What makes these seem so different in character, when both use the very same words? I'll argue that this is because your language-agency, immediately upon hearing the first word- string, knows exactly what to do with it because it fits a well-established sentence-frame. The second string fits no familiar form at all. But how do we fit those sentence-frames? We'll come to that presently, but for the moment, let's simply assume that our young listener has somehow come to classify words into various types, like nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. (We'll ignore the fact that children go through other stages before they use words as adults do.) Then our first string of words has this form: Adiective Noun Y erb Adverb Now we'll suppose our listener has learned a specific recognition-frame that is activated on hearing this string of particular types of words. This frame then executes a special process script that makes the following assignments to the terminals of aTrans-frame. The neme for \"steal\" is assigned to the Trans-frame's Action terminal, while the neme for \"squares\" is attached to the Actor terminal. The frame then activates scripts that modify the action \"steal\" by applying to it the neme for \"honestly\" and modify the object \"squares\" by applying to it the neme for \"round. \" Up to this point, everything works smoothly: the language-agency has found a use for every word. We have special names for the strings of words that we process with such fluency: we call them \"phrases\" or \"sentences. \" A word-string seems \"grdmmdtical\" if all its words fit quickly and easily into frames that connect suitably to one another. However, at this point some serious conflicts start to appear within some other agencies because of certain incompatibilities. The frame for \"steal\" requires its Actor to be animate. A square can't steal, because it's not alive! Besides, the frame for \"steal\" expects an act that's reprehensible, and that clashes with the modifier for \"honestly.\" If that weren't bad enough, our agency for describing shape can't tolerate the polynemes for \"round\" and \"square\" when both are activated at the same time. It doesn't matter that our sentence is grammatical: so much turmoil is set up that most of its meaning cancels out and we regard it as \"nonsense.\" But it is important to reco gnize that the distinction between sense and nonsense is only partly a matter of grammar, for consider what happens when you hear these three words: thief -- -- careless -- -- prison -- Although these do not establish any single well-formed grammar-frame, they activate some word-sense nemes that skip past all our grammar-forms to fit a familiar story-frame, a moral tale about a thief who's caught and reaps a just reward. Ungrammatical expressions can fre- quently be meaningful when they lead to clear and stable mental states. Grammar is the servant of language, not the master. 266 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.7 FRAMES FOR NOUNS At various points in their development, most children seem suddenly to comprehend new kinds of sentences. Thus, once they learn to deal with single adjectives, some children quickly learn to deal with longer strings like these: Dogs bark. Big dogs bark. Big shaggy dogs bark. Big black shaggy dogs bark. If this were done by using word-string sentence-frames, it would require a separate frame for each different number of adjectives. Another scheme would not use any frames at all but have the language-agency convert each adjective, as it arrives, into some corresponding neme. And yet another scheme to handle this (still popular among some grammar theorists) would have each successive adjective arouse a new subframe inside the previous one. However, when we look more closely at how people use adjectives, we find that these strings are not simple at all. Compare the two phrases below: The wooden three heavy brown big first boxes . . . The first three big brown heavy wooden boxes . . . Our language-agents scarcely know what to do with that first string of words because it doesn't fit the patterns we normally use for describing things. This suggests that we use framelike structures for describing nouns as well as verbs-that is, for describing things as well as actions. To fill the terminals of those frames, we expect their ingredients to arrive in a more or less definite order. We find it hard to understand a group of English adjectives unless they are arranged roughly as shown below. :CIngr:ii'iiolii ::::::All::::::::::::::::::::::'t i::::::::::: ii.1i::N.iiiiiii:4c.iiiiitl lii:i::ii*Jff i:i::i:iii:i SELECTOR the first l three hat boxes. I NOUN ORDERER SIZE SHAPE COLOR DETERMINER NUMBER POLYNEME CLASSIFIER Whenever a language community can agree on forms like these, expression becomes easier. Then every individual can learn, once and for all, where to put-and where to find-the answers to questions most frequently asked. In English one learns to say \"green box,\" while in French one says \"box green.\" It doesn't matter which order is used-as long as everyone agrees to do it the same way. But what are the \"questions most frequentfu asked\"-the ones we build into our language-forms? The answer to this is likely to be somewhat circular, since the lan- guage culture in which we're raised will probably affect the kinds of questions that will seem most natural to ask. Still, there could be useful clues in features that are common to many different languages. Many scientists have asked, indeed, why so many human languages use similar structures such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, clauses, and sentences. It is likely that some of these reflect what is genetically built into our language-agencies. But it seems to me even more likely that most of these nearly universal language-forms scarcely depend on langu age at all-but reflect how descriptions are formed in other agencies. The most common forms of phrases could arise not so much from the architecture of the language-agencies as from the machinery used by other agencies for representing objects, actions, differences, and purposes-as suggested in section 22.7-and from how those other agencies manipulate their memories. In short, the ways we think must have a strong and universal influence on how we speak-if only through its influence on the sorts of things we'll want to say. T A N G U A G E F R A M E S 267\n26.8 FRAMES FOR VERBS We've seen how a four-word sentence such as \"Roun d squares steal honestly\" could be made to fit a certain four-terminal frame. But what about a sentence like \"The thief who took the moon moved it to Paris\"? It would be dreadful if we had to learn a new and special ten-word frame for each particular type of ten-word string! Clearly we don't do any such thing. Instead, we use the pronoun \"who\" to make the listener find and fill a second frame. This suggests a multistage theory. In the earliest stages of learning to speak, we simply fill the terminals of word-string frames with nemes for words. Then, later, we learn to fill those terminals with other fiIled-in language-frames. For example, we can describe our moon sentence as based on a top- level Trans-frame for \"move\" whose Actor terminal contains a second Trans-frame for \"took\": Using frames this way simplifies the iob of learning to speak by reducing the number of different kinds of frames we have to learn. But it makes language learning harder, too, because we have to learn to work with several frames at once. How do we know which terminals to fill with which words? It isn't so hard to deal with \"red, round, thin-peeled fruit,\" since each such property involves a different agency. But that won't work for \"Mary loves lack,\" since \"lack loyes Mdry\" has the very same words, and only their order indicates their different roles. Each child must learn how the order of words affects which terminal each phrase should fill. As it happens, English applies the same policy both to \"Mary loves lack\" and to our moon sentence: Assign the Acfor pronome to the phrase before the verb. Assign the Obiecf pronome to the phrase after the verb. The policies for assigning phrases to pronomes vary from one language to another. The word order for Actor and Obiecf is less constrained in Latin than in English, because in Latin those roles can be specified by altering the nouns themselves. In both languages we often indicate which words should be assigned to other pronome roles by using specific prepositions like \"for \" \"by,\" and \"with.\" In many\"arr\"r, differentverb types usethe same prepositions to indicate the use of different pronomes. At first such usages may seem to be arbitrary, but they frequently encode important systematic metaphors; in section2I.2we saw how \"from\" and \"to\" are used to make analogies between space and time. How did our language-forms evolve? We have no record of their earliest forms, but they surely were affected at everv stage by the kinds of questions and problems that seemed important at the time. The features of present-day lan- guages may still contain some clues about our ancestors'concerns. 268 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.9 I.ANGUAGE AND VISION Some language scholars seem to think that what we do in language is unique, in the filling of frames withgthlr frames to open up a universe of complicated structure-forms. But consider how frequently we do similarly complex things in understanding visual scenes. The language- agency must be able to interrupt itself, while handling one phrase, to work on parts of another p[r\"r., and this involves some complex short-term memory skills. But in vision, too, there must t. si*il\"r processes involved in breaking scenes apart and representing them as composed of objects and relationships. The picture below suggests how similar such processes may be. In language, the problem is to recognize that the two words \"took\" and \"out\" both belong to the r\"*\" virb phrase, although they are separated in time. In vision, the problem is to recognize the two ,\"gio.rr of a tabletop as being parts of the same object, although they are separated in space. Notice also that we cannot see the tops of the blocks that serve as legs-and yet we do not have the slightest doubt about where they end. Similarly, the ends of language phrases are frequently unmarked-yet again we can tell where they end. ln \"The thief who took the moon moved it to Pdris,\" the word \"who\" marks the beginning of a new frame, but there is no special word to indicate the ending of that phrase. Why don't we wrongly assign \"the moon\" to the Actor of the spurious phrase, \"The moon moved it to Paris?\" It is because we first heard who took the moon,\" which caused \"the moon\" to get attached to the Obiecf pronome of theTrans-frame for \"took\"-5e now it's not available to serve as Actor in the frame for \"moved.\" \"The thief is still available to play that role. I don't mean to suggest we can never assign the same phrase to two different roles, only that good speakers choose their forms so that this doesn't happen by accident. Did our capacity to deal with phraselike structures evolve first in language or in vision? Among our ancestors, vision greatly antedates language, so if these abilities are related, our language-agencies themselves more likely evolved from variants of genes that first evolved in shaping the architecture of our vision-systems. Today we have no way to verify such a coniec- ture, but future geneticists may become able to trace the ancestry of many such relationships by examining the genes that generate the corresponding brain structures. L A N G U A G E F R A M E S 269\n26.10 TEARNING I.ANGUAGE Language is itself the collective art of expression, d summary of thousands upon thousands of individual intuitions. The individual goes lost in the collective creation, but his personal expression has left some trace in a certain give and flexibility that are inherent in all collective works of the human spirit. - E o w A R o S n p r n The vocabulary of a language-the words themselves-is the product of a project that spans the history of a culture and can involve millions of person years of work. Every sense of every word records some intellectual discovery that now outlives the myriad other, less distinguished thoughts that never earned a name. Each person invents some new ideas, but most of these will die when their owners do, except for those that make their way into the culture's lexicon. Still, from that ever-growing reservoir we each inherit many thousands of powerful ideas that all our predecessors found. Yet it is no paradox to say that even as we inherit those ideas from our culture, we each must reinvent them for ourselves. We cannot learn meanings only by memorizing definitions: we must also \"understand\" them. Each situation in which a word is used must suggest some mixture of materials already in the mind of a listener, who then, alone, must attempt to assemble these ingredients into something that will work in consonance with other things already learned. Definitions sometimes help-but still one must separate the essences from the accidents of the context, link together structures and functions, and build connections to the other things one knows. A word can only serve to indicate that someone else may have a valuable idea- that is, some useful structure to be built inside the mind. Each new word only plants a seed: to make it grow, a listener's mind must find a way to build inside itself some structure thot appears to work like the one in the mind from which it wds \"Iedrned.\" Along with the words, we also have to learn the grammar-tactics for using them. Most children start by using only one or two words at a time. Then, over the next two or three years, they learn to speak in sentences. It usually takes a full decade to learn most of the conventions of adult speech, but we often see relatively sudden advances over concentrated periods of time. How do children learn such complicated skills so quickly? Some language theorists have sug- gested that children learn to use grammar so readily that our brains must be born with built-in grammar-machinery. However, we've seen that our visual-systems solve many similar problems in even earlier years-and we've also seen that when they learn to play with spoons and pails, children must learn yet other languagelike skills for managing the Origins, Destinations, Recip- ients, and Insf ruments of their actions. Thus, many sections of our brains appear to demon- strate capacities for rearranging pronome roles even before we learn to speak. If so, perhaps we ought not to wonder so much about how children learn to speak so readily. Instead, we ought to wonder why it takes so long, when they already do so many similar things inside their heads. 270 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.II GRAMMAR How do we choose the words we speak, and how do we understand what others say? Earlier, I suggested that in the course of learning language we accumulate various processes and tactics thaiLnable us to partially reproduce our own mental operations in other speakers. These processes affect oui choices of words, the forms we select for phrases and sentences, and the ityl.r in which we frame our narratives. There have been many attempts to study how children learn language, but psychologists do not yet have coherent theories about the underlying processer. For example, we do not yet even know whether we learn each bit of grammar only bn\"\"-or whether we have to learn it twice, for speaking and for understanding what other people say. We know so little about such matters that we can scarcely even speculate about the nature of those early language-learning steps. Perhaps the process starts with some agents that can enable a child to make various vocal sounds in response to specific internal states. These agents then become involved with built-in \"predestined\" learning processes that lead to limited abilities to imitate other sounds the child hears by using feedback from its ears. Later stages might then engage new layers of agents that connect word-sound agents to whichever polynemes are most frequently attached to certain pronomes in the language-agency. Once a suitable variety of such processes are established, more layers of frame- and memory-controlling agents could learn to support more complex language skills. Let's try to imagine what kind of process could produce a language phrase that \"expresses\" a description of an object. Suppose, for example, that you want to draw attention to a certain very big box. To imagine such a thing in the first place, you might first have to activate your polyneme for \"box\" and then arouse some other isonomes and polynemes that modify the state of your Size agency. To express \"very big box\" might thus require grammar-tactics that express three mental operations: ---\"box\" expresses the arousal of the box polyneme; ---\"big\" expresses a process that selects the Size ogency; ---\"very\" expresses an isoname that adiusts the sensitivities of agents in whichever dgency was selected. I do not mean to suggest that a child's earliest three-word noun phrases must be based upon such complicated processes; more likely they begin with simpler sequence scripts. Eventually, though, more complex systems intervene to replace the simple scripts by intricate kinds of frame-arrays that enable the child to make more complex rearrangements of what becomes attached to its expression-frames. Then, as the language-agency acquires more isonome- controlling skills, the child can learn to use pronouns like \"it\" or \"she\" to express other struc- tures that are already attached to suitable pronomes. Also, as we develop skills for building chains and trees from other frames, the language-agency can learn to use corresponding grammar-tactics to express those chains-stringing together phrases and sentences with con- junction words like \"and\" and \"but.\" Similarly, as we improve our methods for controlling memories and managing interruptions, we can learn to combine those skills with clause- interrupting forms like \"who\" and \"which. \" There seems scarcely any limit to the complexity of our social inventions for expressing mental processes, and it takes most children many years to master all the language arts their ancestors evolved. 271 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\n26.12 COHERENT DISCOURSE Words . . cdn indicate the qualitative and relational features of a situation in their general aspect iust as directly as, and perhaps even more satisfactorily than, they can describe its particular individuality. This is, in fact, what gives to language its intimate relation to thought processes. For thinking, in the proper psychological sense, is netter the mere reinstatement of some suitable past situation produced by a crossing of interests, but is the utilization of the past in solution of difficulties set by the present. . . . - F . C . B A R T L E T T Every discourse works on several scales. Each word you hear can change your state in a way that depends upon all the structures you have built while listening to the words that came before. Most of those structures are themselves mere transient things, which persist for only a few moments before you rearrange some of their parts and perhaps discard the rest entirely. Thus, a car might first appear as the subject of a sentence, then become a mere vehicle or instrument in the next sentence; finally, the whole scenario might be used merely to modify a personal trait of some actor in a larger scene. As a discourse proceeds, details on each scale become absorbed into larger-scale representation networks whose outlines become increasingly remote from the individual words that were used to construct them. It would be wonderful to have a compact, self-contained theory that explains all our language-forms. But that ideal cannot be realized because words are merely the external signs of very complex processes, and there is no clear boundary between languoge and all the rest of what we call thinking. To be sure, the boundaries of words themselves are relatively clear, and when they have multiple meanings, our grammar-tactics can often help us to assign the proper senses to various terminals and other structures. These tactics include all sorts of inflections, prepositions, word orderings, and signals that indicate how to include one phrase inside an- other. We also combine words into larger expressions that range in vagueness of boundaries from compact clichds like \"hot dog\" to diffuse signals that are scarcely linked to specific words at all; these include our hard-to-describe nuances of phrasing, rhythm, intonation, and shifts of style and flow. We're normally quite unaware of how our grammar-tactics constrain us in our choices of words. We're often somewhat more aware of other language-tactics we use to guide our lis- teners' minds-to change the focus from one theme to another, to adiust the levels of detail, to shift between foreground and setting. We learn to use phrases like \"by the way\" to change the topic of concern, to say \"for example\" to shift to a finer level of detail, to say \"but\" to modify an expectation or to interrupt the usual flow, or to say \"in any cdse\" or \"in spite of that\" to indicate the end of an interruption or elaboration. But even all this is only a small part of language. To understand what people say, we also exploit our vast stores of common knowledge, not only about how specific words are related to the subjects of concern, but also about how to express and discuss those subjects. Every human community evolves a great array of discourse-forms to shape its stories, explanations, conver- sations, discussions, and styles of argument. fust as we learn grammar-forms for fitting words to sentence-frames, we also build ,tp stocks of \"plots\" to organize our story-tales, and standard personalities to fill the roles of their protagonists-and every child must learn these forms. 272 T A N G U A G E F R A M E S\nCHAPTER 27 CENSORS AND JOKES A man at the dinner table dipped his hands in the mayonnaise and then ron them through his hair. When his neighbor looked astonished, the mdn apologized: \"I'm so sorry ' I thought it was sPinach.\" - S r c M U N n F R E U D\n27.I DEMONS Our reader must be anxious to know what finally became of Mary and that kite. Here is more of that story. Mary was invited to lack's party. She wondered if he would tike a kite. lane said, \"lack already has a kite. He will make you take it back.\" What does the pronoun \"it\" mean here? Clearly fane is speaking not of the kite that already belongs to fack, but of the new kite that Mary is thinking oi giving to hi-. But what leads the listener to assume that this is what the storyteller meant? There are many issues here besides the question of which kite is involved. How do we know \"it\" refers to a kite at all? Does ,.take it back\" mean take it back from Jack or to return it to the store? For the sake of simplicity, let's put aside the other possibilities and assume that \"if\" must mean a kite. But in order to decide which kite is meant, we still must understand the larger phrase \"take it back.\" This phrase must refer to some structure already in the listener's mind; the narrator expects the listener to find the appropriate structure by activating an appropriate fragment of \"o-rnonsense knowledge about giving and receiving birthday presents. But sinc\" .u\"ry listener knows so many things, yh\"! sorts of processes could activate the appropriate knowledge without taking too much time? ln L974 Eugene Charniak, a graduate student at MIT, asked how each phrase of this story works to prepare the reader to comprehend the subsequent phrases. He suggested that when- ever we hear about a particular event, specific recognition-agents are thereby aroused. These then proceed actively to watch and wait for other related types of events. (Because these recognition-agents lurk silently, to intervene only in certain circumstances, they are sometimes called \"demons-\") For example, whenever a story contains the slightest hint that someone may have purchased a gift, specific demons might be aroused that watch for events like these: If there is evidence that the recipient reiects the gift, look for signs of it being returned. lf you see evidence of a gift being returned, look for signs-that the recipi- ent reiected it. Charniak's thesis raised many questions. How easy should it be to activate demons? How long should they then remain active? If too few demons are aroused, we'll be slow to understand what's happening. But if too many become active, we'll get confused by false alarms. There are no simple solutions to these problems, and what we call \"understanding\" is a huge accumula- tion of skills. You might understand certain parts of a story by using separate, isolated demons; you might comprehend other aspects of that same story by using largei-scale processes that try to match the sequence of events to various remembered scripts; yet other understandings mighi depend upon which agents are aroused by various micronemes. How much of the fascinatiort in telling a story, or in listening to one, comes from the manipulations of our demons' expec- tations? 274 C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S\n27.2 SITPPRESSORS It would be wonderful never to make mistakes. One way would be to always have such perfect thoughts that none of them is ever wrong. But such perfection can't be reached. Instead we try, a-s best we can, to recognize our bad ideas before they do much harm. We can thus imagine two poles of self-i-prou.-int. On one side we try to stretch the range of the ideas we generate: this leads to mor\" id\"\"r, but also to more mistakes. On the other side, we try to learn not to repeat mistakes we've made before. All communities evolve some prohibitions and taboos to teil their members what they shouldn't do. That, too, must happen in our minds: we accumu- late memories to tell ourselves what we shouldn't think. But how could we make an agent to prevent us from doing something that, in the past, has led to bad or ineffectual resultsftdeallv, that agent would keep us from even thinking that bad idea again. But that seems almost paradoxical, like telling someone, \"Don't think about a *onkiyt\" yet there is a way to accomplish this. To see how it works, imagine the sequence of mental states that led to a certain mistake: Previous+,Present G+ Undesirable s t a t e - s t a t e T A c t i o n I SU PPRESSO R We could prevent the undesired action from taking place by introducing an agent that recognizes the state which, in the past, preceded the undesired action. Suppressor-agen ts wait until you get a certain \"bod idea.\" Then they prevent your taiiig the cinesponding action, and make you wait until you think of some alternative. lf a suppressor could speak, it would say, \"Stop thinking that!\" Suppressors could indeed prevent us from repeating actions that we've learned are bad. But It is inlfficient to wait until we actually reach undesirable states, then have to \"backtrack.\" It would be more efficient to anticipate such lines of thought so that we never reach those states at all. In the next section we'll see how to do this by using agents called censors. Censor-agents need not wait until a certain bad idea occurs; instead, they inter- cept the iates of mind that usually precede that thought. lf a censor could speak, it would sdy, \"Don't even begin to think that!\" Though censors were conceived of long ago by Sigmund Freud, they're scarcely mentioned i1 present-day psychology. I suspect that this is a serious oversight and that censors play fundamental roles in how we learn and how we think. Perhaps the trouble is that our censors work too well. For, naturally, it is easier for psychologists to study only what someone does- instead of what someone doesn't do. C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S 275\n27.3 CENSORS To see what suppressors and censors have to do, we must consider not only the mental states that actually occur, but others that might occur under slightly different circumstances. Previous state Possible state Possible state Present state Possible state Possible state su PP FESSO R t- u'l:;,';io'' Suppressors work by interceding to prevent actions iust before they would be performed. This leads to a certain loss of time, because nothing can be done until acceptable alternatives can be found. Censors avoid this waste of time by interceding earlier. Instead of waiting until an action is about to occur, and then shutting it off, a censor operates earlier, when theie still remains time to select alternatives. Then, instead of blocking the course of thought, the censor can merely deflecf it into an acceptable direction. Accordingly, no time is lost. Clearly, censors can be more efficient than suppressors, but we have to pay a price for this. The farther back we go in time, the larger the variety of ways to reach \"\"\"h unwanted state of mind. Accordingly, to prevent a particular mental state from occurring, 2n early-acting censor must learn to recognize all the states of mind that might preced e it. Thus, each censor-mal, in time, require a substantial memory bank For all we know, each person accumulates millions of censor memories, to avoid the thought-patterns found to be ineffectual or harmful. Why not move farther back in time, to deflect those undesired actions even earlier? Then intercepting agents could have even larger effects with smaller efforts and, by selecting good paths early enough, we could solve complex problems without making any mistakesll ail. Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished only by using censors. This is because as we extend a c,ensor's range back into time, the amount of inhibitory memory that would be needed (in order to prevent turns in every possible wrong direction) would grow exponentially. To solve a complex problem, it is not enough to know what might go wrong. One alio needs some positive plan. As I mentioned before, it is easier to notice what your mind does than to notice what it doesn't do, and this means that we can't use introspection to perceive the work of these inhibi- tory agencies. I suspect that this effect has seriously distorted our conceptions of psychology and that once we recognize the importance of censors and other forms of \"rr.g\"tivi ieco gniz- ers,\" we'll find that they constitute large portions of our minds. Sometimes, though, our censors and suppressors must themselves be suppressed. In order to sketch out long-range plans, for example, we must adopt a style of thoughithat clears the mind of trivia and sets minor obstacles aside. But that could be very hard to do if too many censors remained on the scene; they'd make us shy away from strategies that aren't guaranteed to work, and tear apart our sketchy plans before we can start to accomplish them.

But sequence ravelled out of reach Like balls uPon the floor. - E v n l v D I C K I N S o N We spend our lives at learning things, yet always find exceptions and mistakes. Certainty seems always out of reach. This means that we have to take some risks to keep from being paralyzed by cowardice. But to keep from having accidents, we must accumulate two comple- mentary types of knowledge: We search for \"islands of consistency\" within which ordinary reasoning seems safe. We work also to find and mark the unsafe boundaries of those domains. In civilized communities, appointed guardians post signs to warn about sharp turns, thin ice, and animals that bite. And so do our philosophers, when they report to us their paradoxical discoveries-those tales of the Liar who admits to lying and the Barber who shaves all the people who do not shave themselves. These valuable lessons teach us which thoughts we shouldn't think; they are the intellectual counterparts to Freud's emotion censors. It is interest- ing how frequently we find paradoxical nonsense to be funny, and when we come to the section on jokes, we'll see why this is so. When we look closely, we find that most iokes are concerned with taboos, injuries, and other ways of coming to harm-and logical absurdities can also lead to harm. We tell our children not to cross the road unless they are sure no car is coming. But what do we mean by \"sure\"? No one can ever really \"prove\" that no car is coming, since there is no way to rule out the possibility that some mad scientist has found a way to make cars invisible. In ordinary life we have to deal with \"usual\" instead of \"true.\" All we can really ask a child to do is \"look both wdys before you cross.\" In the real world, it makes no sense to ask for absolute certainty. Unfortunately there are no simple, foolproof ways to get around the inconsistencies of com- mon, sense. Accordingly, we each must learn specific ways to keep from various mistakes. Why can't we do that logically? The answer is that perfect logic rarely works. One difficulty is finding foolproof rules for reasoning. But the more serious problem is that of finding foolproof bases for our arguments. It is virtually impossible to state any facts about the real world that actually are always true. We observed this when we discussed \"Birds can Fly.\" This statement applies to typical birds, but not to birds imprisoned in small cages, chained with leg irons, or under the influence of high-gravity fields. Similarly, when you're told, \"Rover is a dog,\" you'll assume that Rover has a tail, since your frame for a typical dog has a terminal for a tail. But should you learn that Rover lacks a tail, your mind won't self-destruct; instead, you'll change your Rover- f13ms-but still expect most other dogs to keep their tails. Exceptions are a fact of life because few \"facts\" are always true. Logic fails because it tries to find exceptions to this rule. C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S 277\n27.5 JOKES Two villagers decided to go bird hunting. They packed their guns and set out with their dog into the fields. Near evening, with no success at att, one said to the other, \"we must be doing something lvrong.\" \"yes,\" agreed the friend,,,perhaps we,re not throwing the dog high enough.\" Why do jokes have such peculiar psychological effects? In 1905, Sigmund Freud published a book explaining that we form censors in our -indr as barriers againstlorbidden thoughts. Most iokes, he said, a_re stories designed to fool the censors. A joke's fo*., \"o-., from \" d\".r\"riftio' that fits two different frames at once. The first meaning -uri be transparent and innotent, while the second meaning is disguised and reprehensiSle. The \".rro6 recognize only the innocent meaning because they are too simple-minded to penetrate the forbidten meaning's disguise. Then, once that first interpretation is firmly planted in the mind, a final turn of word or phrase suddenly replaces it with the other one. Th. \".rrsored thought has been slifped through; a prohibited wish has been enjoyed. Freud suggested that children construct censors in response to prohibitions by their parents or peers' This explains why so many iokes involve taboos conceining cruelty, sexualiiy, and other subjects that human communities typically link to guilt, disgust, J, shame. But it troubled Freud that this theory did not account for the \"nonsens. |ok.r\" p\"opi\" seem to enjoy so much. The trouble was that these seemed unrelated to social prohibitions, He could not'explair, *hy people find humor in the idea of \"d knife that has lost both its blade and its handle.\" Freud considered several explanations to account for pointless nonsense jokes but concluded that none of those theories wa_s good enough. One theory was that people tell nonsense ;ot \", for the pleasure of arousing the expectation of a real ioke and then fiustrating the listener. Another theory was that senselessness reflects \"a wish to return to carefree childhood, when one was permitted to think without any compulsion to be logical, and to put words together without sense, for the simpler pleasures of rhythm or rhyme. \"-Freud put it thi, *\"y, Little by little the child is forbidden this enioyment, till there remain only signif- icant combinations of words. But attempts still emerge to disregard restrictions which were learned. In yet a third theory, F reud coniectured that humor is a way to ward off suffering-as when, in desperate situations, we make iokes as though the world were nothing but a game. Freud suggested that this is when the superego tries to comfort the childlike ego by ref ecting all reality; but he was uneasy about this idea because such kindliness conflicted with his iniage of the superego's usual stern, strict character. Despite Freud's,complicated doubts, I'll argue that he was right all along. Once we recog nize that ordindry thinking, too, requires censors to suppress ineffectual menLl pro\"\"sses, then all the different-seeming forms of jokes will seem more similar. Absurd results tf ,\"rrorring must be tabooed as thoroughly as social mistakes and inanities! And that's why stupid thouglits can seem as humorous as antisocial ones. 278 C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S\n27.6 HUMOR AND CENSORSHIP people often wonder if a computer could ever have a sense of humor. This question seems natural to those who think of humor as a pleasant but unnecessary luxury. But I'll argue quite the opposite-that humor has a practical and possibly essential function in how we learn. When we learn in a serious context, the result is to change connections dmong ordinary agents. But when we learn in a humorous context, the principal result is to change the connections that involve our censors and suppressors. In other words, my theory is that humor is involved with how our censors learn; it is mainly involved with \"rr\"g\"tiue\" th-inking, though people rarely realize this. Why use such a distinct and peculiar medi,r- \", humor for this purpose? Because we must make a sharp distinction between our positive, action-oriented memories and the negative, inhibitory memories embod- ied in our censors. Positiye memory-ogents must learn which mental states are desiroble. I,{egative memory-agents must learn which mental states are undesirable. Because these two types of learning required different processes, it was natural to evolve social signals to communicate that distinctircn. When people do things that we regard as good, *, ,p\"rf to them in encouraging tones-and this switches on their positive learning machinery. However, when people do things we consider stupid or wrong, we then complain in scornful tones or laugh derislvely; this r*it.h.r on their negative learning machinery. I suspect that scolding arrdlaughing have somewhat different effects: scolding tends to produce suppressors' but laulhing ten\"ds to produce censors. Accordingly, the effect of derisive humor is somewhat more hlely to disrupt our present activity. This is because the process of constructing a censor deprives us of the use of o,r, temporary memories, which must be frozen to maintain the records of our recent states of mind. Suppressors merely need to learn which mental states are undesirable- Censors must remember and learn which mental states were undesirable. To see why humor is so often concerned with prohibition, consider that our most productive forms of thought are just the ones most subject to mistakes. We can make fewer errors by confining o,rrr\"lues to cautious, \"logical\" reasoning, but we'll also discover fewer new ideas. More \"\"i-r b. gained by using metaphors and analogies, even though they are often defective and misleading. I think this is why so many jokes are based on recognizing inappropriate comparisons. Why, by the way, do we so rarely recognize the negative character of humor itself? perhaps it has a funny side effect: while shutting off those censored thoughts, our censors also shut off thoughts about themselves-and make themselves invisible. This solves Freud's problem about nonsense iokes. The taboos that grow within social com- munities can be learned only from other people. But when it comes to intellectual mistakes' a child needs no helpful friend to scold it when a tower falls, when it puts a spoon in its ear, or thinks a thought that sets its mind into a fruitless and confusing loop. In other words, we can detect many of o,tt own intellectual failures all by ourselves. Freud's theorv of iokes was based on the idea that censors suppress thoughts that would be considered \"naughty\" by those to whom we are attached. He must simply have overlooked the fact that ineffectual reasoning is equally \"naughty\"-2nd therefore equally \"funny\"-in the sense that it, too, ought to be suppressed. Thete is no need for our censors to distinguish between social incompetence and intellectual stupidity. C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S 279\n27.7 I.AUGHTER What would a Martian visitor think to see a human being laugh? It must look truly horrible: the sight of furious gestures, flailing limbs, and thorax heavfng in frenzied contortions. The air is torn with dreadful sounds as though, all at once, that person wheezes, barks, and chokes to death' The face contorts in grimaces that mix smil.r rnd yawns with snarls and frowns. What could cause such a frightful seizure? Our theory suggests a simple answer: The function of laughing is to disrupt another person's reasoning! To see and hear a person laugh creates such chaos in the mind that you can't proceed along your present train of thought. Derision makes you feel ridiculous; it prevents yol from \"being serious.\" what happens then? our theory has a second part: Laughter focuses attention on the present state of mind! Laughter seems to freeze one's present state of mind in its tracks and hold it up to ridicule. All further reasoning is disrupted, and only the joke-thought remains in sharp focus. What is the function of this petrifying effect? By preventing you from \"taking seriously\" your present thought, and thus proceed- ing to develop it, laughter gives you time to build d censor against that state of mind. In order to construct or improve a censor, you must retain your records of the recent states of mind that made you think the censored thought. This takes some time, during which your short-term memories are fully occupied-and that will naturally disrupt whichev\"er other pro- cesses might try to change those memories. How could all this have evolved? Like smiling, laughter has a curious ambiguity, combining elements of affection and conciliation with elements of reiection and rggr\"riion. Perhaps al1 these ancestral means of social communication became fused to compoi\" \" single, absolutely irresistible way to make another person cease an activity regarded as objlctionable or ridiculous. If so, it is no accident that so many iokes mix elements of pleasure, cruelty, sexuality, aggres- sion, and absurdity. Humor must have grown along with our abilities to criticize o,rrr.lu.r, starting with simple internal suppressors that evolved into more sophisticated censors. Perhaps they then split off into B-brain layers that became increasingly able to predict and manipulate what the older A-brains were about to do. At this point, our ancestors must have staried to experience what humanists call \"conscience. \" For the first time, animals could start to reflect upon their own mental activities and evaluate their purposes, plans, and goals. This endowed us with great new mental powers but, at the same time, exposed us to new and different kinds of conceptual mistakes and inefficiencies. Our humor-agencies become internalized in adult life as we learn to produce the same effects entirely inside our own minds. We no longer need the ridicule of those other people, once we can make ourselves ashamed by laughing silently at our own mistakes. 280 C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S\n27.8 GOOD HUMOR Some readers might object that the censor-learning theory of iokes is too narrow to be an explanation of humor in general. What of all the other roles that humor plays in occasions of \"nloy*\"nt and companionship? Our answer is the same as usual: we can't expect any single, simple theory to explain adult psychology. To ask how humor works in a grown-up person is to askio* everything works in a grown-up person, since humor gets involved with so many other things. I didn't mean to suggest that every aspect of humor is involved in making censors learn. When humor evolved, \"r *h..t any other mechanism develops in biology, it must have been built upon other mechanisms that already existed, and embodied mixtures of those other functions. |ust as the voice is used for many social purposes, the mechanisms involved in humor are also used for other effects that are less involved with memory. In later life the effect of \"functional autonomy\" can make it hard to recognize the original function not only of humor, but of many other aspects of adult psychology. To understand how feelings work, we need to understand both their evolutionary and their individual histories. We've seen how important it is for us to learn about mistakes. To keep from making old mistakes ourselves, we learn about them from our families and friends. But a peculiar problem arises when we tell another person that something is wrong, for if this is interpreted as an expression of disapproval and rejection, it can evoke a sense of pain and loss-and lead to wilhdrawal and avoidance. Accordingly, to point out mistakes to someone whose loyalty and love we want to keep, we must adopt some pleasant or conciliatory form. Thus humor has evolved its graciously disarming ways to do its basically distasteful iob! You don't want the recipient to rkill the messenger who brings bad new5\"-s5pscially when you're the messenger. M\"ny people seem genuinely surprised when shown that humor is so concerned with un- pleasant,-painful, and disgusting subjects. In a certain sense, there's really nothing humorous about *oit jokes-except, perhaps, in the skill and subtlety with which their dreadful content is disguised; frequently, the thought itself is little more than \"See what happened to somebody else; ior, dren't you glad it wasn't yor.t?\" In this sense most f okes are not actually frivolous at all but reflect the most serious of concerns. Why, by the wdy, are jokes usually less funny when heard again? Because the censors learn some more each time and prepare to act more quickly and effectively. Why, then, do certain kinds of jokes, particularly those about forbidden sexual subiects, seem to remain persistently funny to so many people? Why do those censors remain unchanged for so long? Here we can reuse our explanation of the prolonged persistence of attachment, infat- uation, sexuality, and mournin g-grief; because these areas relate to self-ideals, their memories, once formed, are slow to change. Thus the peculiar robustness of sexual humor may mean only that the censors of human sexuality are among the \"slow learners\" of the mind, like retarded children. In fact, we could argue that they literally ore retarded children-that is, they are among the frozen remnants of our earlier selves. 28r C E N S O R S A N D J O K E S\nCHAPTER 2E THE MIND AND THE I^IORLD FLUX Each event is quite unique.

It almost seems as though bui feelings can accumulate like fluids bottled up inside. In earlier times, some scientists identified th\"r. quantities with substances like bile and blood. No one believes those theories now-yet still we often speak of having mental energy and momentum or of succumbing to depletion or inertia. Do 'lmental quantities\" really exist within the mind? If so, how are they -\"d\" and stored, brought forth and then spent? And what are their relations to the quantities and magnitudes *. ,\"rd about in technical books? The answer is that words like \"energy\" and \"force\" ire not used with much precision in everyday psychology. They still have the connota- tions that they carried several centuries ago, when they referred to commonsense ideas about vitality. Then, \"energy\" referred to vigor of action and expression, and \"force\" referred to the binding strength of a commitment or to the fighting strength of an army. Modirn scientists use a concept of energy that, though narrower and more precise, not only explains more perfectly why engines stop when they run out of fuel, but also applies to our bodies as well: each of the cells of which we're made, including those inside the brain, requires some chemical energy in the form of food and oxygen. Accordingly, the body as a whole can do only a limited amount of physical work before it needs another meal. Now many people naively assume that our higherJevel mental processes have similar requirements and that they need some second form of fuel-a mythical form of mental energy-to keep from becoming bored or mentally exhausted. And yet that simply isn't true! If each of Builder's agents has physical energy enough to do its work, then Builder-as an agency-needs nothing more to do its-work. Buitder. after all, is but a name for a certain assembly of agents. It can't require anything its separate agents do not need. Machines and brains require ordinary energy to do their iobs-ond need no other, mental forms of energy. Causality is quite enough to keep them working toward their goals. But if our higher-level processes require no extra quantities like fuels or energies, what makes it seem to us as though they do? Why do so many people talk about their \"levels of mental or emotional energy\"? Why do tedious and boring occupations make us feel \"run down\"? We all experience so many such phenomena that we cannot help thinking our minds depend on many kinds of \"mental quantities\"-yet scientists apparently have shown that no such quantities exist. How can we explain this? It is not enough to say, simply, that these phenomena are illusions; we must understand why the illusions appear and, if possible, determine what func- tions they serve. The next few sections show how various illusions of mental force and energy evolve as convenient ways for mental agencies to regulate their transactions, much as many human communities have discovered how to use money. T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D 283\n28.2 MAGNITUDE AND MARKETPI.ACE How can a hurt be canceled by a kiss? How can an insult \"add\" to injury? Why do we so often speak as though our wishes and desires were like forces, which increase one another's effects when they're aligned but cancel out when they're opposed? I'll argue that this is because, at every moment of our lives, we're forced to choose between alternatives we can't compare. Suppose, for example, that you must choose between two homes: one of them offers a moun- tain view; the other is closer to where you work. It really is a strange idea that two such unrelated things as nearness to work and beautiful scenery could be Jo-p\"r.d at all. But a person could instead assess that pleasant, restful view as worth a certain amount of travel time. Instead of comparing the items themselves, you could simply compare how much time they seem to be worth. We turn to using quantities when we can't compare the qualities of things. This waY, for better or for worse, we often assign some magnitude or price to each alternative. That tactic helps to simplify our lives so much that virtually every social community works out its own communal measure-schemes-let's call them currencies-that let its p\"opi\" work and trade in harmoly, even though each individual has somewhat different perional goals. The establishment of a currency can foster both competition and cooperation by providing us with peaceful ways to divide and apportion the things we have to share. But who can set prices on things like time or measure the values of comfort and love? What makes our mental marketplaces work so well when emotional states seem so hard to compare? One reason is that no matter how different those mental conditions seem, they must ail lom- pete for certain limited resources-such as space, time, and energy-and thlse, to a rather large extent, are virtually interchangeable. Foi example, you'd \"\"d \"p with essentially the same result whether you measure things in terms of food or time-because it takes time to find food, and each amount of food helps you survive for some amount of time. Thus the value we place on each commodity constrains, to some extent, the values we'll assign to many other kinds of goods. Because there are so many such constraints, once a community sets up a currency, that currency takes on a life of its own, and soon we start to treat our \"wealth\" ai though it were a genuine commodity, a real substance that we can use, save, lend, or waste. In a similar way, a group of agencies inside the brain could exploit some \"amount\" to keep account of their transactions with one another. Indeed agencies need such techn-iques even more than people do, because they are less able to appreciate each other's concerns. But if agents had to \"p^y their way,\" what might they use for currency? One family of agents might evolve ways to exploit their common access to some chemical that is available in limiled quantities; another family of agents might contrive to use a quantity that doesn't actually exist at all, but whose amount is simply \"computed.\" I suspect that what we call the pleasure of success may be, in effect, the currency of some such scheme. To the extent that success is interchangeable with time or food or energy, it's useful to treat pleasure as equivalent to wealth. 284 T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D\n28.3 QT'ANTITY AND QUAIJTY We've scarcely mentioned at all inside this book the kinds of quantities that could be \"mea- 5s1sd\"-though surely brain cells use them all the time. For example, it seems quite likely that many of our agents employ quantitative schemes for summarizing evidence or establishing the strengths of connections. But I have said little about such matters because I suspect that such matters play diminished roles, the more we move toward higher-level operations of the mind. This is because whenever we're forced to compare magnitudes, we have to pay a heavy price: it tends to terminate what we call \"thinking. \" Whenever we turn to measurements, we forfeit some uses of intellect. Currencies and magnitudes help us make comparisons only by concealing the differences dmong what they purport to represent. By their nature, quantitative descriptions are so one-dimensional and featureless that they cannot help but conceal the structures that give rise to them. This is inescapable, since any act that makes two different things comparable must do it by deflecting our attention from their differences. Numbers themselves are the greatest masters of disguise because they perfectly conceal all traces of their origins. Add five and eight to make thirteen, and tell that answer to a friend: thirteen will be all your friend can know, since no amount of ingenious thought can ever show that it came from adding five and eightt It's much the same inside the head: quanti- tative f udgments help us make decisions only by keeping us from thinking too much about the actual evidence. No matter that such judgments have faults; you often have no choice but to choose. This happens when you can't stay where you are and must turn either right or left. Somewhere in some agencies, alternatives must be compared-and sometimes one can find no way except by using currencies. Then, various agents in your brain may turn to whatever quantities-chemi- cal, electrical, or whatever-that happen to be available. Atty substance or quantity whose availability is limited can be made to serve as a currency. But when we make our theories about how such systems work, we simply must remember not to make the easy mistake of confusing those quantities with their adopted functions and thus, for example, believing that certain drugs are inherently \"stimulating\" or \"depressing,\" or that certain foodstuffs are inherently more \"natural ,\" o, more \"healthy.\" Most of the properties of a currency are not inherent-but merely conventional. In any case, we should never assume that the quality or character of a thought process depends directly on the nature of the circumstances that evoke it. There is no quality of \"sweetness\" inherent in sugar itself, which is a mere chemical. Its quality of sweetness is, in effect, a currency involved with certain agencies that are connected to sensors that detect the presence of sugar. Those agencies evolved that way because whenever we have hunger goals, it pays to recognize the taste of sugar as a \"sign of success\"-5is1ply because sugar itself supplies energy, is easy to detect, and usually indicates the presence of other edible sources of nutrition. Similarly, inside our brains, many agencies have come to influence one another by controlling the amounts of various chemicals in much the way that many kinds of human transactions have come to use substances like candy, coins, or bags of salt-or banknotes backed by promises. T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D 285\n28.4 MIND OVER MATTER It seems completely natural to us that we should feel pain when we're injured or hunger when we're deprived of food. Such feelings seem to us to be inherent in those predicam.rrtr. Then why doesn't a car feel pain when its tire is punctured or feel hungry when its fuel runs low? The answer is that pain and hunger are nof inherent in being iniured or starve d,: such feelings must be \"engineered.\" These physical circumstances do not Jirectly produce the states of mind they arouse; on the contrary, this depends upon intricate networks of agencies and nerve-bundles that took millions of years to evolve. We have no conscious senr\" tf that ma- chinery. When your skin is touched, it seems as though it were your sftin that feels-and not your brain-because you're unaware of everything that happens in between. In order for hunger to keep us fed, it must engage some agency that gives priority to food- acquiring goals. But unless such signals came before our fuel reserves were entiiely gone, they'd arrive too late to have any use. This is why feeling hungry or tired is not the same as being genuinely starved or exhausted. To serve as useful \"warning signs,\" feelings like pain and hunger must be engineered not simply to indicate dangerous condiiions, but ti anticifate them and warn us before too much damage is done. But what about the feelings of depression and discouragement we get when stuck at boring iobs or with problems we cannot solve? Such feelings resemble those that accompany physical fatigue, but they do not signify genuine depletions because they often easily t.rporrd to changes of context, interest, and schedule. Nevertheless, the similarity would be no accident, for proU- ably those feelings arise because our higherlevel brain centers have evolved connections that exploit our ancient fuel-exhaustion warning systems. After all, the unproductive use of time is virtually equivalent to wasting hard-earned energy! Now what about those incidents in which some person seems to go beyond what we supposed were the normal bounds of endurance, strength, or tolerance of pain? We like to believe this demonstrates that the force of will can overrule the physical laws that govern the world. But a person's ability to persist in circumstances we hadn't thought were tolerable need not indicate anything supernatural. Since our feelings of pain, depression, exhaustion, and discouragement are themselves mere products of our minds' activities-and ones that are engineered tt warn us before we reach our ultimate limits-we need no extraordinary power of mind over matter to overcome them. It is merely a matter of finding ways to rearrange our priorities. In any case, what hurts-and even what is \"felt\" at all-may, in the end, be more dependent upon culture than biology. Ask anyone who runs a marathon, or ask your favorite Amazon. 286 T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D\n28.5 THE MIND AND THE ITVORLD We spend our lives in several realms. The first is the ordinary physical world of \"objects\" that exist in space and time. Objects obey simple laws. When any object moves or changes, we can usually account for it in terms of other objects pushing it, or else of gravity or wind. We also live in a social realm of persons, families, and companies; those entities appear to be ruled by quite different kinds of causes and laws. Whenever a person moves or changes, we look for signs of intentions, ambitions, infatuations, promises, threats, and the like-none of which could affect a brick. We also live in a psychological realm-inhabited by entities we call by names like \"meanings,\" \"ideas,\" and \"memories.\" These, too, appear to obey different rules. The causes in the physical realm seem terribly different from those that work in the social and psychological realms-so different that they seem to belong to different worlds. Physlcal Realm Mental Realm In some respects our bodies act exactly like ordinary objects: they have shapes we can see and touch, and they have locations that change when we're dropped or pushed. Yet in other ways, our bodies act quite differently from other things, and this aPpears to be because of minds. But what on earth are minds? For ages people have wondered about the relationship between the mind and body; some philosophers became so desperate as to suggest that only the mental world is real and the real world is merely an illusion. (That idea just makes the problem worse, because it can't even explain why there seems to be a physical world.) Most thinkers have ended up with images that portray two different kinds of worlds, one of matter and one of mind, somehow connected by mysterious threads of spiritual causality, somewhat like the films and tendrils formed when sticky stuff is pulled apart. Certain modern physicists have even speculated that these connections are somehow involved with the \"uncertainty principle\" in physics, perhaps because that problem also confounds their usual conceptions of causality. I i\"\" no merit in such ideas because as far as I'm concerned, the so-called problem of body and mind does not hold any mystery: Minds are simply what brains do. Whenever we speak about a mind, we're speaking of the processes that carry our brains from state to state. And this is what makes minds appear to us so separate from their physical embodiments: it is because concerns about minds are really concerns with relationships between states-and this has virtually nothing to do with the natures of the states themselves. This is why we can understand how a society of agents like Builder will work without knowing the physical constitution of its agents: what happens depends only on how each agent changes its state in response to its previous state and those of the other agents that connect to it. Other than that, it does not matter in the least what are the individual agents'colors, sizes, shapes, or any other properties that we could sense. So naturally minds seem detached from physical existence. It doesn't matter what agents are;it only matters what they do-and what they are connected to. T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D 287\n28.6 MINDS AND MACHINES Why does a mind seem so unlike any other kind of thing? First, as we iust said, minds dren't things-at least they share none of the usual properties of things, like colors, sizes, shapes, or weights. Minds lie beyond the reach of the senses of sound, touch, sight, smell, and tasie. yet though minds aren't things at all, they certainly have vital links to the things we call brains. What is the nature of those bonds? Are minds peculiar entities, possessed alone by brains like ours? Or could those qualities of minds be shared, to various degrees, by everyihingZ Now, when we said, \"Minds are simply what brains do,\" that should have made us ask as *el'i, \"Daes every other kind of process also have a conesponding kind of mind?\" This could lead to an argument. One side might insist that this is merely a matter of degree, because people have well-developed minds while bricks or stones have almost none. Anoiher side mighi tri to draw a sharper boundary, arguing that only people can have minds-and, maybe, certain animals. Which side is right? This isn't a matter of wrong or right, since the issue is-not about a fact, but only about when it's wise to use a certain word. Those who wish to reserve the label \"mindi'for only certain processes are obliged to specify which processes deserve that name. Those who claim that every kind of process has a corresponding type of mind are obliged to classify all minds and processes. The trouble with this is that we don't yet have adequati ways to classify processes. Why are Processes so hard to classify? In earlier times, we could usually ludge machines and processes by how they transformed raw materials into finished products. But ii makes no sense to speak of brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factories make cars. The difference is that brains :use processes that change tiemselves-and this means we cannot separate such processes from the products they produce. In particular, brains make memories, which change the ways we'll subsequently think The principal activities of brains (ne making changes in themselves. Because the whole idea of self-modifying processe, i, ,r\"* to our expe- rience, we cannot yet trust our commonsense judgments about iuch matters. As for brain science, no one ever before tried to study machines with billions of working parts. That would be difficult enough, even if we knew exactly how every part worked, and our present-day technology does not yet allow us to study the biain cells oi irigtr\"r animals while they're actually working and learning. This is partly because those cells \"r..\"*tr\"mely small and sensitive to injury, and partly because they are so crowded together that we have ntt yet b\"., able to map out their interconnections. These problems will all be solved once we have better instruments and better theories. In the meantime, the hardest problems we have to face do not come from philosophical questions about whether brains are machines or not. There is not the slightest reason to doubt that brains are anything other than machines with enormous numbers of parts that work in perfect accord with physical laws. As far as anyone can tell, our minds \"r. --.r.ly complex processes. The serious problems come from our having had so little experience wiih ,rr\"\"hirr.i of such com- plexity that we are not yet prepared to think effectively about them. 288 T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D\n28.7 INDTVIDUAT IDENTITIES Suppose I had once borrowed your boat and, secretly, replaced each board with a similar but different one. Then, later, when I brought it back, did I return your boat to you? What kind of question is that? It's really not about boats at all, but about what people mean by \"same.\" For \"same\" is never absolute but always a matter of degree. If I had merely changed one plank, we'd all agree that it's still yourboat-but after allits parts are changed, we're not so sure of its identity. In any case, we do not doubt that the second boat will behave in much the same way -to the extent that all those substituted boards are suitably equivalent. What has this to do with brains? Well, now suppose that we could replace each of your brain cells with a specially designed computer chip that performs the same functions, and then suppose that we interconnect these devices iust as your brain cells are connected. If we put it in the same environment, this new machine would reproduce the same processes as those within your brain. Would that new machine be the sdme as you? Again, the real question is not what we mean by \"you,\" but what we mean by \"same.\" There isn't any reason to doubt that the substitute machine would think and feel the same kinds of thoughts and feelings that you do-since it embodies all the same processes and memories. Indeed, it would surely be disposed to declare, with all your own intensity, that it ls you. Would that machine be right or wrong? As far as I can see, this, too, is merely a matter of words. A mind is a way in which each state gives rise to the state that follows it. If that new machine had a suitable body and were placed in a similar environment, its sequence of thoughts would be essentially the same as yours- since its mental states would be equivalent to yours. Modifying or replacing the physical parts of a brain will not affect the mind it embodies, unless this alters the successlons of states in that brain. You might object to this idea about duplicating minds on the grounds that it would never be practical to duplicate enough details. You could argue the same about that borrowed boat: no mattpr how carefully a carpenter were to copy every board, there would always remain some differences. This plank would be a little too stiff, that one would be a little too weak, and no two of them would bend in exactly the same way.The copied boat would never be precisely the same-even though you might need a microscope to see the differences. For similar reasons, it would be impractical to duplicate, with absolute fidelity, all the interactions in a brain. For example, our brain cells are all immersed in a liquid that conducts electricity, which means that every cell has at least a small effect on every other cell. If we tried to imitate your brain with a network of computer chips, many of those tiny interactions would be left out. Can you then boast that your duplicated brain-machine would not have the same mind as yours because its computer chips don't work exactly like the brain cells they purport to replace? No; you'd get more than you bargained for if you argued that the new machine was not the same as you, merely because of microscopic differences. Consider that as you age, you're never the same as a moment ago. If such small differences matter that much, this would prove that you yourself are not the same as you. T H E M I N D A N D T H E W O R T D 289\n28.8 OVERI.APPING MINDS Consider the popular idea that a person is capable brain\" kind and a \"left brain\" kind-as though there human brain. This raises some odd questions, since nary boundaries through brains. of two kinds of thinking at once-a \"right were two different individuals inside each there are many other ways to draw imagi- If you agree that each person has both a left-brain mind and right-brain mind, then you must also agree that each person also has a front-brain mind and a back-brain mind! Can a single large mind contain so many smaller ones, with overlapping boundaries? It makes sense to think of part of a structure as being a \"thing\" in its own right only when the relationships among parts of that structure have some significant type of coherency. Before you'd say that a certain arbitrary section of brain contains a mind, you'd want to have some evidence that what happens inside that boundary is something you would consider to be a mind. The less another entity resembles you, the less it means for you to say that it, like you, must have a mind. Do our very smallest agencies have minds? No, because it would make no more sense to say this than to say that two trees form a forest or that two bricks form a wall. But there are indeed some agencies inside our brains that do have humanlike abilities to solve, by them- selves, some types of problems that we regard as hard. For example, your agencies for locomo- tion, vision, and language may contain within their boundaries some processes that are quite as intricate as those \"you\" use for your own conscious thought. Possibly, some of those pro- cesses are actually more \"conscious\" than you are yourself, in the sense that they maintain and use even more complete records of their own internal activities. Yet what happens in those agencies is so sealed off that you have no direct experience of how \"yo.r\" distinguish a cat from a dog, retrace \"your\" last few steps, or listen and talk without knowing how \"yo,r\" do it. All this suggests that it can make sense to think there exists, inside your brain, a society of different minds. Like members of a family, the different minds can work together to help each other, each still having its own mental experiences that the others never know about. Several such agencies could have many agents in common, yet still have no more sense of each other's interior activities than do people whose apartments share opposite sides of the same walls. Like tenants in a rooming house, the processes that share your brain need not share one another's mental lives. If each of us contains several such mini-minds, could any special exercise help put them all \"in closer touch\"? Certainly there are ways to become selectively aware of processes that are usually not conscious at all. But becoming aware of everything that happens in brains would leave no room for thought. And the reports of those who claim to have developed such skills seem singularly uninformative. If anything, they demonstrate that it's even harder than we think to penetrate those unresisting barriers.

Each view has its own questions. Separate views speak mostly past each other. Occasionally, of course, they speak to the sdme issue and then comparison is possible, but not often and not on demand. - A L L E N N e w e r - r -\n29.I THE REATMS OF THOUGHT Our view of the body and the mind as separate entities is only one example of our many ways to view the world as divided into different realms. Imagine that a committee were commissioned to write down everything about the universe in a perfectly organized book. This suggests how people think abaut the world. The \"pages\" represent our physical, personal, and psychological conceptions, while the lines on each page correspond to the levels of detail that are distinguished in each realm. Why do the gaps between the lines seem smaller than those that separate the pages? It is because we better understand what happens in between. We understand how walls relate to bricks because they represent closely related \"levels of organization.\" Similarly, we understand the relation between houses and walls. But it would be hard to cross the gap between houses and bricks without having enough intermediate concepts such as that of a wall. It simply isn't practical to think of the place where someone lives as a network of relationships among a million boards and bricks. It's much the same in other realms; we need to be able to describe things at many levels of detail. We all belong to families or companies, and sometimes we can think of each group as \"nothing but\" a network of agreements and relationships. But when we need a larger view, as when thinking about the politics of an entire country, we cannot think effectively without regarding entire families or companies as though they were single objects in a different realm. The same applies to how we think about our minds. Even if you knew all the details of each little agent in your brain, your higher-level processes would still need coarser summaries. Why is it easier to understand how walls relate to bricks, or families to individuals, than to understand how thoughts relate to things? It's not because there's any single mystery. It is because the level gap between walls and bricks is really much smaller than that between minds and brain cells. Suppose we actually had that wonderful encyclopedia of \"all possible knowl- edge,\" arranged according to the nearness of topics. There we'd find the essays on walls quite close to those about bricks. But the sections that cover the nature of thouehts would lie volumes away from the ones on the nature of things. ffi*.ucar\"' sifittutu' ,f'6;tt *.1.1.., iti*' F,,, Pe, rl€s tqk . lriiil Mifi!. rd edil , 292 T H E R E A T M S O F T H O U G H T\n29.2 SE\\IERAL THOUGHTS AT ONCE To see that we can think in several mental realms at once, consider the role of the word \"give\" in this simple sentence: Mary gives lack the kite. We can see at least three distinct meanings here. First, we could represent the idea of the kite's motion through physical space by using a Trans-frame who se Traiectory begins at Mary's hand and ends at )ack's. r\\ Origin \\ ) / \\ 6\"rtt) gtio!, Trajec-):...,., lorv f \".'.' \\ - - ' r - l Mary's hand The kite Jack's hand But quite beyond that realm of space, we also find a different significance in what Mary did -in another realm that we'll call \"estates.\" This involves a different sense of \"give,\" in which the object need not actually move at all! Instead, what happens is the transfer of its ownership. a\\ Origin \\ - / / \\ /5\"rti) gio, v-'7 Mary's estate The kite's ownership Jack's-estate Each of us has an \"s5[a[s\"-the collection of possessions we control. And this \"realm of estate\" is more important than it might seem, because it lies between the realms of objects and ideas. In order to carry out our plans, it is not enough only to know what things or ideas are required and how to adapt them to our purposes. We must also be able to take possession of those obiects or ideas, either by right or by might. Possession plays essential roles in all our plans, because we cdn't use dny materials, tools, or ideas until we gain control of them. We can also interpret Mary's act within a social realm, in which we understand that giving gifts involves yet other kinds of relationships. No sooner do you hear of Mary's gift than certain parts of your mind become concerned with why she was so generous and how this involved her affections and obligations. r\\ Origin \\ / / \\ 6\".ti) f,ioy Trajec- tn rrr \\ ,/ losition dis Mary's disposit Mary'5 ton How can so many different thoughts proceed at the same time, without interfering with one another? I suspect that it is for the same reason that we have no trouble imagining an apple as both round and red at the same time: in that case, the processes for color and shape use agents that do not compete. Similarly, the different processes involved with ideas like \"give\" may operate in agencies so different that they rarely need to compete for the same resources. T H E R E A T M S O F T H O U G H T 293\n29.3 PARANOMES What enables us to comprehend \"Ma ry gives lack the kite\" in so many ways at once? Differelnt meanings don't conflict when they apply to separate realms-but that can't be quite what's happening here, since the physical, social, and mental realms are closely linked in many ways. So now I'll argue iust the opposite, that these meanings are so similar they don't conflict! Here is my hypothesis about what holds together all these aspects of our thoughts: Many of our higher level conceptual-frames are really parallel drrdys of analogous frames, each actiye in a different realm. Consider all the different roles played by the Actor pronome of our sentence. In the physical 1ealm, the Orlgin of give rs Mary's hand. In the possessional realm of \"give and take,'; that Origin is in Mary's estate-since Mary can only give ]ack what she owns. Similarly, in the physical realm, it is the kite itself that moves from Mary's hand to |ack's; however, in the realm of estates, the kite's ownership is what \"changes hands.\" PHYSICAL POSSESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL superpolynemes for activa.ting memortes superisonomes for controlling level-bands superpronomes for controlling frame-terminals This suggests that certain pronomes can operate in several different realms at once. Let's call them \"paranomes\" to emphasize their parallel activities. When the language-agency activates some polynemes and paranomes, these agents run crosswise through the agencies of various realms to arouse several processes and frames at the same time; these \"ott\"ipond to different interpretations, in different realms, of the same phrase or sentence. Then, because each maior agency contains its own memory-control system, the agencies within each realm can simulta- neously apply their own methods for dealing with the corresponding aspect of the common topic of concern. In this way, a single language-phrase can at the same time evoke different processes involved with social dispositions, spatial images, poetical fancies, musical themes, mathematical structures-or any other assortment of types of thought that don't interfere too much with one another. This is not to say that all these different modes of thought will proceed independently of one another. Whenever any process gains momentary control over a paranome, many otirer pro- cesses can be affected. For example, one agency's memory-control process might thus cause the agencies in several other realms simultaneously to \"blink\" on and off their Origin and Destination paranomes. This would force the agencies active in each of those realms to focus upon whichever types of differences they then discern; then, in between such episodes, each agency can apply its own way of thinking to the corresponding topic, difference, or relationship. By using these cross-connecting polynemes and paranomes, the activity in each realm can proceed sometimes independently, yet at other times influence and be affected by what h\"p- pens in the other realms. 294 T H E R E A T M S O F T H O U G H T\n29.4 CROSS.REAIM CORRESPONDENCES We often describe the things we like as \"elevotedi\"'lofty,\" or \"hedvenly.\" Why do we see such things in terms of altitude in space? We often speak of time itself in spatial terms, as though thi future were \"ahead\" of us while the past remains behind. We think of problems as \"obstlacles\" to go around and turn to using diagrams to represent things that don't have shapes at all. What enables us to turn so many skills to so many other purposes? These tendencies reflect the systematic \"cross-realm correspondences\" embodied in our families of polynemes and paranomes. At each instant, seyeral realms may be engaged in active processing. Each has seporate processes but must compete for control of the ascending nemes that lead into the language-dgency. Which polyneme will ploy the role of Origin in the next sentence-frame? WiIl it be Mary's physical drm or hand, or Mory's social role as party guest? It sometimes seems as though the language-dgency can focus on only one realm at a time. This could be one reason why language scientists find it hard to classify the roles words play in sentence-frames. No sooner does a language-agency assign some polynemes and isonomes to a phrase than various mind divisions proceed to alter how they're used inside each different realm. Every shift of control from one realm to another affects which particular nemes will be next to influence the language-agency. This causes moment-to-moment changes in the appar- ent meaning of a phrase. At one moment, control over langudge may reside in the realm of thought that is working most successfully; at the next moment, it may be the one experiencing the most difficulty. Each shift in attention affects how the various expressions will be interpreted, and this in turn can affect which realm will next take center stage. For example, the sentence \"Mary gives lack the kite\" might start by arousing a listener's concern with Mary's social role as party guest. That would cause the pronomes of a social- frame to represent Mary's obligation to bring a present. But then the listener's possession realm might become concerned with Mary's ownership of that gift or with how she got control of it. This shift from social to possessional concern could then affect the processing of future sen- tences. For example, it will influence whether a phrase like \"fack's kite\" is interpreted to refer to the kite that Jack happens to be holding or to a different kite that fack happens to own. Every mental realm accumulates its own abilities but also discovers, from time to time, how to exploit the skills of other realms. Thus the mind as a whole can learn to exploit the frames developed in the realm of space both for representing events in time and for thinking about social relationships. Perhaps our chaining skills are the best example of this; no matter which realm or realms they originate in, we eventually learn to apply them to any collection of entities, events, or ideas (in any realm whatever) that we can arrange into sequences. Then chains assume their myriad forms, such as spatial order, psychological causality, or social dominance. T H E R E A L M S O F T H O U G H T\n29.5 THE PROBTEM OF UNITY What makes our minds form many separate mental realms, instead of attempting, as scientists do, to see all aspects of the world in a unified way? Because, at least in everyd\"y lif\", the latter simply isn't practical. Consider how different the rules are within the physical and social realms. If you want your furniture inside a different room, you normally would push it there. But when you want to move your party guests, it would be rude to push them there. Contrast the principles of physics and geometry with those we use in the social realm. In the physical realm, the rules seem very orderly: -- A stationdry obiect stays where it is unless another obiect pushes it. --- A moving obiect continues in its course until some external force makes it stop. ---- AII unsupported obiects start to faII. ----- No two things cdn occupy the same location. ----- Etc. These principles seem clear to us-but infants cannot appreciate them until they've built up ways to represent ingredients like \"thing,\" \"shape,\" \"place,\" \"move,\" and \"near.\" It takes each child many years to develop these abilities. Our comprehensions of social acts are based on different principles. When an ordinary obf ect moves around, we usually see an obvious cause; most likely, another object pushed it. But when we see a person move, we rarely see the cause at all-because it's buried in a brain. In predicting how a person will react to an expression or gesture, we have little use for physical properties like color, shape, or place. Instead, we employ almost entirely different conceptions. To guess the outcome of a social interaction, we have to be able to represent each person's mental state-and to do that, we must develop concepts about traits, dispositions, motives, and plans. The concepts that serve so well for physical objects are of little help within the social realm-and vice yersa. When normal children start to talk, among the early aspects of their speech are words that distinguish animate things. Frequently, a child will use a single expression for all kinds of animals, and for everything else that can move by itself-for example, an automobile. Accord- ing to our view of things, this surely is no accident. To adults, the laws that govern the physical world seem simpler and more orderly than those that apply to human events. Does this mean that for infants, too, it should be easier first to master the physical world and later to proceed toward social and psychological understanding? No. Paradoxically, the social realm is initially the easier! Imagine that an infant wants a certain toy and that there's a sympathetic person near. The easiest thing is to make d requesf-that is, a gesture, smile, or cry-and this will probably achieve the goal. It would be far more difficult for the infant to coordinate all the complicated machinery for planning and executing the trajectory for propelling the object from where it is to where the infant wishes it to be. From the point of view of a physically helpless infant, the social realm is by far the simpler one. 296 T I I E R E A T M S O F T H O U G I I T\n29.6 AUTISTIC CHITDREN Isn't it curious that infants find social goals easier to accomplish than physical goals, while adults find the social goals more difficult? One way to explain this is to say that the presence of hetpful people simplifies the infant's social world-since because of them, simpler actions solve h\"td\"t problems. Another explanation might be that the infant's social world is iust as compli- cated \"i thrt of the adult, extept the presence of helpful people makes the infant's mind more powerful-by making the agencies inside those other people's brains available for exploitation ty the agencies in lhe infant's brain. Both explanations are the same, except for drawing different boundaries. How do children start on the path toward distinguishing between psychological and physical relationships? In the appendix ltll suggest that our infant brains are genetically equipped with machineryfor making it .\"ry to learn social signals. But what if that machinery should some- how fail, io that by \"h\"tt\".-or by neglect or accident-the realm-divisions never form? Then all those different kinds of thoughts would fuse together into one-and the child would face the impossible task of formulating principles that work in all domains. A child that tried to see the world without dividing it into realms would find no simple rules at all that work across so large a range. fnir is why each child must learn different rules for the physical and psychological realms. But this means that the child must face not merely two formidable problems, but three. In addition to developing two different sets of concepts, the child must also develop agencies to m(tn(tge those \"on\"\"ptr by keeping them apart in different agencies, as we saw when we talked about Papert's principle. This could explain some aspects of the disorders of the children psychiatrists call \"autistic.\" These unhappy individuals do not establish effective communication with other people, al- though they-may acquire some competence at dealing with physical things. No one knows the \"r,:r.r of those disorders. Some might begin when certain mental realms do not develop normally. Other kinds of problems could emerge after those divisions form, if their separateness were compromised by some too intense attempt to unify them. To be sure, that is what scien- tists do, but unlike those whom we regard as mentally ill, scientists also manage to maintain their ordinary views. Once a child is deprived of the normal ways to divide those lsslrn5-ne matter what the cause of this-that hapless mind is doomed to fail. T H E N E A T M S O F T H O U G H T 297\n29.7 LIKENESSES AND ANATOGIES You are a full-spread, fair-set vine, #i;:;,i::,0,!::l:;',:,,'\",::,:Til:' - R o s s n r H E R R T c K We always try to use old memories to recollect how we solved problems in the past. But nothing's ever twice the same, so recollections rarely match. Then we must force our memories to fit-so we can see those different things as similar. To do this, we can either modify a memory or change how we represent the present scene. For example, suppose you need a hammer but can only find a stone. One way to turn that stone to you, p,rrpbres would be to make it fit your memory of a hammer's appearance-for example, by making your description of the stone include an imaginary boundary that divides it into two parts, to serve as handle and as head. Another way would be to make your hammer frame accept the entire stone as a hammer without a handle. Either scheme will make the memory match the description, but both will lead to conflicts in other agencies. How hard it will be to make such a match depends both on which agents are now active in your mind and on the levels of their priorities-in short, upon the context already established. It will be easy for you to see two things as similar when you only need to chang. ,\"lrtiu.ly weak attachments at the conceptual fringes of familiar things. But frequently the eaie of comprehen- sion will also depend upon how readily you can switch from one mental realm to another. Consider what mrrst happen in our minds when poets speak about their loves in romantic, floral terms. We all have learned a certain common way to represent a woman's beauty in terms of flowers that are prone, alas, to fade. For centuries this formula has been established in our language and literature; however, at first it must have seemed bizarre. We cannot possibly match our descriptions of women and flowers if we insist on interpreting such phrases and poems \"literally\"-that-is to say, \"illiterately\"-srlirely within the physical realm of the appear- ance, composition, and behavior of a typical flower. To be sure, the colors, symmetries, and smells of flowers can certainly arouse the sorts of states we associate with things we've come to see as beautiful. But the more essential trick is in knowing how to turn entirely away from the physical realm and dwell instead upon the images and fantasies that flowers evoke in other spheres-such as the sense of a thing so sweet and innocent, so helpless and delicate, that it invites affection, nurture, and protection. Features like these must be made to fit the listener's private love ideal-only then can the metaphor match. This, Herrick's bitter verse defeats. By holding us so tightly to the usual frames for human shapes, he steers us into fantasies of vegetables with hands and feet. 298 T H E R E A T M S O F T H O U G H T\n29.8 UTETAPHORS Listen closely to anything anyone says, and soon you'll hear analogies. We speak of time in terms of space, as likea fluid that's running out;we talk of our friends in physical terms, as in ,,Mary oni Tohn (fie very close.\" All of our language is riddled and stitched with curious ways of portraying things as though they belonged to alien realms. We sometimes call theie \"metaphors,\" our ways to transport thoughts between the Various mental realms. Some metaphor, ,L\"- utterly pedestrian, as when we speak of \"taking steps\" to cause or prevent some happening. Other metaphors seem more miraculous, when unexpected images lead to astonishing i\"sights-as when a scientist solves a problem by conceiving of a fluiJas made of tubes or of awave as an array of overlapping, expanding spheres. When such conceptions play important roles in our most productive forms of thought, we find it natural to ask, \"Wh at ii a metiphor?\" But we rarely notice how frequently we use the same techniques in ordinary thought. Whai, then, is a metaphor? It might be easy to agree on functional definitions like \"A metaphor is th.at which allows us to replace one kind of thought with another.\" But when we ask for a structural definition of \"metaphor,\" we find no unity, onlv an endless variety of processes and strategies. Some are simple, as when we make,an analogy by stripping away so many details that two different objects seem the same. But other forms of metaphor are as complex as can be. In the end there is little to gain by cloaking them all under the same name \"metaphor,\" because there isn't any boundary between metaphorical thought and ordinary thought' No two things or mental states ever are identical, so every psychological process must employ one means or another to induce the illusion of sameness. Every thought is to some degree a metaphor. Once scientists like Volta and Ampere discovered how to represent electricity in terms of the pressures and flows of fluids, they could transport much of what they already knew about fluids io the domain of electricity. Good metaphors are useful because they transport uniframes, intact, from one world into another. Such cross-realm correspondences can enable us to trans- port entire families of problems into other realms, in which we can apply to them some already well-developed skills. However, such correspondences are hard to find since most reformula- tions merely transform the uniframes of one realm into disorderly accumulations in the other realm. From where do we obtain our most productive, systematic, cross-realm correspondences? Some must be virtually born into our brains through the wiring of our paranomes; other metaphors we discover by ourselves as individuals; but most of them are learned from other *.*b\"rs of our cultural communities. Finally, from time to time, someone discovers a new reformulation that is both so fruitful and so easy to explain that it becomes part of the general culture. Naturally, we'd like to know how the greatest metaphorical discoveries were made. But because this is buried in the past, the best and rarest of those events ma.v never be explained at all. Our greatest ideas, like our evolutionaqi genes, need form only once, by accident, and then can spread from brain to brain.

Suppose Mary (or some other creature or machine) can answer certain questions about the world-without the need to do any actual experiments. Then we'd agree that Mary knows those things about the world. But what would it mean, to you or to me, to hear lack say that \"Mary knows geometry\"? For all we know, Mary might |elieve that circles are square, and it happens that fack agrees! |ack's statement tells us more about Iack than about Mary. When lack says, \"Mdry knows geometry,\" this indicates to us that lack would probably be satisfied by Mary's dnswers to the questions about geometry that he would be disPosed to ask. The meaning of \"Mary knows geometry\" depends on who is saying it. After all, no one knows everything about geometry; that statement would not mean the same to us as to a mathemati- cian, *hose conclpts of geometry are different from those of ordinary persons. In the same way, the meanings of *any other terms depend upon the-speaker's role. Even an apparently unambiguous statement like \"This is a painting of d horse\" shares this character: you can be sure of little more than that it displays a representation that in someone's view resembles a horse in some respects. Then ,\"hy, when we talk about knowledge, don't we have to say who all those speakers and observers aie? Because we make assumptions by default. When a stranger says that Mary knows geometry, w€ simply assume that the speaker would expect any typical person who knows Mary [o ,gr\". iitat she inows geometry. Assumptions like that allow us to communicate; unless there is some reason to think otherwise, we (tssume that all the things involved are\"typical.\" It does not bother us that a professional mathematician might not agree that Mary knows geometry- because a mathematician doesn't fit our stereotype of a \"typical person'\" you might maintain that none of this applies to you, since you know what you know about geometry. But there's still an observer on th. scene, only now it is hiding inside your mind- iam.ly, the portion of \"yor\" that claims you know geometry. But the part of you that makes this claim has little in common with the other parts that actu ally do geometry for your those agencies are probably incapable ,of speech and probably devoid of thoughts about your knowl- edge and beliefs. fraturally, we'd all prefer to think of knowledge as morg positive_ and less provisional or relative. But little gooi has ever come from trying to link what we believe to our ideals about absolute truths. W! always yearn for certainty,-bu[ the only thing beyond dispute is that there's ,i*\"vr room for doubt. And doubt is not an enemy that sets constraints on what we know; the real danger to mental growth is perfect faith, doubt's antidote' 301 M E N T A T M O D E T S\n30.2 KNOWING AND BETJEVING {9 9ft9n speak as though we classify our thoughts into different types called facts, opinions, and beliefs. \"The red obiect is on the table.\" \"l think the red block is on the table.\" \"l believe that the red block is on the table.\" How do these statements differ from one another? Some philosophers have argued that \"knowing\" must mean \"tnte and iustified betief.\" However, no one has ever found a test to p-rove what's lustified or true. For example, we all know that the sun rises in the morni rrt/rvr vvv qrr Arr\\-/vv LrrcrL Lll(t )|'-trl lISCS lll tlle mofnlng. 9::\"Jqil8,38o, some people thought t!i1 was- due to godlike agents in the sky, and that the the r ^ J , s r l L t L r r a L L I I S s,un's traiector{ was w}e1e Apollo s[ee.ed his chariot. t'oJrf ou, scientists tell us that the sun r r u J L r r d . t L r t L ) L l l I *:::ll ::Ill^tjtlil lt: TT\":,\" \"sunrise\" is simply what *\" .r\"h experience when the planet ;;;';'';;ll\"d#ffi5ihil; l h o * i o - t + + - , , ^ that isn't true. To comprehend what knowing is, we have to guard ourselves against that single-agent fallacy of thinking that the \"r\" in \"/ beliive\" is actually a single, stable thirig. The truih is that a person,s mind holds different views in different realms. Th\"us, one part of an astronomer's mind can apply the common view of sunrise to down-to-earth affairsl regarding the sun as like a lamp that wakes us up and lights our way. But at the same time, that same astronomer can apply the modern physical view to technical problems in astronomy. We each use many different views, and which we choose to use depends, from one moment to the next, upon the changing balance of power among ort ng\"nii.r. Then if what we \"believe\" is so conditional, what makes us feel that our beliefs are much more definite than that? It is because whenever we commit ourselves to speakor act, we thereby have to force ourselves into clear-cut, action-oriented states of mind in which ,most of our questions are suppressed' As far as everyday life is concerned, decisiveness is indispensable; otherwise we'd have to act so cautiousty ihai nothing *o,rld get done. And here lies much of what we express with words like \"guess,\" \"belieue,; and \"know.\" In the course of making practical decisions (and thereby turning off most agencies), we use such words to summ arize our various varieties of certainty. The notion that only certain of a person's beliefs are \"genuine\" plays vital roles in all our moral and legal schemes. Whenever we censure or applarriwhat \"th;r;;ofi. ao, we,re taught to be more concerned with what those other p.opi\" \"genuinely\" expected or intended to happen than with what actuallv happened. This dbctiine tinderlies ho* we distinguish thought- lessness and forgetfulness from lies, dec.it, and treacherv. I do not mean that such distinctions are not important, only that they do not iustify the simplistic _assumption that, among all the mind's activities, certain special kinds of thorrghts are essentially -or'\" 'I.rruirr\",, than others. All such distinctions seem less absolute when every deeper probe into beliefs reveals more ambiguities. 302 M E N T A T M O D E T S\n30.3 MENTAT MODETS Does a book know what is written inside it? Clearly, no. Does a book contain knowledge? Clearly, yes. But how could anything contain knowledge, yet not know it? We've seen how saying that a person or machine possesses knowledge amounts to saying that som e observer cotuld employ that person or machine to answer certain kinds of questions. Here is another view of what it means to know. \"lack knows about A\" medns that there is a \"model\" M of A inside lack's head. But what does it mean to say that one thing is a model of another and how could one have a model in one's head? Again, we have to specify some standard or authority. Let's make fack be the judge of that: lack considers M to be a good model of A to the extent that he finds M useful for answering questions about A. For example, suppose that A is a real automobile, and M is the kind of obiect we call a \"toy\" or \"model\" car. Ttren fack will be able to use M to answer certain questions about A. However, we would think it strange to say that M is fack's \"knowledge\" about A-because we reserve the word \"knowledge\" for something inside a head, and fack can't keep a toy inside his head. But we never said that a model -nr[ be an ordinary physical object. Our definition allows a model to be anything that helps a person answer questions. Accordingly, a person could possess a \"mental model,\" too-in thelorm of some machinery or subsociety of agents inside the brain. This provides us with a simple explanation of what we mean by knowledge: lack's knowledge aboui A is simpty whicheveimentol models, processes, or agencies lack's other agencies cdn use to answer questions about A. Thus, a person's mental model of a car need not itself resemble an actual car in any obvious way. It need not itself be heavy, fast, or consume gasoline to be able to answer q,r\"riiorrs about a car like \"How heovy is it?\" or \"How fast can it go?\" Our mental models also work in social realms to answer questions like \"Who owns that car?\" or \"Who permitted you to park it there?\" However, to understand questions like these, we have to ask what people mean by \"who\"-snd the answer is that we make mental models of people, too. In ordei foi Mary to \"know\" about fack's dispositions, motives, and possessions, Mary has to build inside her head some structure to help answer those kinds of questions-and that structure will constitute her mental model of fack. |ust think of all the different things our person-models do for us! If Mary knows /ack well enough, she'll be able to reply not only to physical questions like \"How tall is lack?\" but also to social inquiries such as_\"Does he like me?\" and euenio psychological queries like \"Wh at are lack's ideols?\" Quite possibly, Mary's model of Jack will be aUie to piod.t\"e more accurate answers to such questions than fack himself could prod,r\"e. People's mental models of their friends are often better, in certain respects, than their mental models of themselves. We all make models of ourselves and use them to predict which sorts of things we'll later be disposed to do. Naturally, our models of ourselves will often provide us with wrong answers because they are not fauitless ways to see ourselves, but merely self-made answering machines. M E N T A T M O D E T S 303\n30.4 WORTD MODETS Now let's look at Mary's model of the world. (By \"world\" I planet Earth.) This is simply all the structures in Mary's head answer questions about things in the world. mean the universe, not iust the that Mary's agencies can use to Mary's brain Mary's model of the world But what if we were to ask Mary a question not about any particular object, but one like \"What sort of thing is the world itself?\" That would put Mary in a curious predicament. She cannot answer this by using her world model, because each part of that model is desigrr.J only to answer ques.tions about particular things. The trouble is ihat the world itself is nol a fartic- ular thing inside the world. One way to deal with this (and a method that, surely, many children use) is adding to the model of the world an additional \"obiec1\"-that ,\"pr.i\".,ts the world itself. Then, since any obiect must have properties, the child might then ,rrign to this the features, say, of an extremely large ball. Naturally this will lead to trouble should [h\"t \"hild persist in arking ordinary ques- tions about this extra.ordinary obiect-such as \"What keeps thi universe ii place?\" or,,What,s outside the univsTss?\"-fsr these then lead to strange and inconsistent images. Eventually we learn some ways to deal with this-for example, byiearrring which questions to suppress. But as in the case of a perfect point, we may always feei uncomflrtable with the thought of a thing tha_t is unimaginably large in size, but has no ,hrp\" at all. When you get right down to it, you can never ieally describe any worldty thing, either-that is, in any absolute sense. Whatever you purport to iay about a tiring, you're only expressing your own beliefs. Yet even that gloomy thought r,rgg\"rt, \"n insight. E;;r if our models of the world cannot yield good answers about the worlJir r whole, \"and .u\"r, iho,rgr, their other answers are frequently Ylong, they can tell us something about ourselves. We can regard what we learn about our models of the world as constituting iu, models of our models of the world.. 's model of hersetf Mary's brain Mary's model of the world model of her of the world Mary's model 304 M E N T A T M O D E T S\n30.5 KNOWING OURSELVES Now let's ask Mary to describe herself-to tell us everything she can about her shape and weight and size and strength, her dispositions and her traits, her accomplishments and ambi- tions, wishes, fears, possessions, and so on. What might be the general character of what we'd hear? At first it would be hard to assemble any coherent sense of all those details. But gradually we'd notice that various groups of items were closely related, while others were rarely men- tioned in connection with one another. Little by little, we would discern structure and organi- zation in what Mary had said, and finally we'd start to see the outlines of at least two different mental realms. Physlcal Realm Mental Realm Now, what would happen if we asked Mary to speak not about specific things, but about the general subject of \"What kind of entity am l?\" Since she has no direct way to examine her entire self, she can only summarize what she can discover about her mental model of herself. In doing so, she'll probably find that almost everything she knows appears to lie in two domains, with relatively little in between. This means that Mary's model of her model of herself will have crn oyerdtl dumbbell shape, one side of which represents her physical self, the other side of which represents her psychological self. Do people go on to make models of their models of their models of themselves? If we kept on doing things like that, we'd get trapped in an infinite regress. What saves us is that we get confused and lose track of the distinctions between each model and the next-just as our language-agencies lose track when they hear about \"the rat that the cat that the dog worried kitted.\" Th\" same thing must happen whenever we ask ourselves questions like \"Did lohn know that I knew thot he knew that I knew that he knew that?\" And the same thing happens whenever we try to probe into our own motivations by continually repeating, \"What was my motive for wanting that?\" Eventually, we simply stop and say,\"BecduEel simply wanted fo.\" The same when we find things hard to decide: we can simply say, \"f iust decide,\" and this can help us interrupt what otherwise might be an endless chain of reasoning. M E N T A L M O D E T S 305\n30.6 FREEDOM OF WII.I We each believe that we possess an Ego, Self, or Final Center of Control, from which we choose what we shall do at every fork in the road of time. To be sure, we sometimes have the sense of being dragged along despite ourselves, by internal processes which, though they come from within our minds, nevertheless seem to work against our wishes. But on the whole we still feel that we can choose what we shall do. Whence comes this sense of being in control? According to the modern scientific view, there is simply no room at all for \"freedom of the human will. \" Everything that happens in our universe is either completely determined by what's already happened in the past or else depends, in part, on random chance. Everything, including that which happens in our brains, depends on these and only on these: A set of fixed, deterministic laws. A purely random set of accidents. There is no room on either side for any third alternative. Whatever actions we may \"choose,\" they cannot make the slightest change in what might otherwise have been-becduse those rigid, natural laws already caused the states of mind that caused us to decide that way. And if that choice was in part made by chance-it still leaves nothing for us to decide. Every action we perform stems from a host of processes inside our minds. We sometimes understand a few of them, but most lie far beyond our ken. But none of us enjoys the thought that what we do depends on processes we do not know; we prefer to attribute our choices to volition, will, or self-control. We like to give names to what we do not know, and instead of wondering how we work, we simply talk of being \"free.\" Perhaps it would be more honest to say, \"My decision was determined by internal forces I do not understand.\" But no one likes to feel controlled by something else. Why don't we like to feel compelled? Because we're largely made of systems designed to learn to achieve their goals. But in order to achieve any long-range goals, effective difference-engines must also learn to resist whatever other processes attempt to make them change those goals. In childhood, everyone learns to recognize, dislike, and resist various forms of aggression and compulsion. Naturally we're horrified to hear about agents that hide in our minds and influence what we decide. In any case, both alternatives are unacceptable to self-respecting minds. No one wants to submit to laws that come to us like the whims of tyrants who are too remote for any possible appeal. And it's equally tormenting to feel that we're a toy to mindless chance, caprice, or probability-for though these leave our fate unfixed, we'd still not play the slightest part in choosing what shall come to be. So, though it's futile to resist, we continue to regard both Cause and Chance as intrusions on our freedom of choice. There remains only one thing to do: we add another region to our model of our mind. We imagine a third alternative, one easier to tolerate; we imagine a thing called \"freedom of will,\" which lies beyond both kinds of constraint. 306 M E N T A I M O D E T S\n30.7 THE MYTH OF THE THIRD AITERNATTVE To save our belief in the freedom of will from the fateful grasps of Cause and Chance, people simply postulate an empty, third alternative. We imagine that somewhere in each person's mind, there lies a Spirit, Will, or Soul, so well concealed that it can elude the reach of any law -or lawless accident. I've drawn the box for Will so small because we're always taking things out of it-and scarcely ever putting things in! This is because whenever we find some scrap of order in the world, we have to attribute it to Cause-and whenever things seem to obey no laws at all, rn'e attribute that to Chance. This means that the dominion controlled by Will can only hold what, up to now, we don't yet understand. In ancient times, that realm was huge, when every planet had its god, and every storm or animal did manifest some spirit's wish. But now for many centuries., we've had to watch that empire shrink. Does this mean that we must embrace the modern scientific view and put aside the ancient myth of voluntary choice? No. We can't do that: too much of what we think and do revolves around those old beliefs. Consider how our social lives depend upon the notion of responsibility and how little that idea would mean without our belief that personal actions are voluntary. Without that belief, no praise or shame could accrue to actions that were caused by Cause, nor could we assign any credit or blame to deeds that came about by Chance. What could rve make our children learn if neither they nor we perceived some fault or virtue anywhere? We also use the idea of freedom of will to justify our judgments about good and evil. A person can entertain a selfish impulse, yet turn it aside because it seems wrong, and that must happen when some self-ideal has intervened to overrule another goal. We can feel virtuous when we think that we ourselves have chosen to resist an evil temptation. But if we suspected that such choices were not made freely, but by the interference of some hidden agency, we might very well resent that interference. Then we might become impelled to try to wreck the precious value-schemes that underlie our personalities or become depressed about the futility of a predestination tempered only by uncertainty. Such thoughts must be suppressed. No matter that the physical world provides no room for freedom of will: that concept is essential to our rnodels of the mental realm. Too much of our psychology is based on it for us to ever give it up. We're virtually forced to maintain that belief, even though we know it's false -except, of course, when we're inspired to find the flaws in all our beliefs, whatever may be the consequence to cheerfulness and mental peace. M E N T A T M O D E L S\n30.8 INTETIJGENCE AND RESOURCEFT'LNESS How could anything as complex as a human mind work so well for so many years? We all appreciate those splendid feats of writing plays and symphonies. But we rarely recognize how wonderful it is that a person can traverse an entire lifetime without making a single really serious mistake-like putting a fork in one's eye or using a window instead of a door- How do we do such amazing feats as to imagine things we've never seen before, to overcome obstacles, to repair things that are broken, to speak to one another, to have new ideas? What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle. Our species has evolved many effective although imperfect methods, and each of us individually develops more on our own. Even- tually, very few of our actions and decisions come to depend on any single mechanism. Instead, they emerge from conflicts and negotiations among societies of processes that constantly chal- lenge one another. In this book we've seen many such dimensions of diversity: The accumulation of myriad subagents. We learn mdny different ways to achieve each kind of goal. The many realms of ordinary thought. When one viewpoint fails to solve a problem, we cdn adopt other perspectives. The endowment of several \"instinctive\" protominds. We embody different kinds of organizations for achieving mdny kinds of goals. The hierarchies of administration grown in accord with Papert's principle. When simple methods fail, we can build new leyels of organization. The evolutionary vestiges of animals that still remain inside our brains. We use machinery evolved from fish, amphibia, reptiles, and earlier mammals. The sequence of stages of the growing child's personality. We accumulate different personalities that we cdn affly to different situations. The complex, ever-growing heritage of language and culture. We can use methods and ideas developed by millions of our ancestors. The subordination of thought processes to censors and suppressors. We do not need perfect methods, since we cdn remembe, hoi imperfect methods fail. Each of these dimensions gives you toughness and versatility. They offer alternative ways to proceed when any system fails. If part of your society of mind proposes to do what other parts find unacceptable, your agencies can usually find another way. Sometimes you merely n..d to turn to another branch of the same accumulation. When that fails, you can ascend to a higher level and engage alarger change in strategy. Then, even if an entire agency should fail, four brain retains earlier versions of it. This means that every facet of your personality may have the option to \"regress\" to an earlier stage, which already has proved itself competent to deal with the usual problems of life. Finally, when even that won't work, you can usually switch to an entirely different family of agencies. Whenever anything goes wrong, there are always other realms of thought. 308 M E N T A T M O D E T S\nAPPENDIX I HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT Sometimes we ask why people are so similar. At other times, we wonder why they differ so much from one to the next. Often we try to classify our differences into those with which we're born and those we later learn-and then we find ourselves arguing about which virtues are inherited, and which we acquire from experience. Most arguments about \"nature vs. nurture\" are based on two mistakes. One is to talk about intelligence as though a person's quality of mind were like a quantity one could pour into a cup. The other mistake is to assume that there is a clear distinction between what we learn and how we learn-as though experience had no effect on how we learn. Chance plays a major role in human differences, because each of us starts out by drawing lots from among our parents' genes. A gene is a unit of heredity-a specific chemical whose structure affects some aspects of the construction of the body and the brain. We inherit each of our genes from one parent or the other, more or less by chance, so as to receive about half of each parent's genes. Within the population as a whole, each particular kind of gene has variants that work in somewhat different ways, and there are so many possible combinations of these alternative genes that every child is born unique-except in the case of identical twins, who carry identical copies of genes. One thing that makes people both so different and so similar is this: we dre similar because those alternative genes dre usudlly quite similar-and we are different because those genes are not identical. Every cell of the body contains identical copies of all of that person's genes. But not all genes are active at the same time-and this is why the cells in our different organs do different things. When a particular gene is \"turned on\" inside a cell, that cell manufactures copies of a particular chemical (called a protein), whose structure is determined by the structure of that gene. Pro- teins are used in many ways. Some of them are assembled into permanent structures, some are involved in manufacturing other chemicals, and certain proteins move around in the cell, to serve as messages that alter other processes. Since certain combinations of these messages can turn other genes on and off, the gene-constructed chemicals in cells can act like small societies of agencies. Every cell has windows in its walls and special genes that control which chemicals can enter or leave through those windows. Then, certain of those chemicals can act as messages that change the states of specific genes in other cells. Thus groups of cells can also be societies. The effects of most of those messages between cells are temporary and reversible, but some of them can permanently change the character of other cells by altering the types of messages they can transmit and receive. In effect, this converts them into other \"types\" of cells. When new types of cells are produced this way, certain of them remain in place, but other types proceed to\nmove and reproduce-to form new layers, strands, or clumps. Inside the brain, certain types of cells emit specific chemicals that drift out like scents; this causes certain other types of mobile cells that are sensitive to those particular chemicals to sniff out those scents and track them back to their sources-leaving tubelike trails behind. These traces of the travels of those mi- gratory cells then form the nerve-bundles that interconnect various pairs of far-apart brain- agencies. With all this activity, the embryonic brain resembles a complex animal ecology- which even includes predators programmed to find and kill the many cells that happen to reach \"wrong\" destinations. All human brains are similar in size and shape but differ in many smaller respects because of different alternative genes. Why does the human population support so many variant genes? One reason is that genes are sometimes altered by accidents. When this happens to a gene that lies within a reproductive cell-that is, inside an ovum or a sperm-the change will be inher- ited. We call this a \"mutation.\" Most often, a mutant gene will simply fail to manufacture some vital chemical, and this will so badly impair the offspring that natural selection will quickly remove the mutated gene from the population. But occasionally a mutant gene will endow those offspring with some substantial advantage. Then natural selection will spread copies of that gene so widely among the population that its predecessor gene becomes extinct. Finally, a variant gene may provide an advantage only in certain circumstances; this type of muta- tion may spread only to a certain proportion of the population, and both the new and the old variants will continue to coexist indefinitely. The richness of this reservoir of alternative genes can determine how quickly a population adapts to changes in ecological conditions- and thus determines whether the entire species can escape extinction over longer periods of time. Now let's return to what genes do. Not all genes turn on at once; some start early and some start late. In general, the sooner a gene starts working, the greater its effect on what comes afterward. Accordingly, it is the early-starting genes that most affect the basic, large-scale architecture of our bodies and our brains. A mutation in an early-working gene is likely to cause such a drastic alteration of an animal's basic architecture that the embryo will not survive to be born, grow up, and reproduce successfully. Accordingly, most mutations of early-working genes are swiftly weeded out of the population by natural selection. Mutations in later-starting genes tend to cause less drastic differences, hence are not so swiftly weeded out and can accumulate in the population-for example, as variations in the genes that affect the sizes of connections between various brain-agencies. Every different combination of such variant genes produces a person with a somewhat different brain. The early-starting genes thus frame the large-scale outlines of the brain-and their unifor- mity explains why people are so similar on the broadest scale. These must be the genes respon- sible for what we call \"human n2fsps\"-that is, the predispositions every normal person shares. Generally, the uniformity of early-starting genes is what makes all the members of each animal species seem so similar; indeed, it is partly why the earth is populated with distinct, recognizable species like lions, turtles, and people, rather than with an indistinct continuum of all conceiv- able animals. No human mother ever bears a cat, since that would require too many different early-starting genes. 2 THE GENESIS OF MENTAT REATMS All normal children come to recognize the same sorts of physical objects. Is that because the concept of an object is innate in the human mind? Each of us becomes attached to certain other individuals. Does this mean that the concept of person, and the notion of love, are part of our inheritance? Every human child forms \"realms of thought\" that represent the physical, possessional, and psychological. But how could genes build concepts into minds when genes themselves are merely linked-together chemicals? The problem is that thoughts proceed on levels so far removed from those of chemicals. This 3 1 0 A P P E N D I X\nmakes it hard for genes, which are merely chemicals, to represent such things as objects, persons, or ideas-at least in anything like the way that strings of words express our thoughts. Then how do genes encode ideas? The answer lies in the concept of \"predestined learning\" discussed in section 11.7. Although groups of genes cannot directly encode specific ideas, they can determine the architecture of agencies that are destined to learn particular kinds of pro- cesses. To illustrate this principle, we'll outline the architecture of an agency destined to learn to recognize a human individual. When we first introduced the concept of a recognizer, we suggested a simple way to represent a physical object in terms of properties like color, texture, size, and shape-by combining evidence from several agencies, each containing sensors especially designed to react to certain particular properties. Now we'll take another step, by dividing each of those agencies into two sections that are similar in architecture, and which both receive sensory inputs from the eyes, ears, skin, and nose. The first system is destined, as before, to learn to represent physical objects in terms of simple properties. However, because the second system's inputs come from different types of agents, it is destined to learn to represent \"social objects\"-that is, people. Our second \"social object\" agency takes all of its inputs from sensors that detect stimuli which usually signify the presence of a person-namely, human odors, voices, and faces. Because of this-and even though the genes that assemble this system know nothing of people -this system has no alternative but to learn to represent relations among the features of human individuals. Accordingly, this agency is destined to learn to recognize people! The large-scale outline of this agency poses no engineering mystery-but we have to ask how genes could produce the sensory detectors that the system needs to do its iob. There is ample evidence that the recognition of both voices and faces does indeed take place in special sections of the brain-since certain injuries of the brain leave their victims unable to distinguish voice sounds yet still able to recognize many other kinds of sounds, while other brain iniuries destroy the ability to reco gnize faces but leave other visual functions intact. No one yet knows iust how these recognition-systems work, but let's consider each in turn. oDoR RECOGNTTIoN: lt is easy to build recognizers for particular odors because an odor is merely the presence of a certain combination of chemicals in the air, and a specific gene can make a cell sensitive to a particular chemicaL So, to build agents for recognizing the odors of particular obiects or people requires little more than connecting d variety of evidence-weighing agents fo a variety of specific chemical detectors. A P P E N D I X 3 l l\nvoICE RECOGNITIoN: To distinguish the sounds of a human voice requires more machinery because vocal expressions dre complicated sequences of events. Machines haye been built that can make such distinctions. FACE RECOGNITION: No one has yet been able to build vision machines that ap- proach our human ability to distinguish faces from other obiects-or eyen to disti'n- guish dogs from cats. This remains a problem for research. In their first few days, human infants learn to distinguish people by their odors; then, over the next few weeks, they learn to recognize individuati bv sound of voice; only after several months do they start to reliably distinguish the sights of iaces. Most likely we learn to make each of these distinctions by several different methods, and it is probably noaccident that these abilities develop in a sequence that corresponds to their increasing complexity. 3 GESTURES AND TR..A.JECTORIES To recognize a voice or face seems hard enough; how does a child learn to recognize another person's mental state-of being angry or affectionate, for exam ple. One way is Ul, aistinguish- ing traiectories- fust as we learn to interpret certain types of changes as representing the -6tior* of obiects in the physical realm, we learn to classify oth\"r types Jf .nrngls as signifying mental events; these are what we call \"gestures\" and \"expressions.'\"-For exampTe, to identify icertain sound to be a particular language-word, some agencies inside your brain must recognize that a certain sequence of phonetic features has occurred. At the same time, other \"g..r\"i., interpret sequences of vocal sounds as having significance in other realms. In particular, certain types of vocal sounds are recognized as signifying specific emotional qualiiies. For example, people almost universally agree on which expreisions seem most angry or imperative. In general, abruptly changing sounds evoke alarm-perhaps by inducing the sort of narro*ing of interest that comes with pain; in any case, sudden changes in volume and pitch demand that we attend to them. In contrast, we react to \"gentle\" soun?s in ways that people label \"positive,\" ,s with affection, love, or reverence; the smoother time-traieciories do somehow serve to ,.calm us down,\" thus frequently inducing us to set aside our other interests. It's quite the same fo, ,ight and touch; hostile persons tend to iab and shout, while friendly people speak and wave with gestures and trajectories that we perceive as signifiring gentleness and tenderness. Indeed, as shown in Manfred Clynes's book, Sentics, OoJUteary\", T.{\"* york, Ig7g, people show similar emotional responses to certain types of time-trajectories regardless of the sensory domain. We consistently identify certain sudden,-ierky typgs of action pftt.rn, as indicating anger-regard- less of whether these are presented'as visual motions, \", \"r,u.lopes of voice sounds, or as pushing, shoving tactile stimuli. In the same way, we consistently identify certain other, smoother action patterns to indicate affection. Clynes concludes that at least half a dozen distinct types of traiectories are universally associa[ed with particular emotional states. What sort of brain-machinery could cause us to react in such simiiar ways to such different kinds of stimuli? I propose a three-part hypothesis. First, each of our sensory-agencies is equipped with special agents that detect certain types of time-trajectories. Second, the outputs of aU it . ,g\".rt, that detect similar \"trajectory typei\" in different agencies are connected, through special con- nection bundle-s, to converge upon agents in some central \"gesture- rec:,ogniti;g\" ;g*\"v. e'i- nally, genetically established nerve-bundles run from each gesture-recognizing agent to a particular infantile \"proto-specialist\" of the sort described in sectio n 16.3. According to this hypothesis,- each sensory-agency contains agents that are specialized to react to various types of temporal trajectories. For example, one ki;d might react orrty to stimuli that increase slowly and then decrease quickly; another kind might relct only to signals that increase quickly and decay slowly. Inside the brain, although th; agencies foi f,.ari-rg, sight, and touch lie far apart, the signals from agents that detect\"similar irajectories converge on a 3t2 A P P E N D I X\n(Humans detect some sLow, sltooTH sLow, SM OOT H (No odor trajectories detected by humans?) TRAJECTORY.TYPE CLASSIFIERS Y GESTURE.TYPE RECOGNIZERS common agency composed of evidence-weighing agents. Notice that the architecture of this system is so similar to that of our \"person-recognizing\" agency that the two systems could form parallel layers; however, the destiny of each central \"traiectory-type\" agent is to learn to recog- nize, not a particular person, but a particular type of gesture or expression. For example, one such agent might learn to react in similar ways to a snarl, grimace, or shaken fist-and thus become an \"anger-recognizing\" agent whose function is \"abstract\" in the sense of being de- tached from any particular class of sensations. To be sure, recognizing anger is not the same as comprehending or sympathizing with anger -nor does merely learning to make such a recognition, by itself, teach us to identify an \"anger- type\" trajectory of another person with our own personal experience of being angry. But if our genes equip us with connections from particular central trajectory-type agents to specific \"proto-specialist\" agencies, then each particular trajectory-type recognition would tend to acti- vate a specific kind of emotional reaction. Some of these connections could endow us with certain \"empathigs\"-f61 example, to feel elated upon recognizing another person's joyous gestures. Other connections could make us become defensive at signs of aggression-or even aggressive at signs of weakness and with- drawal. There are innumerable examples, in animal behavior, of particular types of gestures evoking \"instinctive\" types of reactions, as when a sudden motion toward a bird provokes a feat' reaction flight. Surely our human genes provide us with a great deal of instinctive wiring. However, far more than any other kind of animal, we also have machinery that can bridge new agencies across the older ones, so that we can learn to bury ancient instincts under modern social disciplines. We've seen how a gene-built agency could predispose us to use traiectory types to represent emotional and other sorts of states of mind. Once this is done, higher-level agencies could use the signals from trajectory-type agents to learn to recognize and represent more complex successions of mental states. In time, those representations could be assembled into models we could use for predicting and controlling our own mental processes. This illustrates how archi- tectures framed by genes could serve our minds as stepping-stones toward learning how to think about ourselves. As soon as you enter a certain room, you may experience the feeling that you can directly sense its history. Many people attribute such perceptions to imaginary influences with names like \"intuitions,\" \"spirits,\" \"atmospheres,\" and \"vibrations.\" Yet very likely all such perceptions come from inside the mind of those observers, as various mental agencies accomplish clever FAST, 3 1 3 FAST, ,.,-:':'t*t SLOW, FAST, A P P E N D I X\nsyntheses from clues derived from features and traiectories. In my view, believing in vibrations and ghosts diminishes our capabilities for mental growth by diveiting attention fiom the mind and attributing those abilities to imaginary entities outside ourselves.- 4 BRAIN CONNECTIONS What possible sort of brain-machine could support a billion-agent society of mind? The human brain contains so many agencies and connections that it iesembles a great nation of cities and towns, linked by vast networks of roads and highways. We are born with brain centers that are specialized for every sense and muscle group, for moving every eye and limb; for distinguishing the sounds of words, the features of faces, and all sorts of touches, tastes and smells. We're born with protospecialists involved with hunger, laughter , fear and anger, sleep, and sexual activity-and surely many other functionr ro ott. has tiscovered yet-e\"ach based upon a somewhat different architecture and mode of operation. Thousands of different genes must be involved in laying out these agencies and the nerve-bundles between them-and lhose brain-growth genes must generate at least three kinds of processes. Those genetic systems first must form the clumps and layers of brain cells that eventually become g.o,tpr of agents; they must dictate the inner workings of those agencies; and, finally, thev -,tit determine the sizes and destinations of the nerve-bundles that interconnect those agencies-in order to constrain \"who talks to whom\" within each mind-society. Now every population will include some variants among the genes that shape those highways in the brain, and this must influence their bearers' potential styles of thougirt. e p\"rro\"n born with u_nusually sparse connections between the agencies for sight and spe\"ech might develop powerful machinery in both those realms but find it hard to make direct fonnections between them' On the surface, that might seem to constitute a disability. However, it might also lead to an advantage-if it served to force one's higher-level agencies to seek out indir.it \"onrrections that lead to more articulate ways to represent reality. Similarly, one might suppose there would be advantages in havin g an uncommonly large capacity for sirort-terrn-me*-ory. Yet for all we know, our evolution has disfavored that because it tends to lead to less effective use of hard- learned long-term memories. Other differences in how we think could stem from variations in connection paths. An individual whose K-lines had more branches than usual might become inclined to assemble larger-than-usual accumulations in cases where a person whoie memory- agents had fewer branches might be more disposed toward building u1ifr\"-.s. But the same genetic disposition can lead to different styles of thought: one p\".ronl\"ho is genetically disposed toward making uniframes might succumb to the chronic use of superficiai stereotypes, while artother person similarly endowed might compensate by building -or\" deeplv 6y.r.i agencies that lead to more profound ideas. Although each particular variation will dispose each i.,aiuia- ual toward certain traits of personality, the final effect of any gene depends upon how it interacts with the structures built by other genes-and upon countless other accidents. This makes it almost meaningless to ask which particular genes lead to \"good\" forms of thought. It is better to think of a developing brain as a forest within which -rn\"y different creatures grow, in conflict and in harmony. Let's return to the architecture of machines that could hold societies of mind. How compli- cated this must be depends in part upon how many agents must be active at each moment. W\" can clarify the problem by considering two extre-.r. If only a few agents need to work at any time, then even an ordinary, serial, one-step-at-a-time computer could support billions of such agents-because each agent could be represented by a separate computer program. Then the computer itself could be quite simple, provided it has access to enough memory to hold all those little programs. On the other hand, no such arrangement would suffice to simulate societies of mind in which each of billions of agents constantly interact with all the others, all at once, because that would need more wires than any animal could carry in its head. I suspect that the human brain works somewhere in between; we do indeed have billions of nerve cells 314 A P P E N D I X\nworking at the same time, but relatively few of them have any need to communicate with more than a small proportion of the rest; this is simply because most agents are too specialized to deal with many types of messages. Accordingly, we'll propose an architecture that lies between those serial and parallel extremes-namely, a compromise in which a typical agent has comparatively few direct connections to other agents but can still influence a great many other agents through several indirect steps. For example, we can imagine a society in which each of a billion agents is connected to thirty other agents, selected at random. Then most pairs of agents should be able to communicate through merely half a dozen intermediates! This is because a typical agent can reach thirty others in one step, a thousand others in two steps, and a million others in only four steps. Thus a typical agent could reach any of the other billion agents in only six or seven steps! However, randomly selected connections would not be very useful, because very few ran- domly selected pairs of agents would have any messages that might be useful to one another. When we actually examine the human brain, we find that connections between cells are not made either uniformly or randomly. Instead, within any typical small region, we see a great many direct connections between nearby cells but only a relatively small number of bundles of connections to other regions of cells that lie farther away. Here is an idealized representation of this arrangement: Here,8 agents make a liftle atbe, and I such cubes make a 64-agent supercube. lf we join 8 of these supercubes, we'llhave 512 agents. And if we repeat this cube-on-cube pattern ten times, the resulting supercube willcontain a billion agents! But if we link each agent to 30 others instead of only 6, then each aaent could communicate with a bittion others in only 6 sfeps. An embryonic brain might assemble such a structure by repeating a sequence of cell divisions and migrations perhaps half a dozen times. If only that were done, the resulting structure would be uselessly repetitive. However, in a real brain's growth, this underlying building plan is modified at every step by many other processes, and this produces many agencies that are similar in general form but different in specific details. Some of these gene-controlled interven- tions modify the properties of specific layers and clumps of cells, and this determines the internal workings of particular agencies. Other interventions affect the sizes and destinations of the nerve-bundles that interconnect particular pairs of agencies. Such highway-routing processes could be used, for example, to lead the nerves that emerge from the trajectory-type sensors in different agencies to the same central destination. This would be quite easy to arrange because the trajectory agents of similar types would tend to have similar genetic origins -and that would predispose them to be able to \"smell\" the same varieties of embryonic message chemicals and thus grow toward the same destination. The same genetic argument can be applied to other aspects of a child's development-for 3 t 5 64 WTRES A P P E N D I X\nexamPle, to why all children seem to grow such similar Societies-of-More. When we discussed fean Piaget's experiments, we lelt it as a mystery how children form the agencies calle d History and Appeardnce. What leads all those different minds to similar conceptions of comparisons? In section 10.7 we hinted that this might happen because similar agents likeTatI ^ndThinorigi- nate in related sections of the brain. Consider that despite the Tact that we do not know the brain-machinery for agents like TaII and Thin, we can be virtually sure that they are similar internally, because they both respond to the same sorts of spatial diffetences. Therefore, they almost surely have a common evolutionary origin and are constructed by the same or similar genes. Consequently, the embryonic brain cells that form these agents wiil tend to have similar \"senses of smell\" and are therefore likely to send out nerves thaiconverge upon the same (or similar) agencies. From this point of view, the formation of a Spatial \"t\"n\"y on which such properties converge need not be an unlikely chance event, but could be virtually predestined by inheritance. - Papert's principle requires many agencies to grow by inserting new layers of agents into older, already working systems. But this poses a problem becaur., orr\". brain cells reach maturity, they no longer have much mobility. Consequently, adding new layers to old agencies must involve using brain cells in other locations. As far as we know, the only way this cluld be done is by using connections already available in the neighborhood of the orijinal agency. Here's one way embryonic cells could provide frameworks for future multilayered mind-iocieiies' Agents that lle clos to one another form clumps wlth many dlrect ennectlons. Lonoer connectlone betvyeen nearby clumps form - the foundatlon for hlgher-level as6ncles. Thts Ip repeated on several lncreaslnlly larger scales. A.y agency that is potentially capable of expanding to assimilate a lifetime of experience would need more space than any clump or layer of cells could provide in any \"o*p\"\"t neigh- borhood. This must be why the cerebral cortex-the newest rnd htg.st portion of fhe brairi- evolved its convoluted form. As our ancestors evolved, certain genes appeared, to cause certain agenciis to 2ylg\" and told-..and bulge-apd lold. again. These became the parts of the brain we call \"convolutlons\" because of thelr appearance. They form early ln life and mav constrain how larqe each division of ihe mind Is likely to-grow. If the connections in the cortex of the brain develop this way, through sequences of cell migrations, it could provide each local neighborhood with potential access to several other areas, through fanlike bundles and arrays of nerves. I have the impression the human cortex becomes thus folded upon itself perhaps five or six times, so that agents in each neighborhood have potential access to several other levels of convolution. This makes it possible for a typical agent to become connected to millions of other agents through only a few indirect connections. Presumably, only a small minority of cells ever actually acquire many such connections for their own exclusive use; however, such an arrangement makes any particular group of cells potentially capable of acquiring more significance-for example, by gaining control of a sub- stantial bundle of connections that comes to represent some useful microneme. In its evolu- tionary course of making available so many potential connections, the human brain has 6 € D 6 \\ € 0 6 3 1 6 A P P E N D I X\nactually gone so far that the major portion of its substance is no longer in its agencies but constitutes the enormous bundles of nerve fibers that potentially connect those agencies. The brain of Homo sapiens is mainly composed of cabling. 5 SURVWAT INSTINCT Many people seem to think that living things are born endowed with built-in instincts to survive. And certainly all animals do many things to stay alive. They build defenses against threats; they reproduce at any cost; they shy away from extremes of cold or heat, and from unfamiliarity. Now it usually is sensible, when one sees similarities, to seek some common cause for them. But I'll argue that it's usually wrong to seek a common force. There are many different reasons why animals do many things that help keep them alive-and, as we'll see, there is even a reason why there are so many different reasons. But to attribute this to any single, central force or to some basic, underlying survival instinct is as foolish as believing in special powers that attract corpses to cemeteries or broken cars to scrapyards. No animal requires any central reason to survive, nor does the process of evolution itself require any reason to produce all those survival aids. On the contrary, evolution's versatility stems from its very lack of any fixed direction or constraint that might restrict its possibilities. To understand why animals surviye, one must see evolution as a sieve-that only passes through its mesh those animals who leave more offspring than the rest. Many people also think that evolution favors life-although it is a painful fact that most mutated animals must die before they reproduce. But hindsight makes us tend to count only the survivors we see, while overlooking all the misfits that have disappeared; it is the same mistake that one might make from looking only at the sky-to then conclude that all the animals were birds. The animals we see today are precisely those whose ancestors accumulated a great many survival aids-and that is why so much of their behavior seems directed toward promoting their welfare-if only in the surroundings in which their ancestors evolved. It is an illusion that all those accumulated mechanisms have anything in common; actually, that seem- ing uniformity has no coherence of its own: it is nothing but the shadow of that evolutionary sieve. The myth of an underlying survival instinct explains nothing that cannot better be explained without it, and blinds us to the fact that each of those survival aids may exploit an entirely different mechanism. I certainly don't mean to deny that people learn to love life and to fear death. But this is no simple matter of obeying some elemental instinct. It involves the development over many years of elaborate societies of concepts. Nor do I mean to say that people are born without any instincts at all and must learn everything from experience. On the contrary, we start with many built-in fragments of machinery, and these predestine us to learn to shy away from diverse forms of pain, discomfort, insecurity, and other forms of bodily and mental harm. But com- pared to those instinctive fears, the state of nonexistence we call death is a far more strange and difficult idea, of which no infant can conceive. 6 EVOTUTION AND INTENT Could animals have evolved as they did, if \"nature\" had no sense of goal? A century ago, the world of biologists split in two: on one side stood the \"evolutionists,\" who held that animals evolve through nothing more than accidents of chance. Their antagonists were called the \"teleologists\"; they disbelieved that such excellent animals could evolve without any purposeful guidance. The evolutionists turned out to be right, for now we can watch small animals and plants evolve before our very eyes and , at a correspondingly slower pace, see similar develop- 3 1 7 A P P E N D I X\nments in creatures that have longer lives. In fact, we can actually observe how random acci- dents to genes lead to the selective survival of particular individuais in various envi uvrrLu Lv Svrrv\\) rvcru LL' Lrrs )slsutrvs SulVrval OI pafllcufaf lnOlVlOUalS ln VaflOUS envlfonmgnfg- without the faintest reason to s-uspect that any goals must be involved. So why do so many do so many people feel that evolution must have purposes? I iuspect that this belief is based on combining a sound insight about problem solving with an unsound image of how evolution works. l.-or example' common sense tells us that a person might never hit upon a design for a flyirrg machine entirely by trial and error, without having \"ry goals o, prrposes. This leads one to suppose that nature, too, must be subject to that same constraint. The error comes from thinking of \"nature\" as being concerned with such problems as finding a way to make animals fly. The trouble is that this confuses uses with purposes. For example, suppose one asked how birds evolved, while thoughtlessly assuming that feathers and wingi evolved exclusively for use in flight- One would be confronted with a formidable problem, since any organ as complex as a wing would require too many different genes to ever appear by random chaice. So long as one's mind is fixed on flight, one might f..t thrt the only solution is to find some flight advantage in each and every earlier stage that merely produced a protofeather or proto- wing too small and weak for actual flight. This is why ro -itry antievolltionists demani that evolutionary advocates must fill in every imagined \"gap\" along a direct path toward a specified goal. However, once we abandon that fixed idea, it is easie, to ,.\" how various intermediate developments could have provided those animals with advantages quite unrelated to flying. For example, the early ancestors of birds could have accumulated genes to manufacturl virious sorts of feathered appendages that helped to wrap those protobirds in body cloaks that kept them warm. This sort of fortuitous \"preparation\" unrelated to any goal of flight would have made it much more likely that other accidents, perhaps milliot r-of years lat\"er, might have brought a few such elements together to lend some glnuine aerial advantage to an animal already prone to making leaps. Incidentally, I do not mean to say that evolutionary processes must by their nature be devoid of purposes. We can actually conceive of how machine ry could exist inside an animal, to purposefully direct some aspects of its evolution in much the way a farmer can promote the evolution of chickens that bear more meat or sheep that grow more wool. Indeei, the repro- ductive machinery inside our cells has already evolved so as to produce variations ttrat \"r. -or\" likely to be useful than would otherwise occur by purely random chance; this idea is explained in a brilliant essay by Douglas Lenat, entitled \"The role of Heuristics in learning by Disc'overy,\" in Machine Learning: An Artificial lntelligence Approach, edited by R. Z. Michalski, l'l Carbonell, and T. M. Mitchell; Tioga Publishing Co., Palo Alto, Calif., 1983. It is even con- ceivable that our genetic systems might even contain some forms of difference-engine-like machinery that, over very long periods of time, generate variations in a somewhat puiposeful manner. To be sure, this is mere speculation, since no such system has yet- been dis- covered. In any case, one aftermath of the controversy with teleologists was that many scientists in other realms became so afraid of making similar mistakes that the very concept of purpose became taboo throughout science. Even today, most scientists regard it as an abomination to use \"anthropomorphic\" or \"intentional\" language in connection with anything but persons or higher animals. This burdened the science of psychology with a double-barreled handicap. On one side, it made psychologists regard many of their most important problems as outside the scope of scientific explanation. On the other side, it deprived them of many useful technical ideas-because such concept-words as \"want,\" \"expect,\" and \"recognize\" a1e among the most effective ever found for describing what happens in human minds. It was not until the \"cyber- netic revolution\" of the 1940s that scientists finally realized there is nothing inherently unscien- tific about the concept of goal itself and that attributing goals to evolution was bad not because it was impossible, but simply because it was wrong. Human minds do indeed use goal- machinety, and there is nothing wrong with recognizing this and bringing technical theories about intentions and goals into psychology. 3 1 8 A P P E N D I X\n7 INSI'I.ATION AND INTERACTION The hardest thing to understand is why we cdn understand anything at aII. - A I B E R T E t N s r n r n What hope is there for any human mind to understand a human brain? No one could ever memoriz. fh\" whole of all its small details. Our only hope is in formulating their principles. It wouldn't be much use, in any case, to know how each separate part works and how it interacts with the rest-because that simply isn't practical. Even if you knew all those details, if someone asked you to describe-in general terms-how brains work and how they change, you would have no way to reply. We usually like to think in positive terms about how various parts of systems interact. But to do that, we must first have good ideas about which aspects of a system do not interact-since otherwise there would be too many possibilities to consider. In other words, we have to under- stand insulations before we can comprehend interactions. To put this in a stronger form: No complicated society would actually work if it really depended on interactions dmong most of its parts. This is because any such system would be disabled by virtually any distortion, iniury, or environmental fluctuation. Nor could any such society evolve in the first place. The science of biology was itself shaped by the discovery of insulations. Plants and animals were scarcely understood at all until it was found that they were made of separate cells. Then little more was learned so long as scientists thought of cells as bags of fluid within which countless chemicals could freely interact. Today we know that cells are more like factories, containing systems that are kept apart by sturdy walls, with doors that open only to those substances that bear the proper keys. Furthermore, even within these compartments, most pairs of chemicals cannot interact except by permission of particular genes. Without those insulations, so many chemicals would interact that all our cells would die. For the purposes of this book, I have emphasized highly insulated systems-that is, mecha- nisms in which different functions are embodied in different agents. However, it is important to put this in perspective. For example, in chapter 19, we drew a sharp distinction between memorizers and recognizers; this made it easy to explain those ideas. However, in section 20.9 we mentioned very briefly the idea of a \"distributed memory,\" it which both those functions are combined in the same network of agents. Now I do not want the reader to take the brevity of that discussion to suggest the subject is not important. On the contrary,I suspect that most of the human brain is actually composed of distributed learning-systems and that it is extremely important for us to understand how they can work. It is possible to combine even more func- tions; for example, |ohn Hopfield has demonstrated a single distributed network that not only combines memory and recognition, but also \"correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size\"-in other words, an agency that \"closes the ring,\" much as described in section 19.10. See Hopfield's article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 79, p. 2554, 1982, or the book Parallel Distributed Processing by D. E,. Rumelhart and f . L. Mclelland, M.I.T. Press, 1986. The advantages of distributed systems are not alternatives to the advantages of insulated systems; the two are complementary. To say that the brain may be composed of distributed systems is not the same as saying that it is a distributed system-that is, a single network in which all functions are uniformly distributed. I do not believe any brain of that sort could work, because the interactions would be uncontrollable. To be sure, we have to explain how different ideas can become connected to one another-but we must also explain what keeps our separate memories intact. For example, we have praised the power of metaphors that allow us to com- bine ideas from different realms-but all that power would be lost if all our metaphors got mixed! Similarly, the architecture of a mind-society must encourage the formation and main- tenance of distinct levels of management by preventing the formation of connections between agencies whose messages have no mutual significance. Some theorists have assumed that dis- 3 t 9 A P P E N D I X\ntributed systems are inherently both robust and versatile, but actually those attributes are likely to conflict' Systems with too many interactions of different types will tend to be fragile, *frif\" systems with too many interactions of similar types will be ioo ,edundant to adapt to novel situations and requirements. Finally, distributed iystems tend to lack .*pii\"it, articulated rep- resentations, and this makes it difficult for any such agency to discov\"i ho.,' any other such agency works. Thus, if distributed memory-systems are widely used within our brains, as I suspect they are, that could be yet another reason for the shallowness of human consciousness. 8 EVOLUTION OF HUMAN THOUGHT What are the origins of human though t? Today, we're almost sure that our closest living relatives branched out according- to the dirgt\"- below. It shows that none of the species that still exist are directly descended from any of the others, but that they all share common ancestors, now long extinct. ORANGUTAN CHIMPANZEE ANTI-EVOLUTIONIST GOR]LLA How different are we human beings from all the other animals? We reco gnize how similar those various brains and bodies are. But in view of our exceptional abilities to speak and think, we certainly seem to-be unique..Could chimpanzees or goriilas ever learn to speak the way we do? Experience has shown that these tonderful animals -can indeed learn to make connections among hundreds of different words and ideas, enabling them to produce speechlike strings of symbol-signs for expressin g Trans-actions such as \"Pu{ the candy into the'bo*.\" Uo*.u.rl afr. same experiments appear to show that these animals find it much more difficult to conslruct language-strings in which the terminals of certain frames are filled with other filled-in frames. In other words, no one has succeeded in teaching these animals to use e*piessions that involve interruption clauses, such as \"P-ut the candy thal is in the pait into the 'box.\" To be ,ur., or' inability to teach such things does not prove that these animals are inherently incapable of them. Still, no one can doubt that *\" hru\" capabilities our ancestors did not possess. What sorts of brain developments could have given rise to our new and mighty forms of thoughp Here are some possible candidates: The capacity to attach new K-lines to old ones enabled us to build hierarchical memory-trees. The availability of more versatile temporary memories enabled. us to pursue subgoals and to tolerate more complicated kinds of interruptions. The evolution of paransrnss-fhat is, of isonomes that bridge (tcross multiple realms-enabled us to examine the same problem from seyeral iiewpoints. The emergence of additional layers of agents allowed each child to grow through more stages of development. COMMON ANCESTOR 320 A P P E N D I X\nNone of those advances by itself would seem to pose any special evolutionary difficulty. But what could have caused so many changes to have appeared so rapidly? Our ancestors diverged from their relatives, the gorillas and the chimpanzees, only a few million years ago, and-our human brains have gro*il substantially in only the last few hundred thousand years. Little is known of what happlned in that interval because we have found very few fossil remains of our ancestors. (This \"o\"ta be partly because their population was never very large but could also be because they had beco-. too smart to permit themselves to be fossilized.) The evolutionary interval was so brief that most of our genes and brain structures remain nearly the same- as those of the chimpanzees. Was it meiely an increase in the brain's size and capacity that produced our new abilities? Consider that, by itself, an increase in the size of the brain might fr,lv cause the disadvantage of mental confusion and the inconvenience of a heavier head. However, if we first evolved significant advances in the ability to manage orr memories' we could then take advantage of more memory. Similarly, inserting new layers of agents into old agencies rnight only leal to bad results-unless this were preceded by mechanisms for using sich layers as \"middle-level managers\" without disrupting older functions. In other words, our evolution must have worked the other way: first came enhancements in abilities that made it feasible for us to manage larger agencies. Then, once we had the capability for using more machinerv, natural selection could favor those who grew more massive brains. 32r A P P E N D I X\nPOSTSCRIPT AND ACKNOWIf; DGMENT Never speak more clearly than you think. - l s R E M y B s R N S T E T N This book assumes that any brain, machine, or other thing that has a mind must be com- posed of smaller things that cannot think at all. The structuie of the book itself reflects this view: each page explores a theory or idea that exploits what other pages do. Some readers might prefer a more usual form of story plot. I tried to do that sevetal times, but it never seemed to work; each way I tried to line things up left too many thoughts that would not fit. A mind is too complex to fit the mold of narratives that start out here and end up there; a human intellect depends upon the connections in a tangled web-which simply *o,rldn't work at all if it were neatly straightened out. Many psychologists dream of describing minds so economically that psychology would be- come as simple and precise as physics. But one must not confuse reality with dreams. It was not the ambitions of the physicists that made it possible to describe so much of the world in terms of so few and simple principles; that was because of the nature of our universe. But the operations of our minds do not depend on similarly few and simple laws, because our brains have accumulated many different mechanisms over aeons of evoiution. This means that psy- chology can never be as simple as physics, and any simple theory of mind would be bouni to miss most of the \"big picture.\" The science of psychology will be handicapped until we develop an overview with room for a great many smaller theories. To assemble the overview suggested in this book, I had to make literally hundreds of assump- tions. Some scientists might obiect to this on the ground that successful sciences like physics and chemistry have found it more productive to develop theories that make the fewest rrg-p- tions, eliminating everything that does not seem absolutely essential. But until we have a more coherent framework for psychology, it will remain too early for the task of weeding out un- proved hypotheses or for trying to show that one theory is better than another-since none of our present-day theories seem likely to survive very long in any case. Before we can have an image of the forest of psychology, we'll have to imagine more of its trees and restrain ourselves lrom simplifying them to death. Instead, we have to make ourselves complicated enough to deal with what is actually there. It is scarcely a century since people started to think effectively about the natures of the brain- machines that manufacture thoughts. Before that, those who tried to speculate about this were handicapped on one side by their failure to do experiments, particularly with young children, and on the other side by their lack of concepts for describing complicated machinery. Now, for the first time, mankind has accumulated enough conceptual tools to begin comprehending\nmachines with thousands of parts. However, we are only beginning to deal with machines that have millions of parts and we have barely started to acquire the concepts that we'll need to understand the biilion-part machines that constitute our brains. New kinds of problems always arise when one encounters systems built on larger, less familiar scales. Since most of the statements in this book \"r. rp\".nlations, it would have been too tedious to mention this on every page. Instead, I did the opposite-by taking out all words like \"possibly\" and deleting every ,\"f.r\"rrce to scientific evidence. Accordingly, this book should be read less as a text of scientffic scholarship and more as an adventure story for the imagination. Each idea should be seen not as a firm hypothesis about the mind, but as another implemelt to keep inside one's toolbox for makitrg ih.oties of the mind. Indeed, there is a sense in which that can be the only realistic way to [ni\"t about psychology-since every particular person's mind develops as a h,rg. -r\"hirre that grows in a somewhat different way. Are minds machines? Of that, I ve raised io doubt at all but haue only asked, what kind of machines? And though most people still consider it degrading to be regarded as machines, I hope this book will make them lntertain, instead, the tlioughiof how wonderful it is to be machines with such marvelous powers. Scientists like to credit those who first discovered each idea. But the central concept of this book, that the mind is a society of many smaller mechanisms, involved so many years of work to bring it to its present form that I can mention only a few of the people who had the most influence on it. In this research I shared the greatest privilege a human mind can have: to work on new ideas together with the foremost intellects of one's time. As a student at Harvard, I immersed mysef in mathematics and psychology and attached myself to two great young scientists, th; mathematician Andrew Gleason and the psychologist Georq. A- Miller. This was the era of the scientific movement that was later called cybernetics, and I was especially en- tranced with the works of Nicholas Rashevsky and of Warren McCulloch, who were making the first theories of how assemblies of simple cell-machines could do such things as recognize objects and remember what they'd seen. By the time I started graduate school in mathematics at princeton in 1950, I had a clear enough idea about how to make a multi-agent learning machine. George Miller obtained funds for building it; this was the Snarc machine of chapter 7. Constructed *itt the help of a fellow student, Dean Edmonds, it managed to learn in certain ways, but its limitations convinced me that a more versatile \"thinking machine\" would have to exploit many other princiPles. My teachl.s in the golden age of mathematics at Princeton were not particularly interested in psychology, but the ways of thought are more important than the subiect matter, and I leained newmental strategies from Albert Tucker, Ralph Fox, Solomon Lefshetz, John Tukey, Salomon Bochner, and John von Neumann. I learned even more from my own generation of students at Princeton: particularly from fohn Nash, Lloyd Shapley, Martin Shubik, and fohn McCarthy. In Lgr4I returned to Harvard as a funior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows, with no obligation but to pursue whatever goal seemed most important. There seemed no way to get \"ro1rrrd the apparent limitations of lowlevel, distributed-connection learning machines, ,o I trrtned toward i new theory being pioneered by Ray Solomonoff, about generalizing from experience. I attached myself to Warren McCulloch and Oliver Selfridge, with whom I worked most closely of all until becoming a professor of mathematics at MIT. It was from them that I derived my image of how to make a laboratory work. In 1959, Iohn McCarthy came to MIT from Dartmouth, and we started the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project. We agreed that the most critical problem was of how minds do common- sense ieasoning. McCarthy was more concerned with establishing logical and mathematical foundations for reasoning, while I was more involved with theories of how we actually reason using pattern recognition and analogy. This combination of theoretical and practical research attracted students of great ability, and our laboratory had an atmosphere that combined math- ematical power with engineering adventure; this led not only to new theories of computation, but also to developing some of the very first automatic robots. In 1963, McCarthy left to start a new AI laboratorv at Stanford, and now there were three principal centers of research in P O S T S C R I P T A N D A C K N O W T E D G M E N T 323\nArtificial Intelligence, including the one that Allen Newell and Herbert Simon had started earlier at Carnegie-Mellon U-niversity. A fourth center soon emerged at Stanford Research Laboratory, and we all worked closely together. The money to support the people-anJequipment for this work came mainly from an office of the Advanced Research Proie\"tt Ag\"n\"y \"orr\".rned with informatio; pr*essing technology. This office was directed, in.ffg\"!, by the scientists themselves, initially by Dr. I.C.R. Licklider, who had been my teacher and friend when I was a student at Harvard.'Licklider had already organized a research center at the Bolt, Beranek, and Newman company in Cambridge, Mas- sachusetts, and McCarthy and I and several of our students had workld iosely with that group for several years. Later, when Licklider returned to become a professor at MIT, the Information Processing Technology Office was taken over successively by Lawrence G. Roberts and Ivan S-utherland (who had been students of ours at MIT) ,r,d then by Robert Taylor and Robert Kahn-all of whom made important intellectual contributions. The actual details of all these research contracts were managed in the Ofhce of Naval Research by Marvin Denicoff, whose vision of the future had a substantial influence on the entire neid. My own research was supported by the ONR over an even longer period, since it had pr.uiourty nrrrr,.ed my graduate studies in topology at Princeton, and, r,tbr.q,rently, Denicoif's successor, Alan Meyrowitz, supported -y research during the completion br tni, book. ) ferome Wiesner and Philip Morse orMtT obtained the resources for our first laboratory. our development at MIT was encouraged by William Ted Martin, Norman Levinson, Witold Hu- rewicz, Norbert Weiner, Claude Shannon, Peter Elias, and Robert Fano. I was given the privilege of sharing with Shannon the endowed chair of Donner Professor of Science at MIT and enioyed the support of many oj!.1 people and organizations over the years: |ohn Williams, Daul Armer, and Merril Flood enabled -. lo work wiih Newell, Shaw, \"r,d Si-on at the Rand Corporation; O-li1er Selfridge and Gerald Dinneen encouraged research at MIT's Lincoln Lab- oratory; Michel Gouilloud supported my work from the Schlumberge, Corporation; Edward David provided support from Exxon; and Alan Kay supported -Jry of our students with funding from (successively) the Xerox, Atari, and Apple^corporations. For several years, the Thinking Machines Corporation has supported bottr ihir r.riarch and the development of a new type of computer called the Connection Machine-designed by -y student Danny Hillis for embodying societies of mind. e -- - Most of all, I want to acknowledge the contributions to this book of Seymour papert, who came to MIT in 1963 after five years of studying child development with fean piaget in Ge'eua. Papert and I worked so well together that foi a decade r\" ,,.rp\"rvised the labo\"ratory jointly, each able at any time to leave the other to decide what should be done. Togethe, *\" evolved new mathematical techniques, designed laboratory experiments, built computer hardware and software, and supervised the same students. Such a partnership could not have worked so well had wb not both developed in similar intellectual directions before we met; we were both involved with the same areas of mathematics, with similar concerns about machinery, and with similar attitudes about psychology. One of our projects was to build a machine that could see well enough to- use mechanical hands for solving real-world problems; this was the origin of Builder and the insights that emerged from it. Inlrying to -rL. that robot see, we founl that no single method ever worked well by itself. For example, the robot could rarely discern an obiect's shape by using vision alone; it also had to exploif otirer types of knowledge about which kinds of obiects were likely to be seen. This experilnce impressed on us the iJea that only a society of different kinds of processes could possibly suffice. Papert and I worked together not only on robotic machines, but in many other areas; for example, *e spent several yJ\"r, devel- oping a new mathematical theory for the then mysterious Perceptron typ\" of learning machine. In the middle 1970s Papert and I tried together to write a bobk abo.ri societies of mind but abandoned the attempt when it became clear that the ideas were not mature enough. The results of that collaboration shaped many earlier sections of this book. Eventually Papert and I both turned away from large-scale scientific enterprises toward some- what different individual goals, and we imposed the directorship of our laboratory upon one of 324 P O S T S C R I P T A N D A C K N O W T E D C M E N T\nour most original and productive students, Patrick Winston-who first worked out the idea of *\"kirrg unifr\"ames. papert went on to deueiop a host of new theories about mental development and education; these i.d to the computer language LoGo and to many other concepts that started to enter the mainstream of educational thought over the next decade. I focused my concern on searching for better theories about the little world of how a child might learn to build with blocks. Th\"e parts of the puzzle that form this book began to fit together in m-v mind in the mid-1970r, \"ror.rrrd the concept of frame-array, and this eventually led to the theories about communicationlines, K-lines, and level-bands, and then, during the book's final stages, to the ideas about pronomes, polynemes' and cross-realm correspondences' As for the manuscript itseif, Bradley Marx read through every draft, comparing each version with earlier ones, helping to maintain clarity, stylistic coherency, and especially protecting good ideas from destructive revisionary impulses. This was hard because the early manuscript was more than twice its present lengtir. noUi\" Lakoff suggested neutering the English; this seemed at first impossible but soon became quite natural. Theodore Sturgeon reviewed an early draft; I wish he had lived to see it now. Kenneth Haase, Betty Dexter, and Tom Beckman made innumerable suggestions and corrections. Successive drafts were reviewed by Danny Hillis, Steve Bagley, Marvin Denicoff, Charlotte Minsky, Michel Gouilloud, fustin Lieber, Philip Agr\", oaiia'wallace, Ben Kuipers, Peter de fong, and Sona Vogel. Richard Feynman contrib- uted a variety of insights about memory and pirallel processing. David Yarmush helped to iigiir\" the book into sections, to smooth out the transitions, and to establish the gradient wherein the words begin with commonsense meanings and gradually become more technical. Bob Whittinghill -ade many suggestions about language as well as about psychology. D_ouglas Hofstadter evaluated the entire tl-.ory, forcing me to make several substantial changes. Michael Crichton made many technical suggestions and helped me to refine the early chapters. Russell Noftsker and Tom Callahan made substantial engineering contributions to our work. Hosts of ideas came from students at MIT, notably Howard Austin, Manuel Blum, Danny Bobrow, Eugene Charniak, Henry Ernst, Tom Evans, Scott Fahlman , ka Goldstein, William Gosper,'Ricf,ard Greenblatt, Adolfo Guzman, Kenneth Haase, William Henneman, Carl Hew- iit, O\"\"\"y Hillis, |ack Holloway, Tom Knight, William N{artin, foel Moses, Bertram Raphael, Larry Roberts, fames Slagle, leny Sussman, Ivan Sutherland, David Waltz, Terry Winograd, patrick Winston, and -any others. Countless other thoughts came from working at various times with Maryann Amacher, Gregory Benford, Terry Beyer, Woodrow _Bledsoe, Mortimer Casson, Edward Feigenbaum, Edward Fredkin, Arnold Griffith, Louis Hodes, Berthold Horn, Joel Isaacson, RussEll Kirsch, David Kirsh, Robert Lawlor, fustin Leiber, Douglas Lenat, i.ro*. Lettvin, David MacDonald, Curtis Marx, Hans Moravec, Stewart Nelson, Nils Nills- son, Dor,ald Norman, Walter Pitts, ferry Pournelle, Charles Rosen, Carl Sagan, Roger Schank, Robert Sheckley, Stephen Smoliar, Cynthia Solomon, Ray Solomonoff, Luc Steels, Warren Teitelman, and Crarillla Tonfoni. I wish I could acknowledge the inspirations of all the friends of earlier years, particularly W. Ross Ashby, Thomas Etter, Ned Feder, Heinz von Foerster, Donald Hebb, ioi\" Hollander, Arnold Honig, Gordon Pask, Roland Silver, fan Syriala, Carroll Williams, B.rii\"* Wolfe, David Yarmush-and of all the teachers of my youth, particularly Dudley Fitts, Ruth Gordon, Alexander |oseph, Edward Lepowsky, anq Herbert Zim. My de- velopment was also strongly influenced first by the writing and later by the friendship of Arthur C. ilarke, Robert Heinlein, Frederick Pohl, and most of all by Isaac Asimov. Of course, the deepest influence on my style of thought came from my parents, Henry Minsky and Fannie Reiser. My wife, Gloria Rudisch, our children Margaret, Henry, and fuliana (who drew the illustrations and sometimes changed the text to make them fit), and my sister Ruth all helped to shape this book. My sister Charlotte also lives between these lines, for even in our childhood, she was a powerful artist and critic, and her dreams became the mean- ings of my ordinarY words. P O S T S C R I P T A N D A C K N O W T E D G M E N T 325\nGTOSSARY AND BIBIJOGR/A,PHY Because I thought this theory of the mind might interest not only specialists but everyone who thinks, I favored ordinary words over the tech'nical language of psychology. This was rarely any sacrifice becau,se so many psychological terms already\"stood for obsolete ideas. But since I also wished to speak to specialish, I trieJ to hide more technical ideas between the lines, if,op. this second level does not show. However there still were certain points at which no ordinary words seemed satisfactory, and I had to invent new terms or assign new meanings to old ones. Accumulation (12.6) A type of learning based on col_ lecting examples of an idea without attempting to describe what they have in common. Contrast with Uniframe. Agency (1.6) Any assembly of parts considered in terms of what it can accomplish as a unit, without regard to what each of its parts does by itself. Agent (1.4) Any part or process of the mind that bv itself is simple enough to understand-even though the interactions among groups of such agents may produce phenomena that are much harder to understand. Artificial Intelligen ce (7 .4) The field of research con- cerned with making machines do things that peo_ ple consider to require intelligence. There ii no clear boundary between psychology and Artificial Intelligence because the brain itself is a kind of machine. For an introduction to this field, I rec- ommend Patrick Winston's textbook Artificial ln- telligence, Addison-Wesley, 1984. For more connections with psychology, see Roger Schank and Kenneth Colby (eds.), Computer Models of Thought and Langudge, Freeman, 1973. Some in- fluential early ideas about brains and machines can be seen in Warren McCulloch's Embodiments of Mind, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1966. See lntelligence. Attachment Learnine Q7.2) The specific theory, proposed in this book, that the presence of some- one to whom we are emotionally attached has a special effect on how we learn, especially in in- fancy. Attachment learning tends to cause us to modify our goals-rather than merely improve our methods for achieving the goals we already have. B-Brain (6.4) AnV part of the brain connected not to the outside world, but only to another part of the same brain. Like a manager, a B-brain can super_ vise an A-brain without understanding eithe, ho* the A-brain works or the problems with which the A-brain is involved-for example, by recognizing patterns of activity that indicate the A-brain is con_ fused, wasting time in repetitive activity, or fo- cused on an unproductive level of detail. Block-Arch (12.1) A scenario adapted from patrick Winston's doctoral thesis, \"Learning Structural Descriptions by Examples,\" in The psychology of Computer Vision, P. H. Winston (ed.), Mcdra*_ Hill, 1975. The study of the world of children's building-blocks may at first seem childishlv simple, but it has been one of the most productive areai of research about Artificial Intelligence, child psy_ chology, and modern robotics engineering. Censor (27.2) An agent that inhibits or suppresses the operation of other agents. Censorlike agents are involved with how we learn from our mistakes. This idea played a prominent role in Freud,s theo_ ries but has been virtually ignored by modern ex- perimental psychologists-presumably because it is hard to study what people do not think. See Freud's 1905 book lokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious. I suspect censorlike agents may con_ stitute the larger part of human memory. The dis_ cussion of censors and jokes in chapter 27 is based on my essay \"fokes and Their Relation to the Coe_\nnitive Unconscious,\" published in Cognitive Con- straints on Communication, Representations and Processes,\" L. Vaina and I K.K. Hintikka (eds'), Reidel, 1981. See SuPPressors' Challenger, Professor (.il A rival of mine, disguised as the treacherous archaeologist in Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The LostWorld, who resembles Sher- lock Holmes's nemesis, the mathematician Mo- riarty, except for being somewhat more honorable' Closing the Ring (19.10) A technique by which an agency can recall many details of a memory from being given only a few \"cues.\" Common Sense (1.5) The mental skills that most people share. Commonsense thinking is actually more complex than many of the intellectual ac- complishments that attract more attention and re- ,p\".i, because the mental skills we call \"expertise\" often engage large amounts of knowledge but usu- ally employ only a few types of representations' In contrast, common sense involves many different kinds of representations and thus requires a larger range of different skills. Computer Science (6.S) A science still in its infancy' While other sciences study how particular types of obiects interact, computer science studies how in- teractions work in general-that is, how societies of parts can accomplish what those parts cannot do separately. Although computer science began with the study of serial computers-that is, of machines that could do only one thing at a time-it has grown to the point of studying the sorts of inter- connected networks of processes that must go on inside societies of mind. (For an introduction to the theory of single-process machines, see my book Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines, Pren- tice-Hall, 1967.) Consciousness (6.l) In this book, the word is used mainly for the myth that human minds are \"self- aware\" in the sense of perceiving what happens inside themselves. I maintain that human con- sciousness can never represent what is occurring at the present moment, but only a little of the recent past-partly because each agency has a limited ca- pacity to represent what happened recently and partly because it takes time for agencies to com- municate with one another. Consciousness is pe- culiarly hard to describe because each attempt to examine temporary memories distorts the very rec- ords it is trying to inspect. The description of con- sciousness in section 6.1 was adapted from my epilogue to Vernor Vinge's novel True Names, Blueiay Books, New York, 1984. Context (20.2) The effect upon one's state of mind of all the influences present at the time. At each moment, the context within which each agency works is determined by the activity of the nemes that reach that agency. See I'Jeme. Cross-Exclusion (16.4) An arrangement in which each of several agents is connected so as to inhibit all the others-so that only one of them can re- main active at a time' Cross-Realm Correspondence (29.4) A structure that has useful applications in two or more different mental realms. Such correspondences sometimes enable us to transfer knowledge and skill from one domain to another-without needing to accumu- late experience in that other realm. This is the basis of certain important kinds of analogies and metaphors. Creativitv (7.10) The myth that the production of novel ideas, artistic or otherwise, comes from some distinctive form of thought. I recommend the dis- cussion of this subject in the chapter \"Variations on a Theme as the Crux of Creativity,\" in Douglas Hofstadter's Metamagical Themas, Basic Books, 1985. Default Assumption (8.5, 12'12) The kind of as- sumption we make when we lack reasons to think otherwise. For example, we assume \"by default\" that an unfamiliar individual who belongs to a fa- miliar class will think and act like a \"typical\" mem- ber of that class. Default assumptions are more than mere conveniences; they constitute our most productive wav to make generalizations. Although such assumptions are frequently wrong, they usu- allv do little harm because they are automatically displaced when more specific information becomes available. However, they can do incalculable harm when they are held too rigidlY. Demon (27.L) An agent that constantly watches for a certain condition and intervenes when it occurs. Our discussion of demons is partly based on Eu- gene Charniak's doctoral thesis, \"Toward a Model of Children's Story Comprehension,\" MIT, 1972' Difference-Engine (7.8) An agency whose actions tend to make the present state of affairs more like some goal or \"desired state\" whose description is represented in that agency. This idea was devel- oped by Allen Newell, C. J. Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon into an important theory about human problem solving. See G. Ernst and Allen Newell, GPS, A Case Study in Generality and Problem Solving, Academic Press, 1969. Direction-Neme (24.6) An agent associated with a particular direction or region in space. I suspect that bundles of direction-nemes are used inside our brains for representing not only spatial locations and directions, but also for representing manli nonspatial concepts. Direction-nemes resemble isonomes in spatial realms but more resemble poly- nemes in other realms. See lnteraction-Square and Frame-Array. Distributed Memory (20.9) A representation in which each fragment of information is stored, not by making a single, substantial change in one agent, but by making small changes in many differ- ent agents. Many theorists have been led to believe that the construction of distributed memory- systems must involve \"nondigital\" devices such as G T O S S A R Y A N D B I B L I O G R A P H Y 327\nhokrgrams; that this is not so was shown by p. /. Willshaw, O. P. Buneman, and H. C. Longuei_ Higgins in \"lrJon-Holographic Associative Mem_ ory,\" Nature,222, 1969. See Memorizers. Duplication Problem (23.2) The question of how a mind could compare two simila, idrm without pos_ sessing two identical agencies for representing both of them at the same time. This protle- *as\"r,eue, recognized in older theories of psychology, and I suspect it will be the downfall of most i holistic\" theories of higher-level thought. See Time Blink_ tng. Emotion (16.1) A term used for too many differe't purposes. There is a popular view that emotions are inherently more complex and harder to under_ stand than other aspects of human thoueht. I maintain that infantile emotions are comparatiuely simple in character and that the complexity of adr-rlt emotions results from accumulating net_ rvorks of mutual exploitations. In adults, these networks eventuallv become indescribablv compli_ cated, but no more so than the networks of our adult \"intellectual\" structures. Bevond a certain point, to distinguish between the emotional and intellectual structures of an adult is merely to de_ scribe the sarne structures from different points of view. See Profo- specialist. Exploitation (4.5) The act of one agencv making use of tlie activity of another agency, without und.r_ standing how it works. Exploitation is the most usual relationship among agencies because it is so difficult for them to understand one another. Exception Principle (12.9) The concept that it may not pay to change a well-established skill in order to accommodate an exception. The more one builds upon a certain foundation, the greater the disruption upon changing it. A system's growth will tend to cease, past the point at which the damaee caused by any change outweighs the immediaie gain. See lnvestment Principle. Frame (24.2) A representation based on a set of ter_ minals to which other structures can be attached. Norrnallv, each terminal is connected to a default assumption, which is easily displaced by more spe_ cific information. Other ideas about frames that are not discussed within this book were published in mv chapter \"A Framework for Representing Knowledge,\" in Psychology of ComputerVision, p. H. Winston (ed.), McGraw-Hill, 1975. See picture- Frdnte, Trans-frame. Franre-Arruy (25.2) A famill,of frames that share the same terminals, Information attached to any ter_ minal of a frame-array automatically becomes available to all the frames of that array. This rnakes it easv to change perspective, not only in regard to a physical viewpoint, but in other mental realms as well. Frame-arravs are often controlled by bun- dles of direction-nemes. Functional Autonomy (17,4) goals can lead to subgoals 328 The idea that specific of broader character. For example, i-n order to please another individual, a child might develop more general goals of acquir_ ing knowledge, power, or wealthlvet the very same subgoals might serve equally well an initial wish to injure that other individual. The term \"functional autonomy\" derives from Gordon All_ port, who was one of my professors at Harvard. Functional Definition (12.4) Specifying somethins in terms of how it might be used, ,r[h., than ii terms of its parts and their relationships. See struc- tural Definition. Generate and Test (7.3) Solving a problem by trial and error-that is, by proposing solutions reck_ lessly, then rejecting those that do not work. Genius (7.l0) An individual of prodigious mental ac_ complishment. Although even the most outstand_ ing human prodigies rarely develop even twice as quickly as their peers, many people feel that their existence demands a special explanation. I suspect that the answer is to be found not in the superficial skills such people learn, but in the early accidents that lead them into learning better wdls to learn. Gestalt (2.3) The unexpected emergence, from a complex system, of a phenomenon that had not seemed inherent in that svstem's separate parts. Such \"ernergent\" or \"collective\" phenomen, ,ho* that \"a whole is more than the sum of its parts.\" However, further research usually shows thai such phenomena can be explained completely, once we also take into account the interactions among those parts-as well as the peculiarities and defil ciencies in the observer's own perceptions and ex_ pectations. There do not seem to be any important principles common to the phenomena that have been considered, from time to time, to be ,,emer_ gent\"-beyond the contemporary inability to un_ derstand them. Thus, \"holistic\" views tend to become scientific handicaps when they undermine our determination to extend the boundaries of our comprehension. See lnteraction. Goal (7.8) The representation in a difference-engine of an imagined final state of affairs. This definition of goal may at first seem too impersonal because it does not explain either the elation that comes with achieving a human goal or the frustration that ac_ companies failure. However, we should not expect to explain such complicated phenomena of adult psychology directlv in terms of simple principles, since they also depend on many other aspects of our mental architecture. Basing our concept of goal on the difference-engine idea helps us to avoid the single-agent fallacy by permitting us to speak about a goal without needing to refer to the person who entertains that goal; a person's many agencies may each have different goals-without that per_ son being \"aware\" of them. Grammar-Tactic (22.10) An operation involved with speech that corresponds to a step in a process of constructing a mental representation. Grammar_ tactics are not the sante as \"grammar rules,\" al_ G T O S S A R Y A N D B I B T I O G R A P H Y\nthough these have a close relation. The difference is that grammar rules are both superficial and sub- iective-in the sense that they purport to describe regularities in one person's behavior as observed by ,orn\"ott\" else-while grammar-tactics are obiec- tive in the sense that they are defined to be the underlying processes that actually produce speech' Although it may be more difficult to discover iust what those processes do, it is better to speculate on how language is produced and used than merely to describe its observed, external forms. Holism (2.3) See Gestalt. Homunculus (5.2) Literally, a tiny person. In psy- chology, the unproductive and paradoxical idea that a person's behavior depends upon the behav- ior of another personlike entity located deeper in- side that person. Interaction-Square (14'9) The idea of representing the interaction between two processes by linking pairs of examples to direction-nemes. We can use this same technique not only for representing spa- tial relationships, but for causal, temporal, and many other kinds of interactions. This makes the interaction-square idea a powerful scheme for rep- resenting cross-realm conespondences. Interaction (2.1) The effect of one part of a system upon another part. It is remarkable that in the his- tory of science virtually all phenomena have even- tually been explained in terms of interactions between parts taken two at a time' For example, Newton's law of gravity, which describes the mu- tual attraction of two particles, enables us to pre- dict the motions of all the planets, stars, and galaxies-without any need to consider three or more obiects at a time! One could conceive of a universe in which whenever three stars formed an equilateral triangle, one of them would instantly disappear-but virtually no three-part interactions have ever been observed in the physical world. Interruption (15.9) A term used in this book to refer to any process that can be suspended while the agency involved can do some other job-yet later return to where it left off. The ability to do this requires some sort of temporary memory. See Re- cursion PrinciPle. Intelligence (7.1) A term frequently used to express the myth that some single entity or element is re- sponsible for the quality of a person's ability to rea- son. I prefer to think of this word as rePresenting not any particular power or phenomenon, but sim- ply all the mental skills that, at any particular mo- ment, we admire but don't yet understand. Introspection (6.5) The myth that our minds possess the ability directly to perceive or apprehend their own operations. Intuition (12.10) The myth that the mind possesses some immediate (and hence inexplicable) abilities to solve problems or perceive truths. This belief is based on naive views of how we get ideas. For ex- ample, we often experience a moment of excite- ment or exhilaration at the moment of completing a complex and prolonged but nonconscious analy- sis of a problem. The mvth of intuition wrongly attributes the solution to what happened in that final moment. As for being able directly to appre- hend what is true, we simply forget how frequently our \"intuitions\" turn out wrong' Investment Principle (Ia.6) The tendency of any well-developed skill to retard the growth of similar skills because the latter work less well in their early forms-and hence are used so infrequently that they never reach maturity. Because of this, we tend to invest most of our time and effort on elab- orating a comparatively few techniques, rather than on accumulating many different ones. This can lead, at the same time, both to the formation of a coherent and effective personal style and to a decline in flexibility that mav be wrongly attributed to aging. See Exception Principle' Isonome (22.L) A signal or pathway in the brain that has similar effects on several different agencies. K-Line (8.1) The theory that certain kinds of memo- ries are based on turning on sets of agents that reactivate one's previous partial mental states. This idea was first described in my essay \"K-lines: A Theory of Memory,\" Cognitive Science, 4 (2), April 1980. Learning (7.5) An omnibus word for all the processes that lead to long-term changes in our minds. Level-Band (S.5) The idea that a typical mental pro- cess tends to operate, at each moment, only within a certain range or portion of the structure of each agency. This makes it possible for one process to work on small details without disrupting other processes that are concerned with large-scale plans. Logical Thinking (18.1) The popular but unsound theory that much of human reasoning proceeds in accord with clear-cut rules that lead to foolproof conclusions. In my view, we employ logical reason- ing only in special forms of adult thought, which are used mainly to summarize what has already been discovered. Most of our ordinary mental work -that is, our commonsense reasoning-is based more on \"thinking bv analogy\"-that is, applying to our present circumstances our representations of seemingly similar previous experiences. Memorizer (19.5) An agent that can reset an agency into some previously useful state. See Recognizer and Distributed Memory. Memory (15.3) An omnibus term for a great many structures and processes that have ill-defined boundaries in both everyday and technical psy- chology; these include what we call \"re-member- iag,\" \"re-collecting,\" \"re-minding,\" and \"re- cognizing.\" This book suggests that what these share in common is their involvement with how we reproduce our former partial mental states. Mental State (8.4) The condition of activity of a group of agents at a certain moment. In this book G T O S S A R Y A N D B I B L I O G R A P H Y 329\nwe have assumed that every agent, at any moment, is either completely aroused or completely quies_ cent; in other words, we ignore the possibility of different degrees of arousal. This kind of ,,two_ state\" or \"digital\" assumption is characteristic of computer science and, at first, may seem too sim_ plistic. However, experience has shown that the so_ called analog theories that are alleged to be more realistic quickly become so complicated that, in the end, the simpler two-state models actually lead to deeper understandings-at least about basic prin_ ciples. See Partial Mental State. Metaphor (29.8) The myth that there is a clear dis_ tinction between representations that are ,,realis- tic\" and those that are merely suggestive. In their book Metaphors We Live By, University of Chicago Press, 1980, Mark fohnson and George Unoff demonstrate that metaphor is no mere special de_ vice of literary expression but permeates virtually every aspect of human thought. Micromemory (15.8) The smallest components of our short-term memory-systems. Microneme (20.5) A neme involved with agents at a relatively low level. See Neme. Model (30.3) Any structure that a person can use to sirnulate or anticipate the behavior of somethine else. Neme (25.6) An agent whose output represents a fragrnent of an idea or state of mind. The .,context,' within which a typical agent works is largelv deter- mined by the activit-v of the nemes that reach it. I called nemes \"C-lines\" in \"Plain Talk About Neurodevelopmental Epistemology,\" in proceed- ings af the Fifth lnternational loint Conference on Artifrcial Intelligence, Cambridge, Mass. , 1977; the description in section 20.5 is also based on the idea of \"microfeature\" developed by David L. Waltz and Jordan Pollack in \"Massively parallel Parsing,\" Cognitive Science,9 (l) Nome (25.6) An agent whose outputs affect an agency in some predetermined manner, such as a pronome, isonome, or paranome; an agent whose effect depends more on genetic architecture than on learning from experience. The suffix -nome was chosen to suggest an atom-like, unchanging qual- itv. Noncompromise Principle (3.2) The idea that when tlvo agencies conflict it may be better to ignore them both and yield control to yet another, inde- pendent agency. Papert's Principle (10.4) The hypothesis that many steps in mental growth are based less on the acqui- sition of new skills than on building new adminis- trative systems for managing already established abilities. Paranome (29.3) An agent that operates on agencies of several different mental realms at once. with similar effects on all of them. Partial Mental state (s.4) A description of the state of activity of some particular group of mental agents. This technical but simple idea makes it easy to understand how one can entertain and com_ bine several ideas at the same time. See Mental State. Perceptron (19.7) A type of recognition machine that learns to weigh evidence. Invented by Frank Ro_ senblatt in the late 1950s, perceptrons use singu_ larly simple procedures for learning which weigllts to assign to various fragments of eviden... S.u_ mour Papert and I analyzed this type of machine in the book Perceptrons, MIT press, 1969, and showed that the simplest kinds of perceptrons can_ not do very much by themselves. However, they can do much more when arranged into societies so that some of them can then learn to recogni ze re_ lations among the patterns recognized bylhe oth_ ers. It seems quite likely that some types of brain cells use similar principles. Picture-Frames (24.7) A type of frame whose termi_ nals are controlled by direction-nemes. picture_ frames are particularly suited to representing cer_ tain kinds of spatial information. Polyneme (19.5) An agent that arouses different ac_ tivities, at the same time, in different agencies_as a result of learning from experience. Contrast with lsonome. Pronome (21. l) A type of agent associated with a par- ticular \"role\" or aspect of a representation-corre- sponding, for example, to the Actor, Traiectory, or Cause of some action. Pronome agents frequently control the attachments of terminals of frames to other frames; to do this, a pronome must possess some temporary memory. Proto-specialist (16.3) One of the genetically con- structed subsystems responsible for some of an an- imal's \"instinctive\" behavior. Large portions of our minds start out as almost separate proto-specialists, and we interpret their activity as manifesting differ- ent, primitive emotions. Later, as agencies become more interconnected and learn to exploit one an- other, these differences grow less distinct. This conception is based on the societylike theory pro- posed by Niko Tinbergen inThe Study of lnstinct, Oxford University Press, 1951. Przzle Principle (7.3) The idea that any problen can be solved by trial and error-provided one already has some way to recognize a solution when one is found. See Generate and Test. Realm, Mental (29.1) A division of the mind that deals with some distinct variety of concern by using distinct mechanisms and representations. Recognizer (19.6) An agent that becomes active in response to a particular pattern of input signals. Recursion Principle (15. I l) The idea that no society, however large, can overcome every limitation- unless it has some way to reuse the same agents, over and over again, for different purposes. See lnterruption. B I B I , I O G R A P H Y G T O S S A R Y A N D\nReformulation (13. l) Replacing one representation of something by another, different type of repre- sentation. Representation (21.6) A structure that can be used as a substitute for something else, for a certain pur- pose, as one can use a map as a substitute for an actual city. See Functional Definition and Model. Re-duplication Theory of Speech (22.10) My con- jecture about what happens when a speaker ex- plains an idea to a listener. A difference-engine- like process tries to construct a second copy of the idea's representation inside the speakeis mind. Each mental operation used in the course of that duplication process activates a corresponding grommdr-tactic in the language-agency, and these lead to a stream of speech. This will result in com- munication to the extent that suitably matched \"inverse grammar-tactics\" construct, inside the lis- ter^r's mind, an equivalent representation. Script (13.5) A sequence of actions produced so au- tomatically that it can be performed without dis- turbing the activities of many other agencies. The action script in section 21.7 accomplishes this by eliminating all the higher-level managers like Puf and Gef. A script-based skill tends to be inflexible because it lacks bureaucracy; one gains speed by removing higherJevel anchor points but loses ac- cess to alternatives when things go wrong; script- based experts run the risk of becoming inarticulate. The book by Roger Schank and Robert Abelson, Scripts, Goals, Plans and Understanding, Erlbaum Associates , 1977, speculates about the human use of scripts. Self (4.1) In this book, when written \"Self,\" the myth that each of us contains some special part that em- bodies the essence of the mind. When written as \"self,\" the word has the ordinary sense of a person's individuality. See Single-Agent Fallacy. Sensor (11.1) An agent whose inputs are sensitive to stimuli that come from the world outside the brain. Single-Agent Fallacy (4.1) The idea that a person's thought, will, decisions, and actions originate in some single center of control, instead of emerging from the activity of complex societies of processes. Simulation (2.4) A situation in which one system mimics the behavior of another. In principle, a modern computer can be used to simulate any other kind of machine. This is important for psy- chology, because in the past, there was usually no way for scientists to confirm their expectations about the consequences of a complicated theory or mechanism. The theories in this book have not yet been simulated, partly because they are not speci- fied clearly enough and partly because the older computers lacked enough capacity and speed to simulate enough agents. Such machines have re- cently become available; for an example, see W. Daniel Hillis's doctoral thesis, \"The Connection Machine,\" MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1985. Simulus (16.8) An illusion that a certain thing is pres- ent, caused by a process that evokes, at higher lev- els of the mind, a state resembling the state of mind that would be caused by that thing's actual pres- ence. (A new word.) Society (l.l) In this book, an organization of parts of a mind. I reserved the term \"community\" for refer- ring to organizations of people because I did not want to suggest that a human mind resembles a human community in any particular way. Society of More (10.2) The agents used by a mind to make comparisons of quantities. Stage of Development (16.2) An episode in the growth of a mind. Chapter 17 offers several reasons why complicated systems tend to grow in se- qlrences of episodes, rather than through processes of steady change. State of Mind (8.4) See Mental State. Structural Definition (12.4) Describing something in terms of the relationships among its parts. Contrast with Func tional Definition. Suppressor (27.2) A censorlike agent that works bv disrupting a mental state that has already occurred. Suppressors are easier to construct than censors, and require less memory, but are much less effi- cient. Time Blinking (23.3) Finding differences between two mental states bv activating them in rapid succession and noticing which agents change their states. I suspect it is bv using this method that our brains avoid the duplication problem mentioned in section 23.2. Time blinking might be one of the synchronized activities of brain cells that gives rise to \"brain waves.\" Traiectory' (21.6) Literally, the path or route of an action or activity. However, we use this word not only for a path in space, but, by analogv, for other realms of thought. See Pronome. Trans-Frame (21.3) A particular type of frame that is centered around the trajectory between two situa- tions, one for \"before\" and the other for \"after.\" The theories in this book about Trans-frames owe much to Roger Schank. See his book, Conceptual I nformation P roc ess i ng, N orth-Holl and, I 97 5 . Unconscious (17.10) A term often used, in common- sense psychology, to refer to areas of thought that are actively barred or censored against introspec- tion. ln this book we take \"conscious\" to mean aspects of our mental activity of which we are aware. But since there are very few such processes, we must consider virtually everything done bv the mind to be unconscious. Uniframe (12.1) A description designed to represent whichever common aspects of a group of things can be used to distinguish them from other things. Will, Freedom of (30.6) The myth that human voli- tion is based upon some third alternative to either causality or chance. 331 G L O S S A R Y A N D B I B T I O G R A P H Y\nADDITIONAT REFERENCES Several sections of this book were adapted from my earlier publications.

How do children learn the complexities of language so fast? Grammatical Man explains these and other puzzles through one of the newest branches of science, information theory. lt shows how even the most complex systems are - based on a few basic rules, a simple grammar. Lu- cidly, sometimes lyrically, Jeremy Campbell shows how this powerful newfound science enriches and unifies an amazing diversity of fields. From our genes to our dreams, from language to telecom- munications, everything in our lives follows the rules of information. o-671-44062-4 $9.9s n The Universe Within A New Science Explores the Human Mind By Morton Hunt Refuting the idea that our actions are largely deter- mined by our genes, The Universe Within argues that it is our intellectual ability that makes us differ- ent from any other life form. How the mind stores, processes and recalls 100 trillion bits of information, how the human brain evolved, how we create an internal universe of symbols that in turn manipulates the physicaluorld-Hunt presents a wide range of new discoveries and speculations on these and other matters. \"The mostcomplete, factual, and im- aginative presentation of the fieldl' -Los Angeleslimes o-671-252s9-3 $12.9s Name (Please Print) Address Zip Code Prices subjeci to change without notice\n"

The internet is the biggest source of text, but unfortunately, extracting text from arbitrary HTML pages is a hard and painful task.Let's suppose we need to extract full text from various web pages, and we want to strip all HTML tags. Typically, the default solution is to use get_text method from BeautifulSoup package, which internally uses lxml. It's a well-tested solution, but it can be very slow when working with hundreds of thousands of HTML documents due to the libxml2 dependency.By replacing BeautifulSoup with selectolax, you can get a 5-30x speedup almost for free!Here is a simple benchmark which parses 10 000 HTML pages from commoncrawl:# coding: utf-8\n\nfrom time import time\n\nimport warc\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom selectolax.parser import HTMLParser\n\n\ndef get_text_bs(html):\n    tree = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')\n\n    body = tree.body\n    if body is None:\n        return None\n\n    for tag in body.select('script'):\n        tag.decompose()\n    for tag in body.select('style'):\n        tag.decompose()\n\n    text = body.get_text(separator='\\n')\n    return text\n\n\ndef get_text_selectolax(html):\n    tree = HTMLParser(html)\n\n    if tree.body is None:\n        return None\n\n    for tag in tree.css('script'):\n        tag.decompose()\n    for tag in tree.css('style'):\n        tag.decompose()\n\n    text = tree.body.text(separator='\\n')\n    return text\n\n\ndef read_doc(record, parser=get_text_selectolax):\n    url = record.url\n    text = None\n\n    if url:\n        payload = record.payload.read()\n        header, html = payload.split(b'\\r\\n\\r\\n', maxsplit=1)\n        html = html.strip()\n\n        if len(html) > 0:\n            text = parser(html)\n\n    return url, text\n\n\ndef process_warc(file_name, parser, limit=10000):\n    warc_file = warc.open(file_name, 'rb')\n    t0 = time()\n    n_documents = 0\n    for i, record in enumerate(warc_file):\n        url, doc = read_doc(record, parser)\n\n        if not doc or not url:\n            continue\n\n        n_documents += 1\n\n        if i > limit:\n            break\n\n    warc_file.close()\n    print('Parser: %s' % parser.__name__)\n    print('Parsing took %s seconds and produced %s documents\\n' % (time() - t0, n_documents))\n>>> ! wget https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-05/segments/1516084886237.6/warc/CC-MAIN-20180116070444-20180116090444-00000.warc.gz\n>>> file_name = \"CC-MAIN-20180116070444-20180116090444-00000.warc.gz\"\n>>> process_warc(file_name, get_text_selectolax, 10000)\nParser: get_text_selectolax\nParsing took 16.170367002487183 seconds and produced 3317 documents\n>>> process_warc(file_name, get_text_bs, 10000)\nParser: get_text_bs\nParsing took 432.6902508735657 seconds and produced 3283 documents\nClearly, it's not the best way to benchmark something, but it gives an idea that selectolax can be sometimes 30 times faster than lxml.I wrote selectolax while looking for a fast HTML parser in Python. It is a Cython wrapper to the Modest and lexbor engines. Both engines are very fast HTML5 parsers written in pure C by lexborisov. Despite the speed, they follow all the standards when parsing HTML and handle malformed HTML the same way modern browsers do.Selectolax is not limited to only one use case and supports CSS selectors as well as other HTML traversing functions. Any feedback and feature requests are appreciated, so you should definitely give it a try ;).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask them via e-mail displayed in the footer.

Selectolax is a fast HTML parser that uses CSS selectors to locate and extract data from HTML. It uses the Modest and Lexbor libraries to parse HTML, but this is an implementation detail and you don’t need to know anything about them to use Selectolax. In this document, I will try to illustrate the main features of Selectolax using examples. Installing Selectolax Selectolax is on PyPI, so you can install it with pip: $ python3 -m pip install selectolax\n or $ pip3 install selectolax\n It can work inside a virtual environment or globally.

In the examples, we will use requests to fetch HTML from the web, and selectolax to parse it. Leo’s blog title Let’s get some HTML from my blog as a quick example. To turn the HTML from a string into a tree, you can use the selectolax.parser.HTMLParser class. You can pass this class a string, or just pass bytes and let it figure out the encoding.  In [3]:html = requests.get('https://www.gkbrk.com').text\ntree = selectolax.parser.HTMLParser(html)  Let’s start with a simple example, and extract the title of the page.  In [4]:title = tree.css_first('title').text()\ntitle   Out [4]:'Gokberk Yaltirakli'  Leo’s blog posts That wasn’t too hard, that is indeed the title of my website. Let’s try something a little more complicated. My home page has a list of recent posts, and it’s not too far fetched to imagine that we might want to extract the title and URL of each post. Let’s try that.  In [5]:articles = tree.css('article > ul > li')\n\ntitles = []\ndates = []\n\nfor article in articles:\n    title = article.css_first('b').text()\n    url = article.css_first('a').attrs['href']\n    date = article.css_first('time').text()\n\n    titles.append(title)\n    dates.append(date)\n\npd.DataFrame({'title': titles, 'date': dates}).head()   Out [5]:\n.dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type{vertical-align:middle}.dataframe tbody tr th{vertical-align:top}.dataframe thead th{text-align:right}\n\n  \n    \n      \n      title\n      date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Shell scripts as a poor man's AppImage\n      2023-04-28\n    \n    \n      1\n      Earthquake data for Turkey\n      2022-11-26\n    \n    \n      2\n      A Brief Overview of Mastodon\n      2022-11-19\n    \n    \n      3\n      Memorable Unique Identifiers (MUIDs)\n      2022-10-10\n    \n    \n      4\n      Status Update, May 2022\n      2022-05-15\n    \n  \n\n  Pretty easy, right?

Gibbs, Jr. Metaphor and Thought: The State of the Art The publications of the ﬁrst and second editions of Metaphor and Thought (Cam- bridge University Press) in 1979 and 1993, respectively, under the editorship of Andrew Ortony, were monumental events in the world of metaphor research. The 1979 edi- tion was the ﬁrst interdisciplinary volume devoted to metaphor that included contri- butions from notable scholars in philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and political science. Many of the articles in that volume are now classics and continue to be frequently cited among active metaphor researchers. Several other articles from scholars in linguistics and psychology were added to the 1993 edition, which too has been widely read and dis- cussed. But much has changed in the world of metaphor since 1993. There is now a huge body of empirical work from many aca- demic disciplines that clearly demonstrates the ubiquity in metaphor in both everyday and specialized language. Most importantly, there is also signiﬁcant research indicating the prominence of metaphor in many areas of abstract thought and in people’s emo- tional and aesthetic experiences. Metaphor is not simply an ornamental aspect of lan- guage, but a fundamental scheme by which people conceptualize the world and their own activities. The primary purpose of the Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought is to describe some of the key developments in contemporary metaphor research that detail the contribution of metaphor to human cognition, communica- tion, and culture. There are several distinguishing features of this handbook. First, metaphor scholar- ship has signiﬁcantly advanced from purely speculative accounts of how metaphor works and is understood, primarily based on the analysis of a few, isolated linguistic exam- ples. There is now much greater attention to the ways that context shapes metaphor use and understanding. Much of this work comes from experimental studies, but an increasing number of corpus studies, both small and large scaled, demonstrate some of the complexities associated with mak- ing general claims about the structure and 3\n4 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR. function of metaphors in language and thought. Indeed, many of the chapters in this volume address the beneﬁts and limitations of different methods for doing metaphor analysis, both at a local level for identifying individual instances of metaphor in language and nonverbal expression and at a global level for reliably inferring larger-scale pat- terns of metaphorical thought from public manifestations of metaphor. More generally, the vast literature on metaphor has used a variety of analytic techniques to investigate empirically the broad extent of metaphor in human life. Second, there is now a greater emphasis on situating metaphor studies within broad, comprehensive models of human cogni- tion, communication, and culture. Although metaphor is clearly an important topic in its own right, the empirical study of metaphor has broader implications for theories of mind and meaning, especially in showing the prominence of metaphorical thought in everyday life. But theories of metaphor are now, more than ever, linked to detailed the- oretical frameworks that aim to describe the underlying nature of language, thought, and communication. Many of the authors in this volume view metaphor as part of a larger sys- tem of human cognition and communicative practices and consequently do not believe that verbal and nonverbal metaphor requires extraordinary human effort to be produced and understood. Moreover, seeing metaphor as a natural outcome of human minds also points to new ways in which metaphor is related to a variety of other linguistic forms and cognitive activities. Third, and related to the previous point, metaphor scholarship now focuses greater attention to how metaphor comes into being in both thought and communication. The traditional interest in metaphor cen- tered on the question of how people under- stand novel metaphorical language, with the implicit assumption that the creation of these poetic ﬁgures was attributed to spe- cial individuals with signiﬁcant artistic tal- ents. But the articles in this collection place greater emphasis on where metaphors come from (e.g., brains, bodies, and culture), why metaphor is so prominent in language and thought, and how public manifestations of metaphor (e.g., language, art, music) are speciﬁcally constrained by different commu- nicative and emotional forces. In this way, the scope of metaphor studies has expanded enormously in recent years to cover the spec- trums from brains to culture and from lan- guage and gesture to art and music. Fourth, the incredible rise in the sheer number of scholarly works on metaphor in different academic ﬁelds illustrates a heightened sensitivity to metaphor. This increased attention demonstrates how schol- ars in virtually every discipline (e.g., math- ematics, law, music, art) can contribute to understanding the functions and meanings of metaphor. Thus, research on metaphor is now as multidisciplinary, and interdisci- plinary, as perhaps any topic being studied in contemporary academia. One result of this explosion of research on metaphor is a marvelous interaction between basic and applied scholarship, such that ﬁndings on the ways that metaphors are employed in real- world contexts offer important constraints on general theories of metaphor. Metaphor does not always appear in nice, neat packages that can be easily plucked out from some context for analysis. Speakers use metaphor- ical language, and engage in metaphorical thought, in complex, often contradictory patterns that make simple conclusions about both the ubiquity and structure of metaphor difﬁcult to make. Rather than retreat back to made-up, isolated examples, many con- temporary scholars exhibit great enthusiasm for uncovering the messy reality of metaphor use and the implications of such ﬁndings for comprehensive theories of metaphor. Fifth, the interdisciplinary nature of metaphor studies now allows for greater recognition of the complex ways that metaphor arises from the interaction of brains, bodies, languages, and culture. Most earlier work conducted within traditional disciplinary frameworks aims to singularly locate metaphor as part of, for exam- ple, language (linguistics), mind (psychol- ogy), or culture (anthropology), with few scholars ever acknowledging the ubiquity\nMETAPHOR AND THOUGHT 5 of metaphor in other domains of experi- ence such as gesture, art, and music. This often created unproductive tension between metaphor scholars as individuals defended their own “turf” and methods as being the best way to understand the essence of metaphor and its interpretation. Contempo- rary metaphor scholarship, as seen in many of the present chapters, has properly shown how the analysis of speciﬁc metaphoric language in context, for instance, reveals the simultaneous presence of neural, lin- guistic, psychological, and cultural forces. This complexity, again, makes it difﬁcult to offer sweeping, simplistic conclusions about metaphor, where it comes from and how it is used by real human beings in nat- uralistic contexts. But this trend to seek out language–mind–culture interactions in metaphor studies offers the best hope for understanding the prominence of metaphor in human understanding, yet one that appre- ciates the subtleties of human meaning- making practices shaped by a variety of linguistic and nonlinguistic sources. Finally, several chapters in this volume give witness to the struggle that I refer to as the “paradox of metaphor,” in which metaphor is creative, novel, culturally sensi- tive, and allows us to transcend the mun- dane while also being rooted in pervasive patterns of bodily experience common to all people. Traditional metaphor scholars, and metaphor enthusiasts, typically resist argu- ments, and empirical ﬁndings, either sug- gesting the conceptual roots or embodied foundation for metaphorical thought and language. These critics see metaphor as a special rhetorical device that enables us to transcend momentarily above the ordinary literal world. Linking metaphor to the body, or entrenched conceptual thought, as in the idea of “conceptual metaphor,” seems to some as far too reductive and dismis- sive of the power of metaphoric language to reshape our imagination. Yet advocates of entrenched patterns of metaphorical thought readily acknowledge metaphor’s ability in both verbal and non- verbal forms to create new modes of under- standing often accompanied by special aes- thetic pleasures. In many instances, however, creative, poetic metaphors are extensions of enduring schemes of metaphorical thought and not necessarily created de novo. Under- standing how metaphor is both fundamental to many aspects of thought and yet special for creative language and artworks is a chal- lenge taken up by several authors in this vol- ume. My hope is that readers interested in the aesthetic qualities of metaphor will take the time to explore some of the proposals on the conceptual and embodied grounding for metaphorical thought and will see how this research draws connections between what is simultaneously ordinary and spectacular about metaphor. All of the authors contributing to this volume are distinguished scholars from different academic ﬁelds who have done important work on metaphor and related poetic ﬁgures. The interdisciplinary world of metaphor scholarship is so large, with liter- ally hundreds of excellent researchers mak- ing new discoveries all the time. A hand- book like this one can only provide a forum for a small subset of this outstanding group of researchers, but I am pleased to present the new thoughts of the present contributors because their work is among the most widely recognized and discussed within the ﬁeld. Not surprisingly, there are many areas of dis- agreement among the present contributors both in terms of the methods employed to do metaphor analysis and the resulting theo- ries proposed to account for different aspects of metaphor in language, thought, and cul- ture. Yet I am happy with this diversity of methods and theories because the topic of metaphor and thought is not one that is likely to be comprehensively characterized by any one perspective. Contributors to this handbook were en- couraged to write about their latest ideas but to do so in a way that readers new to the topic, or less familiar with the research on some facet of metaphor, will be read- ily able to recognize the signiﬁcance of these ideas and proposals for ongoing think- ing and research on metaphor. The hand- book is divided into ﬁve general sections: (1) the roots of metaphor, (2) metaphor\n6 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR. understanding, (3) metaphor in language and culture, (4) metaphor in reasoning and understanding, and (5) metaphor in nonver- bal expression. I hasten to note, however, that each chapter in the volume addresses major foundational themes on the relations between metaphor, thought, and under- standing. A brief overview of each contri- bution is presented. The Roots of Metaphor The ﬁrst section offers several contrasting visions on where metaphor comes from and how metaphor serves as the often unknow- ing foundation for human thought. George Lakoff’s chapter describes new advances in the brain sciences and neu- ral computation relevant to metaphor (“The Neural Theory of Metaphor”). Links between brain and body are central to understanding the nature of thought, and metaphor is no exception. The neural theory follows developments in simulation seman- tics in which the neural circuitry character- izing the meanings of words, like “grasp,” is also activated when one imagines or per- ceives grasping. This sense of meaning as mental stimulation is applied to the creation and use of metaphorical patterns such as those associated with “grasping concepts.” The neural theory therefore offers a coher- ent set of explanations for why there should be conceptual metaphors in the ﬁrst place, how metaphorical inferences work, how metaphors differ from blends, and how pri- mary and complex metaphors contribute to our understanding of abstract concepts and the meanings of words, complex expressions, and grammatical constructions. Metaphor scholars need not conduct neural compu- tational work themselves, and Lakoff offers insights on how to apply the broad scope of the neural theory to address fundamen- tal issues on metaphorical thought and lan- guage. Mark Johnson’s chapter describes the importance of metaphor for the study of phi- losophy (“Philosophy’s Debt to Metaphor”). Not only is metaphor a topic that has long interested philosophers, but philoso- phers use the same conceptual resources of metaphor as do any human being, often without any awareness, and indeed outright rejection, of the fact that they are doing so. Johnson shows how perennial questions in philosophy – What is mind and how does it work? What does it mean to be a person? What is the nature of reality? Is there such a thing as free will? What things or actions are morally good? – are all dependent on metaphor for their answers. Philosophical reasoning and theories often rest on a foundation of simple and complex metaphors. Johnson concludes that giving proper acknowledgment to metaphor, and metaphoric thinking, is essential to future progress in philosophy. Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner’s chapter outlines recent theoretical advances on metaphor within conceptual blending theory (“Rethinking Metaphor”). Through a detailed analysis of the TIME IS SPACE metaphor, they demonstrate how metaphor interpretation requires elaborate integration networks and various techniques for build- ing particular networks such as cobbling and sampling, compression, emergent struc- ture, and overarching goals. These perma- nent features of cognition are not spe- cial to metaphor but can give rise to counterfactuals, analogies, categorizations, and metonymies. Nonetheless, the general framework of conceptual blending theory is capable of explicating various complexities of metaphorical thought and meaning that are difﬁcult to describe within more tradi- tional theories. Sam Glucksberg’s chapter describes empirical research in favor of the idea that metaphors are comprehended through both categorization and comparison processes (“How Metaphors Create Categories – Quickly”). He ﬁrst rejects the traditional assumptions that literal meanings are neces- sarily processed either before or in parallel to nonliteral meanings given experimental ﬁndings that when available, metaphorical meanings are automatically determined. Glucksberg then considers the idea that metaphors are understood entirely by\nMETAPHOR AND THOUGHT 7 comparison processes but claims instead that both literal and ﬁgurative comparison statements, including some similes, can be understood as implicit categorizations. Metaphors and similes are not identical because these two forms often commu- nicate very different meanings for the same topic and vehicle terms. From this evidence, Glucksberg concludes that both categorization and comparison processes are used in metaphor and simile understanding, with apt metaphors working best as catego- rizations because the vehicle concept is an ideal example of the category it represents. Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson out- line their “relevance theory” perspective on metaphor in their chapter (“A Deﬂationary Account of Metaphors”). Under this view, speaking metaphorically is an example of “loose talk” that often is the best way to achieve optimal relevance. Even though ver- bal metaphors do not represent a completely accurate state of affairs, listeners are able to infer efﬁciently the appropriate contex- tual meanings of metaphors by creating ad hoc concepts following the principle of opti- mal relevance. Ad hoc concept construction is a process that is typical of metaphori- cal interpretations, but it is not exclusive to metaphors. In general, relevance theory maintains that metaphors are nothing spe- cial in terms of their processing, even if metaphors often convey special cognitive effects or meanings not easily communicated by more direct speech. Metaphor Understanding The second group of chapters presents var- ious theories of how metaphors are under- stood based on different computational, behavioral, and neuroscience research. Dedre Gentner and Brian Bowdle argue in their chapter that metaphors and similes are understood with processes of similarity and analogy (“Metaphor as Structure-Mapping”). They describe how processes of structural alignment, inference projection, progressive abstraction, and re-representation of different domains are critical to immediate processing of both metaphors and similes. Moreover, widespread conceptual metaphors may be best characterized as extended structure- mappings between domains. Gentner and Bowdle then present their “career of metaphor” theory which claims that metaphors and similes typically evolve from being understood as novel compar- ison statements to being interpreted as category-inclusion statements in which the vehicle terms serve as the best instances of ad hoc categories. The “career of metaphor” hypothesis aims to offer a uniﬁed framework for understanding metaphor, analogy, and similarity. Walter Kintsch’s chapter offers a compu- tational theory of metaphor understanding based on the technique of “latent seman- tic analysis,” or LSA (“How the Mind Com- putes the Meaning of Metaphor: A Simula- tion Based on Latent Semantic Analysis”). LSA operationalizes meaning in terms of high-dimensional semantic space, measured in terms of word co-occurrence, irrespective of their symbolic relationships, and is based on a corpus of 11 million words. Word senses within LSA are not ﬁxed but emergent from both the context-free vector that represents a word in LSA space and the context in which a word is used. This model allows Kintsch to predict the metaphorical or literal meanings of various noun-is-a-noun phrases that accord with human participants’ inter- pretations and aptness judgments. Simple metaphorical and literal language is there- fore not understood by different processes as both can be comprehended by a model of human knowledge based on how word meanings are represented that is objective and comprehensive. Rachel Giora’s chapter explores psy- cholinguistic studies on whether people engage in different psychological processes understanding literal and nonliteral language use (“Is Metaphor Unique?”). Her discus- sion analyzes various theoretical models of ﬁgurative language interpretation, with spe- cial attention to metaphor, which make dif- ferent predictions on both the early pro- cesses and late products of understanding.\n8 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR. Giora forcefully argues that metaphor does not require distinct psychological processes to understand but that the salience of an utterance’s meaning primarily determines the speed with which it is understood, not whether it is literal or ﬁgurative. She goes on to suggest how the salient–nonsalient con- tinuum accounts for many empirical ﬁndings in the experimental literature not explain- able by alternative theories and provides insights into the aesthetic appreciation of poetic metaphor. Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., and Teenie Mat- lock’s chapter argues that part of our abil- ity to make sense of metaphorical language, both individual utterances and extended nar- ratives, resides in the automatic construc- tion of a simulation, whereby we imag- ine performing the bodily actions referred to in the language (“Metaphor, Imagina- tion, and Simulation: Psycholinguistic Evi- dence”). They describe empirical evidence from cognitive science showing the impor- tance of embodied simulations in differ- ent cognitive activities and discuss very recent ﬁndings from psycholinguistics on metaphoric language interpretation that is consistent with the idea that our bod- ily imaginations are actively recruited in metaphor use. This process of building a sim- ulation, one that is fundamentally embodied in being constrained by past and present bod- ily experiences, has speciﬁc consequences for how verbal metaphors are understood and how cognitive scientists, more generally, characterize the nature of metaphorical lan- guage and thought. Seana Coulson reviews the major empir- ical ﬁndings on the neurological substrate of metaphor comprehension (“Metaphor Comprehension and the Brain”). Her discus- sion suggests that too much of this research assumes metaphor to be a homogenous cat- egory (e.g., metaphor and idioms are often grouped together), and that, somewhat surprisingly, there has been no empirical study of the effect of conceptual metaphors on the neurological processes involved in metaphoric language understanding. Coul- son urges scientists to not simply seek the neural substrates of metaphor in tra- ditional language areas of the brain. Much recent research and theory points to how metaphor relies on interactions between auditory, visual, kinesthetic areas of the brain, and the entire human body in the physical–cultural world more generally. Metaphor in Language and Culture The third group of chapters examines the prominence and functions of metaphor in different contexts, including different lan- guages and cultures. Lynne Cameron explores the ways that metaphor shapes, and is shaped by, ongo- ing talk (“Metaphor and Talk”). Her anal- ysis reveals that metaphors are sporadic in discourse, sometimes appearing in thick clusters and sometimes absent altogether. Cameron discusses some of the ways that metaphor is signaled in talk and allows conversational participants to manage their interactions and come to joint understand- ings of various ideas, while in other instances, people’s talk suggests their entirely differ- ent metaphoric understandings of ideas and events. She also strongly argues that claims about conceptual metaphor are too often divorced from real language use, and that each individual may have different versions of conceptual metaphors given their respec- tive culturally contextualized experiences and interactions. Graham Low’s chapter considers the impact of metaphor on teaching and learn- ing, as well as on concepts of educational change (“Metaphor and Education”). He criticizes some notable past theories of edu- cational concepts and processes, such as the idea of “generative metaphor,” for failing to empirically demonstrate that people actu- ally conceptualize situations in metaphoric, as opposed to metonymic, terms. Theoret- ical proposals about metaphor in educa- tion must not, therefore, be made apart from rigorous empirical analyses that are sensitive to context-sensitive differences between metaphor and metonymy. Low then examines the role of metaphor in foreign-language teaching and raises some\nMETAPHOR AND THOUGHT 9 critical questions about the indiscrimi- nate application of cognitive theories of metaphor to classroom situations. He urges that educators pay greater attention to how metaphor is used at a discourse, and not just vocabulary, level, and that more discussion should be given to exactly what teachers want students to learn through their expo- sure to metaphor. Elena Semino and Gerard Steen con- sider in their chapter the ubiquity and func- tions of metaphor in literature (“Metaphor in Literature”). They note the paradox of metaphor in literature being both contin- uous and discontinuous with metaphorical language use in non-literary contexts. On the one hand, many literary metaphors are based in common metaphorical schemes of thought seen in non-literary discourse (e.g., political speeches and scientiﬁc writings), while, on the other hand, some literary metaphors are unique to their speciﬁc con- texts in both form and functions. Semino and Steen explain how both points of view have validity and that understanding the distribu- tion, function, and effects of metaphor in literature will require supplementary infor- mation from both corpus-linguistic and psy- cholinguistic studies. Ning Yu describes how metaphor emerges from the interaction between body and cul- ture in his chapter (“Metaphor from Body and Culture”). He provides a detailed anal- ysis of body-part terms for “face” in Chi- nese and English to show how metaphors are typically grounded in bodily experiences that are shaped by cultural understandings. Yu also shows how a decompositional analy- sis based on the distinction between primary and complex metaphors allows us to deter- mine which aspects of metaphor are bod- ily or culturally based. Primary metaphors, derived from bodily experience, are likely to be widespread and universal, while com- plex metaphors, based on basic metaphoric and metonymic mappings and cultural beliefs, are likely to be more culturally speciﬁc. Josef Stern’s chapter considers whether and how a semantic theory can account for the meanings of metaphors (“Metaphor, Semantics, and Context”). Stern responds to two skeptical challenges to a semantic theory of metaphor regarding the differ- ence between what words literally mean and can be used to say and the context- dependence of metaphorical meaning. He advances a semantic theory that elabo- rates how metaphor depends on the literal and how context has different roles in the communication of metaphorical meaning. More generally, Stern offers a philosophical account of how the semantic structures of metaphor help us understand its cognitive signiﬁcance beyond its propositional content in context. Alice Deignan introduces the important advances on metaphor in corpus research (“Corpus Linguistics and Metaphor”). She presents detailed analyses showing how many classic cases of both linguistic and con- ceptual metaphor, often arising from con- sideration of single texts or analysts’ own intuitions, are not exhibited in the same patterns when viewed from the perspective of large corpora studies. In some instances, data from experimental psycholinguistics on metaphor understanding may not accurately reﬂect what people ordinarily do because the metaphors studied do not follow typical col- locational and syntactic patterns. Deignan argues that metaphor scholars must there- fore be more sensitive to naturalistic lan- guage patterns in constructing experimental tests and broader theories of metaphor and suggests ways that corpora linguistics can aid researchers in achieving this goal. Yeshayahu Shen describes the relation of metaphor to several other poetic ﬁg- ures, notably, simile, zeugma, and synaes- thetic metaphors, in his chapter (“Metaphor and Poetic Figures”). He aims to answer the difﬁcult question – how can many novel ﬁgurative expressions whose meanings are difﬁcult to describe often be so easy to understand? Shen argues that the cognitive “directionality” principle (i.e., metaphorical source domains tend to represent concep- tually more accessible, concrete, and salient concepts than do target domains) accounts for various empirical ﬁndings on the distri- bution and comprehension of poetic ﬁgures.\n10 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR. This work complements research on con- ceptual metaphor theory and experimen- tal psycholinguistic studies of ﬁgurative lan- guage by demonstrating how the meanings and systematicity of many novel, poetic ﬁg- ures arise from the interaction of different linguistic conventions and fundamental cog- nitive principles. Metaphor in Reasoning and Feeling The fourth section of chapters highlights the role of metaphor in different forms of rea- soning and in human feeling and expression. John A. Barnden’s chapter offers an overview of why metaphor is central to many applications of work in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) (“Metaphor and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Why They Matter to Each Other”). He argues that metaphorical map- pings can best be described in computa- tional terms that concretely outline what gets mapped, the effects these mappings achieve, and how to avoid unwanted side effects of these mappings. Moreover, AI work shows the importance of reasoning about beliefs and uncertainty in metaphor- ical thinking and verbal metaphor interpre- tation, and how metaphor is integrated with metonymy in much inferential understand- ing. AI provides an excellent set of tools for doing metaphor research that requires schol- ars to be explicit about underlying mech- anisms of thought and language central to metaphor theory. Rafael N´u˜nez’s chapter presents the case for an embodied, metaphorical understand- ing of many mathematical concepts (“Con- ceptual Metaphor, Human Cognition, and the Nature of Mathematics”). He offers an analysis of how various mathematical ideas are described in terms of metaphorical lan- guage and argues that such talks reﬂect metaphorically alive structuring of abstract concepts and thus are not dead metaphors. N´u˜nez goes on to show how metaphoric gestures employed when people talk about mathematics provides important evidence on the psychological reality of metaphorical mathematics. Overall, mathematics arises naturally from the interactions of our brains, bodies, and experiences with the world, and conceptual metaphor has a big part in the creation and maintaining of abstract mathe- matical ideas. Steven L. Winter’s chapter (“What Is the ‘Color’ of Law?”) presents an in-depth anal- ysis of the metaphor “color of law” (i.e., referring to ofﬁcial misconduct or the way the trappings of ofﬁce provide individuals with the power and prestige of the state) to show how both historical and contem- porary legal theory is guided by metaphoric conceptualizations. Contrary to the widely held belief in legal circles that metaphors are to be avoided, with legal reasoning being best served by ideas that are propositional and deﬁned by necessary and sufﬁcient cri- teria, Winter argues that the cognitive the- ory of metaphor challenges the beliefs that linguistic meaning is arbitrary and a mat- ter of speakers’ self-consciously held inten- tions. Meaning is conﬁgured by embod- ied and social experiences that are framed and constrained by metaphoric processes. Recognition of metaphorical thought, and the methods of conceptual metaphor anal- ysis, demonstrates how legislative statutes express signiﬁcant aspects of our social real- ity that cannot be devalued by reductive approaches to legal reasoning. Zolt´an K¨ovecses’s chapter examines the questions of whether emotion metaphors are unique to emotions and whether emo- tion metaphors are universal (“Metaphor and Emotion”). Based on detailed, cross- linguistic analyses, he claims that emotion metaphors primarily arise from the generic- level metaphor CAUSES ARE FORCES, and that certain speciﬁc source domains (e.g., OPPONENT, NATURAL FORCE, HEAT), apply to a wide range of target concepts other than emotion. Furthermore, even though many emotion metaphors are grounded in uni- versal bodily experiences, there is signiﬁ- cant cultural framing of these experiences that lead to variation in the kinds of source domains in emotion metaphors across differ- ent cultures. Linda M. McMullen writes on the role that metaphor plays in psychotherapy\nMETAPHOR AND THOUGHT 11 (“Putting It in Context: Metaphor and Psy- chotherapy”). She argues that most claims about the effect of metaphorical language in psychotherapeutic outcomes ignore the con- textualized nature of metaphor in client and therapist talk. Isolating speciﬁc metaphors for analysis has made metaphor seem too powerful in some cases and benign in other situations. McMullen calls for empiri- cal investigations of metaphor that properly acknowledge the conversational exchanges and cultural contexts in which they are part. Only by putting metaphor in context can we fully understand what metaphors do for us in psychotherapy and other situations. Antal F. Borbely’s chapter describes the importance of metaphor in the concepts and practice of psychoanalysis (“Metaphor and Psychoanalysis”). Although psychoanalysts have long debated the role of metaphor in psychoanalysis, Borbely offers a new under- standing of metaphor and its interaction with metonymy within psychoanalysis by situating his overview in terms of contempo- rary advances in metaphor research over the past two decades. By demonstrating how key psychodynamic concepts such as trauma, defense, transference, and interpretation are grounded in fundamental metaphoric and metonymic principles, this chapter provides for new links between psychoanalysis and research from cognitive science. Cristina Cacciari’s chapter addresses the topic of synaesthetic metaphor, where it comes from, and how it is understood (“Crossing the Senses in Metaphorical Language”). She argues that perceptually based metaphorical expressions (e.g., “cold silence”) are grounded in the structure of perceptual experiences and the human sen- sory system. Contemporary research in cog- nitive and neuropsychology lends support to this idea, with most people being able to use synaesthetic metaphors quite easily. How- ever, some individuals have special abilities to create and exploit cross-sensory mappings (i.e., blending sounds with colors), which also provide extraordinary evidence for how sensory experiences, supported by neural mechanisms, are fundamental to metaphor- ical mappings in thought and language. Metaphor in Nonverbal Expression The ﬁnal section describes several impor- tant research trends on metaphor in different forms of nonverbal expression. John M. Kennedy’s chapter discusses how metaphor, and other related tropes, can be realized in art objects, such as paint- ings (“Metaphor and Art”). He ﬁrst notes that metaphors are abundant in art with metaphoric pictures often playing on the activity of picturing as a way of using a pictorial device to make a point about the topic. Metaphoric pictures are especially notable because, as Kennedy claims, the mind does not use images that most directly illustrate the thought. Kennedy introduces some contrasts between verbal and pic- torial metaphors, describing, for example, how some successful verbal metaphors can make poor pictorial ones and vice versa. This chapter generally celebrates the per- ceptual nature of metaphoric thought and the ways that art allows people to play with metaphoric possibilities. Charles Forceville’s chapter discusses the meanings and functions of metaphor in pictures and other multimodal forums (“Metaphor in Pictures and Multimodal Representations”). He describes how metaphors in pictures, advertisements, and ﬁlms share many of the same qualities observed in linguistic metaphor, including how conceptual metaphors appear to motivate many aspects of nonlinguistic metaphor. However, the study of pictorial and multimodal metaphor also raises impor- tant questions about the identiﬁcation of source and target domains in all metaphor- ical mappings. Forceville aptly considers some of the communicative purposes of multimodal metaphors and suggests they may have more emotional impact than linguistic metaphors, and aid both local and global narrative coherence, even in cases where the creator of a picture or ﬁlm, for instance, did not consciously intend these metaphors to be understood as such. Alan Cienki and Cornelia M¨uller argue in their chapter that gestures offer impor- tant insights into the metaphorical nature\n12 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR. of language, thought, and cultural ideas (“Metaphor, Gesture, and Thought”). They describe a variety of linguistic, psychologi- cal, and anthropological evidence showing how detailed analyses of gesture offer sup- port for the claim that metaphor is a general, pervasive cognitive principle, and that many metaphoric mappings, such as those evi- dent in metaphoric gestures, are processed online during face-to-face talk. Cienki and M¨uller discuss some methodological issues related to studying metaphoric gestures in naturalistic settings, including the problem of correctly identifying and labeling under- lying conceptual metaphors. Their chapter emphasizes that metaphor is best conceived of as a cognitive activity that occurs online in the process of speaking and is therefore clearly an example of dynamic embodied cognition. Lawrence M. Zbikowski’s chapter pro- vides a historical and conceptual survey of metaphor and music (“Metaphor and Music”). He argues that music is a manifesta- tion of human cognitive capacities and tied to other aspects of human experience, such as the expression of emotion. Through his analysis of various musical compositions, Zbikowski proposes that even if music and language have different cultural functions, they both rely on embodied image- schematic structures for the expression of meaning. Musical events correlate with bod- ily experiences associated with many other modalities, such as vision, taste, and propri- oception. In general, this chapter illustrates how the study of music, as a distinct nonlin- guistic medium, provides important insights into metaphorical thinking processes. The Future The state of the art in metaphor studies is a rich, colorful mosaic of ideas and research activities. Predicting the future of metaphor studies is clearly a risky business given the tremendous diversity of work now being done and as evidenced in this collection. But there are several themes that are touched on in this volume which are likely to become of even greater interest as topics of discussion and debate in the future. Let me brieﬂy men- tion a few of these and their implications for metaphor research. One issue that often arises in infor- mal discussions of metaphor studies has to do with the reliability and generality of individual scholars’ analyses of metaphor. First, how representative are particular iso- lated examples of verbal metaphor, for instance, of the ways people ordinarily speak of the topic/concept? Second, how reli- able are analyses of individual linguistic metaphors in terms of whether they are really metaphoric as opposed to metonymic, for instance? Third, exactly how did an analyst of metaphor draw the inference that a particular pattern of metaphorical thought exists from the examination of sev- eral or many instances of individual verbal metaphors? Scholars’ intuitions are clearly relevant for making claims about the nature of metaphor, what it means, and how they are possibly understood. But some metaphor scholars express concern about the variabil- ity of analysts’ intuitions in making judg- ments about linguistic and even nonlin- guistic (e.g., gesture, music, art) matters. Many metaphor scholars now seek to estab- lish more objective criteria for determin- ing instances of metaphor and for drawing links between patterns of metaphoric lan- guage use and metaphorical thought. Estab- lishing reliable, and replicable, criteria for identifying metaphor in behavior and for drawing links between metaphorical lan- guage/behavior and metaphorical thought is likely to be a major focus of concern in future metaphor studies. A related emerging concern for empir- ical studies of metaphor focuses on the true frequency of metaphors in language and other media. Claims about the impor- tance or ubiquity of particular metaphori- cal patterns, in either language or thought, are often made without adequate empiri- cal support, such as reporting the frequen- cies with which different metaphors are found in particular texts, or comparing the ﬁndings from one’s own textual analysis of metaphor with those seen in large corpora.\nMETAPHOR AND THOUGHT 13 In general, there is likely to be a heightened interest in methodological questions for deﬁning the existence of metaphor in lan- guage and thought. My hunch is that reso- lutions to some of the theoretical debates about metaphor and thought will partly depend on the way scholars respond to these methodological concerns. Finally, the chapters in this handbook speak loudly about the problems associ- ated with making claims about the exis- tence of metaphor in brains, minds, and culture from the analysis of metaphoric language. Does the analysis of metaphoric language, gesture, or artwork indicate that some metaphorical schemes of thought exist within idealized speaker-hearers, the con- scious minds of real speakers, or the subper- sonal unconscious minds, even their brains, of people as they speak, gesture, and create artworks? To what extent does the existence of a particular metaphorical way of think- ing necessarily relate to brains, minds, and cultures? As mentioned earlier, many arti- cles in this volume acknowledge the impor- tance of brains, minds, language, and cul- ture in both enduring and novel patterns of metaphorical thought. But teasing apart these various inﬂuences, and seeing more precisely how they interact, is likely to be a major theme of future metaphor research. Once more, much attention must be given to the exact methods metaphor scholars employ to analyze public manifestations of metaphor and infer patterns of metaphorical thought. We now know enough to feel con- ﬁdent in asserting that metaphor is a major player in human cognition, communication, and culture. But a future challenge for all metaphor scholars is to have greater clarity about what kinds of empirical evidence is needed, and how it is to be obtained and analyzed, to properly characterize the reach and limits of the metaphorical mind.\n\nPart II THE ROOTS OF METAPHOR \u0002\n\nC H A P T E R 1 The Neural Theory of Metaphor George Lakoff The neural revolution is changing our under- standing of the brain and the mind in radi- cal ways, and that is no less true in the the- ory of metaphor. It is more than 27 years since Mark Johnson and I wrote Metaphors We Live By in 1979. Though the fundamen- tal outlines of what we discovered remain as valid today as they were then, develop- ments in brain science and neural compu- tation have vastly enriched our understand- ing of how conceptual metaphor works. This is an intermediate report, as of November 2006. You may well ask why anyone inter- ested in metaphor should care about the brain and neural computation. The reason is that what we have learned about the brain explains an awful lot about the properties of metaphor. For example, have you ever asked why conceptual metaphor exists at all, why we should think metaphorically, why metaphors should take the form of cross- domain mappings? Have you thought about how our metaphor system is grounded in experience or about why certain conceptual metaphors are widespread around the world or even universal? Have you wondered about how complex poetic metaphors are built up out of simpler metaphors? Have you won- dered about how whole systems of philo- sophical or mathematical thought can be built up out of conceptual metaphors? The neural theory explains all this. It explains more as well: Why metaphori- cal language should take no longer to process than nonmetaphorical language. Why some sentences of the form X is Y, make sense as metaphors and why others fail. How con- ceptual metaphors can play a role in abstract concepts. These and other wondrous prop- erties of conceptual metaphors fall out once one considers metaphor theory from the per- spective of the brain. In 1988, Jerome Feldman came to the University of California, Berkeley, as direc- tor of the International Computer Science Institute, and he and I formed the NTL (Neural Theory of Language) group. Feld- man is one of the founders of the the- ory of neural computation, and we have been working together since then. Feldman’s landmark book From Molecules to Metaphors surveys much of the work of our group, and is a must-read for metaphor theorists. As a 17\n18 GEORGE LAKOFF background both to reading that book and to our discussion of metaphor, I offer a brief and overly simple introduction to NTL. A Brief Introduction to NTL Every action our body performs is controlled by our brains, and every input from the external world is made sense of by our brains. We think with our brains. There is no other choice. Thought is physical. Ideas and the concepts that make them up are physically “computed” by brain structures. Reasoning is the activation of certain neuronal groups in the brain given prior activation of other neuronal groups. Everything we know, we know by virtue of our brains. Our physical brains make possible our concepts and ideas; everything we can possibly think is made possible and greatly limited by the nature of our brains. There is still a great deal to be learned about how the brain computes the mind. NTL combines what is known sci- entiﬁcally with linking hypotheses based on neural computation. The Shaping of the Brain We are born with an enormously complex brain with hundreds of precisely and beau- tifully structured regions and highly spe- ciﬁc connectivity from every region to many other regions. Each neuron has connections to between 1,000 and 10,000 other neurons. Between birth and age ﬁve, roughly half of the neural connections we are born with die off. The ones that are used stay; the others die. That is how the brain is shaped, and such a shap- ing is necessary if the brain is to learn to do the huge number of things it does. The ﬂow of neural activity is a ﬂow of ions that occurs across synapses – tiny gaps between neurons. Those synapses where there is a lot of activity are “strengthened” – both the transmitting and receiving side of active synapses become more efﬁcient. Flow across the synapses is relatively slow compared to the speed of computers: about ﬁve one-thousandths of a second (5 millisec- onds) per synapse. A word recognition task – Is the following word a word of English? – takes about half a second (500 milliseconds). This means that word recognition must be done in about 100 sequential steps. Since so much goes into word recognition, it is clear that much of the brain’s processing must be in parallel, not in sequence. This timing result also shows that well-learned tasks are carried out by direct connections. There is no intervening mentalese. Neuronal Groups Jerome Feldman and colleagues, in the 1970s, developed an account of “structured con- nectionism” – not PDP connectionism! In PDP connectionism, all computation is dis- tributed over an entire network and nothing is “localized”; that is, no meaning for func- tion can be assigned to any single neuron or any small collection of neurons in the net- work. Only very restricted parts of the brain work that way. On the other hand, structured connec- tionism takes into account the local struc- ture that exists in the brain. Neuronal groups (of size, say, between, 10 and 100 neurons) are modeled as “nodes” which are meaning- ful and which enter into neural computa- tion. Since each neuron can have between 1,000 and 10,000 neural connections, nodes can “overlap.” That is, the same neuron can be functioning in different neuronal groups, or “nodes.” The ﬁring of that neuron con- tributes to the activation of each node it is functioning in. Though single neurons either ﬁre or not, neuronal groups contain neurons that ﬁre at different times, making the group active to a degree, depending on the propor- tion ﬁring at a given time. The modeling of neural computation is done over networks with nodes, connec- tions, degrees of synaptic strength, and time lapses at synapses. Embodiment and Simulation Semantics The link between body and brain is central to the concept of semantics-as-simulation in NTL. Suppose you imagine, remember,\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 19 or dream of performing certain movements. Many of the same neurons are ﬁring as when you actually perform that movement. And suppose you imagine, remember, or dream of seeing or hearing something. Many of the same neurons are ﬁring as when you actually see or hear that thing. Mirror neurons occur in ﬁber bundles connecting premotor/SMA cortex (which choreographs actions) with the parietal cor- tex (which integrates perceptions). The same mirror neurons ﬁre when you perform an action or you see someone else perform- ing that action. The mirror neurons are thus “multimodal”; that is, they are active not only when acting or perceiving the same action but also when imagining that you are perceiving or performing an action. Now a word like “grasp,” applies both to perform- ing and perceiving grasping; that is, it is multimodal. Simulation semantics is based on a sim- ple observation of Feldman’s: if you can- not imagine someone picking up a glass, you can’t understand the meaning of “Someone picked up a glass.” Feldman argues that, for meanings of physical concepts, meaning is mental simulation, that is, the activation of the neurons needed to imagine perceiving or performing an action. One thing we know is that not all imagination or memory is con- scious, and so not all mental simulations are. That is why we typically have no conscious awareness of most such simulations. A meaningful node is a node that when activated results in the activation of a whole neural simulation and when inhib- ited inhibits that simulation. Inferences occur when the activation of one meaningful node or more results in the activation of another meaningful node. NTL, following the theory of simulation semantics, suggests that the neural circuitry characterizing the meaning of “grasp” is the neural circuitry in the mirror neurons that are activated when imagining either per- forming or perceiving grasping. The meaning of concrete concepts is directly embodied in this manner. There is now considerable evidence that perceiving language activates corresponding motor or perceptual areas. For example, He kicked the ball activates the foot area of the primary motor cortex. Activation and Inhibition A ﬂow of ions across a synapse may either contribute to the ﬁring of the postsynaptic neuron or may help to inhibit such ﬁring, depending on whether the charges of the ions are positive or negative. The activation of neural simulations constitutes meaningful thought. We obviously don’t think all possible thoughts at once. Indeed, most possible thoughts are either unactivated or positively inhibited most of the time. Mutual Inhibition Two neuronal groups can be connected so that each inhibits the activation of the other when there is an active ﬂow of ions of the opposite charge. This is called “mutual inhi- bition” This occurs, for example, when there are two inconsistent, but equally available, ways of looking at a situation. This is common in politics, where a strict conservative worldview is typically inconsis- tent with a nurturant progressive worldview. That is, they are mutually inhibitory. But many people have both worldviews active in different areas of their lives and can think of a given situation ﬁrst from one worldview and then from the other. When one is acti- vated, the other is inhibited. Spreading Activation: Neurons That Fire Together Wire Together Spreading activation at the behavioral level has been the mainstay of psycholinguistics for decades – NTL models link this behav- ior to neural structure. When two neuronal groups, A and B, ﬁre at the same time, activa- tion spreads outward along the network links connecting them, which we experience as a chain of thought. During learning, spreading activation strengthens synapses along the way. When the activation spreading from A meets the\n20 GEORGE LAKOFF activation spreading from B, a link is formed, and the link gets stronger the more A and B ﬁre together. This is a basic mechanism by which the brain is shaped through experi- ence. Neural Maps We are born with neural circuitry that effec- tively activates a “map” of one part of the brain in another part of the brain. For exam- ple, the 100 million neurons coming out of the retina grow connections before birth from the retina to other areas, including the primary visual cortex at the back of the brain. These connections form a “topo- graphic map” of the retina in V1. That is, the connections preserve topology (relative nearness), though not absolute orientation or absolute distance. When neurons next to each other coming from the retina ﬁre, the corresponding neurons ﬁre in V1 and are next to each other in V1. Len Talmy (2000) has observed that spa- tial relations in human languages preserve topology as well. For example, contain- ers remain containers no matter how their boundaries are stretched or contracted, and paths remain paths, no matter how they wind around. Terry Regier (1997) has con- structed computational neural models of topographical maps of the visual ﬁeld that can compute image-schemas with topologi- cal properties and accurately learn the words for a nontrivial range of spatial relations in a variety of languages. Neural Binding Imagine a blue square. We know that color and shape are not computed in the same place in the brain: they are com- puted in quite different areas. Yet the blue square appears to us as a single whole, not as separate squareness and blueness. The name given to this phenomenon is “neural binding.” Neural binding is responsible for two or more different conceptual or per- ceptual entities being considered a single entity. There are three types of neural bindings: 1. Permanent obligatory bindings, for ex- ample, in your stored mental image of a parrot, the feathers are green. There is a permanent obligatory binding in the neural representation for the par- rot image, between the neuronal groups that characterize feather shapes and those, elsewhere in the brain, that char- acterize the green color. 2. Permanently-ready-but-conditional bindings, like the bindings in the neural structure for an election-night map on which any given state can be either red or blue depending on the outcome of the vote. 3. Nonce bindings that occur on the ﬂy as they happen to arise in context. It is not known just how neural binding oper- ates in the brain. One hypothesis is that neu- ral binding is the synchronous ﬁring of nodes. Lokendra Shastri has modeled the computa- tional structure necessary to carry out bind- ing in such a theory. Neural Choreography In general, the premotor cortex and sup- plementary motor area (SMA) choreograph speciﬁc actions, like grasping. Grasping has a neural structure of its own. There are, in addition, neural connections between the premotor/SMA and the primary motor cor- tex – M1. M1 is laid out topographically according to the neurons as they are con- nected to the body. For example, neurons connected to the hand are in the same region of M1, with neurons connected to the index ﬁnger next to neurons connected to the mid- dle ﬁnger. The whole body is topographically connected to the neurons in M1. Each M1 neuronal group can perform only a simple action, like opening the elbow or pointing the index ﬁnger. To pick up a bottle, those simple M1 actions must be sequenced and choreographed. The pre- motor cortex/SMA does the choreogra- phy, having learned neural circuits that ﬁre in complex sequential patterns. As each\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 21 premotor/SMA neuron ﬁres, a connection to M1 makes the right M1 neurons ﬁre, which in turn moves certain muscle groups in the body. Picking up a bottle is like an exquisite ballet with choreographic instructions being carried by the connections to the neurons in M1, which individually control each little movement. When the bindings are in place, the pre- motor/SMA circuitry + bindings + primary motor circuitry acts seamlessly like a single simple circuit. Circuit Types NTL modeling assumes that, as our neu- ral circuitry is being shaped by experience, certain relatively simple basic types of neu- ral circuits emerge, as follows. The research includes ways in which circuits with these properties can be formed. What is important for the study of thought is not the study of precise neu- ral circuitry but rather the study of the kinds of computations that neural circuitry can carry out. An important topic in the neu- ral theory of language is exactly what kinds of circuit types are necessary for human thought – for frames, image-schemas, con- ceptual metaphor, lexical items, grammati- cal constructions, and so on. Neural bindings play a crucial role, form- ing complex circuits by binding nodes in one circuit type to nodes in another circuit type. The winner-take-all circuit: r Two or more subcircuits, say A and B, with mutually inhibiting connections between them. r When A is ﬁring B cannot ﬁre, and con- versely. Winner take all circuits apply, for example, to high-level “worldview” circuits that make sense in a single way of a wide range of expe- riences – in politics, these might be conserva- tive and progressive worldviews. You might understand a range of experiences using one worldview or the other, but not both at once. A gestalt circuit: r A collection of nodes, say, A, B, C, and D and a “gestalt node” G. r When G is ﬁring, all of A, B, C, and D ﬁre. r When a sufﬁcient set of A, B, C, or D is ﬁring, G ﬁres, which results in all other nodes ﬁring. One especially salient node can be sufﬁcient in some cases, or there can be a threshold and any total activa- tion summed over all the nodes above the threshold results in G ﬁring. r When G is inhibited, at least one of the other nodes is inhibited. Gestalt circuits characterize the structure of frames, where the semantic roles and the scenarios are gestalt elements. In a gestalt, the whole is more than just the sum of its parts. Accordingly, in a gestalt circuit, the whole – G – cannot be inhibited and all of its parts activated. The activation of even some of the salient parts activates the whole, and the activation of the whole activates all the parts. Linking circuit: r Two nodes, A1 and A2, a linking node L, and an activating connection C from A1 to A2. r When A1 and L are ﬁring, A2 is ﬁring. But when A2 is ﬁring, A1 need not be ﬁring. Thus, linking is asymmetric. r When A1 is ﬁring and L is not, the con- nection C is not active. (That is, L “gates” the connection C.) r When A1 and A2 are both ﬁring, L is ﬁring and the connection C is active. Note: A1 can ﬁre without A2 ﬁring (if L is not ﬁring), and A2 can ﬁre independently of A1. Linking circuits are used in metonymy: within a frame F, one semantic role A may “stand for” another B. A metonymy is char- acterized by (1) a linking circuit, with nodes A, B, and X a connection C linking A to B asymmetrically, and a linking node L gating the connection C from A to B, and a context X gating the L and (2) a gestalt consisting of\n22 GEORGE LAKOFF gestalt node G and nodes F, A, B, X, and L. For example, in The ham sandwich wants his check, the frame F is the restaurant frame, the ham sandwich plays the role Dish, his refers to the entity that plays the role Cus- tomer, and L characterizes the metonymic link from the Dish to the Customer, and X is the condition that the waiter/waitress identi- ﬁes the Customer B primarily in terms of the Dish B. Two-way linking circuits: A two-way circuit linking nodes A1 and A2 is composed of two opposite one-way linking circuits, with a gestalt node forming a gestalt of the two linking circuits. r Nodes A1 and A2. Connections C1 and C2. Linking nodes L1 and L2. Gestalt node G. r First linking circuit: From A1 to A2 via connection C1, with linking node L1. r Second linking circuit: From A2 to A1 via connection C2, with linking node L2. r Gestalt circuit: Nodes L1 and L2 with gestalt node G. r When G is activated, both links are acti- vated. When G is inhibited, both links are inhibited. Two-way linking circuits provide the kinds of connectivity used in grammatical con- structions and lexical items, where there is a two-way connection between a lexical meaning and a lexical form. In a two-way linking circuit, a gestalt node plays trafﬁc cop, directing activation and inhibition. Mapping circuit: r Two groups of nodes: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 and A2, B2, C2, D2, E2. r Linking nodes LA, LB, LC, LD, LE in linking circuits that, respectively, link A1 to A2, B1 to B2, and so on. r A gestalt circuit with nodes LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE with M as the gestalt node. r When M is inhibited, the linking circuits are all inhibited. r When M is activated, all the linking cir- cuits from A1 to A2, B1 to B2, and so on are activated. Note: The mapping is asymmetric. Mapping circuits characterize conceptual metaphors. Two-way mapping circuits (maps with two-way linking circuits) characterize the structure of grammatical constructions. Mapping circuits are also used as part of the asymmetric connections across mental spaces. A mental space is a neural simulation S that can be activated by a single gestalt node G with semantic roles A, B, . . . in the simulation. A cross-space map has two mental spaces: G1 consisting of simulation S1 with semantic roles (or referents) A1, B1, . . . , and G2 con- sisting of simulation S2 with semantic roles (or referents) A2, B2, . . . . G1 and G2 are linked by a cross-space con- nection made up of (1) a gestalt node G, con- sisting of a space-builder B, (2) a linking cir- cuit L with a connection C from G1 to G2, and (3) a mapping circuit M mapping seman- tic roles (or referents) A1, B1, . . . in simula- tion S1 to semantic roles (or referents) A2, B2, . . . in simulation S2. For example, take the sentence If Clinton had been president of France, there would have been no scandal over his affair. The mental spaces are G1 = The U.S. during Clinton’s presidency with A1 = Clinton and S1 = his affair in the U.S., and G2 = France at that time, A2 = A Clinton-correlate and S2 = A2 is president of France who has an affair in France with no scandal; L1 is the circuit that links A1 (the real Clinton) with A2 (the Clinton correlate ̸= Clinton). Neural binding may be added to linking in such cases to provide a cross-space identity instead of merely a cross-space correlate. For example, consider If Clinton campaigns for his wife, she will win. Here Clinton in the con- ditional space is the same as Clinton in the reality space. There is not only a Clinton-to- Clinton link deﬁning a cross-space correlate, there is also a binding, making the correlate the same person. In this description, the neural binding is “extra,” in addition to the linking. But the\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 23 binding actually makes the case cognitively simpler in that there are fewer distinct enti- ties to keep track of. Complexity in the for- mal description of circuits can often cor- respond to simplicity in the way the brain works. Extension circuit: r A group of connected nodes, A, B, C, D, and E. r Nodes D′ and E′, which are mutually inhibitory with D and E, respectively. r An extension node, X. r When either D or E is ﬁring, X is not. r When X is ﬁring, both D′ and E′ are ﬁring, and consequently D and E are not. This results in two circuit-alternatives: A, B, C, D, E, not X or A, B, C, D′, E′, X. Extension circuits characterize radial cate- gories (see Lakoff, 1993, case study 3). X-schema circuit: r A gestalt node r State nodes r Action nodes r Connections, both activating and inhibit- ing r Timing nodes X-schemas, or “executing schemas,” do things via bindings that activate other cir- cuits. Every action node is preceded and followed by a state node, with activation spreading from states to actions to states. Timing nodes coordinate the lengths of states and actions (which may be instan- taneous or elongated). Iterated actions are formed by loops from the state following an action to the state preceding the action. Conditional actions are formed by gatings – cases where activations from both nodes A and A′ are needed to activate node B. The gestalt node activates the initial state and the ﬁnal state inhibits the gestalt node. Actions typically have initial and ﬁnal states, initiating and concluding actions, central actions, and may have purposes. A purposive action is one with a desired state. The pur- pose is met if the desired state is active after the central action, and if so, the action is con- cluded. Each action can be neurally bound to the gestalt node of another complex X- schema to produce quite complex actions. X-schemas characterize the structures of states and actions, referred to as “aspect” in linguistics. Aspects can be durative or instantaneous, stative or active, completive or open-ended, iterative or noniterative. When connected to the body via the primary motor cortex, premotor/SMA X- schemas can carry out actions. X-schemas can also deﬁne scenarios within frames or narratives and carry out chains of reason- ing, by sequentially activating mental sim- ulations. Conceptual Blends Conceptual blends are neural bindings across distinct structures. We will discuss this fur- ther later. The point of these characterizations of circuit types is that, in NTL, one has to be explicit about the computational proper- ties of neural circuitry. Any cognitive anal- ysis must be able to be carried out by the brain and by the relatively simple circuit types of this sort, or complex circuits formed by bindings. As we shall see, different men- tal operations require different types of neural circuitry that perform very speciﬁc neural computations. Neural Systems Are Best-Fit Systems It is a common cognitive phenomenon that a fact that ﬁts an overall conceptual organi- zation is remembered better than a fact in isolation or one that contradicts an overall conceptual organization. Ideas make sense when they ﬁt a whole system of ideas. Similarly, a linguistic compound makes sense when it ﬁts into a coherent con- text. Take the classic example of “pumpkin bus” – coined on a school outing. There were two buses and the road home passed a pumpkin patch. One of the buses was designated to stop there for students who wanted to buy a pumpkin. It was called the\n24 GEORGE LAKOFF “pumpkin bus,” and the compound was instantly understandable because it ﬁt the context. Compare two sentences: “Bill drank a soda” and “Bill drank an elephant.” To get the meaning of the sentences, you need to do a mental simulation, in which Bill is drink- ing and a frame is activated in which a soda is bound to the patient role in the frame of drinking, which requires that it be a liquid and consumable, which it is. In “Bill drank an elephant,” again the drink frame requires a consumable liquid. Since an elephant is nei- ther – binding the concept of an elephant to the patient’s role in the drink scenarios runs up against neural inhibition. However, con- text may change things. Elephant is a brand of Danish beer, and so the sentence may refer to Danish drinking experience. Or second, one could imagine a context in which an ele- phant was sacriﬁced by being cut up and put in a blender and liqueﬁed so that one could drink it. What determines “ﬁt”? Maximizing the number of overall neural bindings, includ- ing context and overall knowledge, without contradiction, that is, without encountering any mutual inhibition. A node A ﬁts a complex network B better than complex network B′ if the strength of neural bindings one can create between A and B without mutual inhibition is greater than with B′. Image-Schemas and Cogs Terry Regier (1997) has constructed a neural computational model for how a range of spa- tial relations concepts could be computed by the brain. Narayanan (1997) has constructed a neural computational model of the struc- ture of events, that is, X-schemas. Dodge and Lakoff (2006) have speculated on many of the details involved. Gallese and Lakoff (2005) have shown that certain action cir- cuitry has the structure of frames. They have further speculated that the meanings of grammatical elements and constructions are characterized by “Cogs,” that is, secondary neural structures (e.g., premotor/SMA cor- tex) that bind to structures in primary cortex (e.g., motor and visual). This would explain why grammatical meanings are “abstract” in the sense that they have a very general struc- ture but lack speciﬁc details. We are now ready to discuss how all of this changes old metaphor theory into the neural theory of metaphor: NTM. THE OLD THEORY Metaphors We Live By was written in 1979, before the era of brain science and neu- ral computation (also see Lakoff, 1993). Nonetheless, certain results from that era have stood the test of time: r Metaphors are conceptual mappings; they are part of the conceptual system and not mere linguistic expressions. r There is a huge system of ﬁxed, conven- tional metaphorical mappings. r The system exists physically in our brains. r Certain metaphors are grounded via cor- relations in embodied experience (e.g., More Is Up is grounded via the correla- tion between quantity and verticality – you pour more water in the glass and the level goes up). r Metaphorical mappings are typically across conceptual domains (as in Affection Is Warmth). r Mappings (as in A Competition Is a Race) may also be from a speciﬁc case (a race) to a more general case (a competition). r Mappings operate on source domain frame and image-schema structure. r Via metaphorical mappings, source domain structures (image-schema and frame structures) are used for reasoning about the target domain. Indeed, much of our reasoning makes use of conceptual metaphors. r Metaphorical mappings are partial. r Metaphorical language makes use of con- ceptual metaphors. r Many different linguistic expressions can express some aspect of the same metaphor. r A conceptual metaphor may be used in understanding a word, even if that word is not realized in the source domain of the metaphor.\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 25 r Most conceptual metaphors are part of the cognitive unconscious, and are learned and used automatically without awareness. r Novel metaphorical language makes use of the existing system of conventional metaphors. r We commonly take our conceptual metaphors as deﬁning reality, and live according to them. r Target domain entities and target domain predications can result from metaphors. r Two of the relevant sources of data are generalizations over inference patterns (in the source and target domains) and generalizations over lexical items (that can be used of both source and target domains). These results will be familiar to any student of conceptual metaphor. To those who have read “The Contem- porary Theory of Metaphor,” another result that has stood the test of time will be familiar: r Complex metaphors are made up of simpler metaphors and commonplace frames. For example, Love Is a Journey is composed of such conceptual metaphors as Purposes are Destinations Difﬁculties are Impediments to Motion A Relationship is a Container Intimacy is Closeness plus commonplace literal frame-based knowledge that: A Vehicle is an Instrument for Travel, A Vehicle is a container in which the trav- elers are close together, People are expected to have life goals, Lovers ideally have compatible life goals. These are put together in such a way that: The life goals are destinations; The lovers are travelers trying to reach those destinations; Their relationship is a vehicle such that the lovers are in the relationship They are close; and The relationship (when working) helps them achieve life goals; and The relationship difﬁculties are impedi- ments to motion (e.g., a long, dusty road; being on the rocks or off the track). Such compositional structures were noticed during the 1980s. It was also noticed that such structural composition was accom- plished through “bindings” – identiﬁcations of one element with another. Thus, the life goals of the ideal lovers are “bound” to the life goals that are understood as destinations. A vehicle used for travel is typically a con- tainer, which is bound to the container in the metaphor that A Relationship is A Container. It was also noticed that an optimization principle was at work in forming such com- posite metaphors: r Maximize the overall strength of bind- ings. Destinations occur in a travel frame. There are Travelers in that frame. Given that the Life Goals of the Lovers are bound to the Life Goals understood as Destinations, the opti- mization principle leads to the binding of the Lovers with Life Goals to the Travelers going to Destinations, to yield the metaphor- ical mapping that Lovers Are Travelers. Those bindings make possible certain metaphorical inferences: source domain inferences that are mapped combine with target domain knowledge via binding to pro- duce new inferences: If lovers are “stuck” in relationship, if the relationship isn’t “going anywhere,” then they are not mak- ing progress toward common life goals. If the lovers are “going in different directions,” then they may not be able get to the same destinations, which means metaphorically that their common life goals may be incon- sistent. The NTL perspective provides a very dif- ferent way of thinking about such com- plex metaphors. The “maximize bindings”\n26 GEORGE LAKOFF principle is simply a consequence of the fact that the brain is a best-ﬁt system. Inferences are new activations that arise when bindings occur. We can now explain why the Love Is a Journey metaphor exists, why Lovers should be Travelers, why Relationships are Vehicles, and why the Lovers’ common life goals are Destinations. In a system where Lovers ideally have com- patible Life Goals, and Goals (that is, Pur- poses) are Destinations, then (binding Life Goals and Goals) Lovers ideally have com- patible destinations, which induces (via best ﬁt) the metaphors that Lovers are Travelers and Lovers ideally have compatible Destina- tions. Consider our existing conceptual system where A Relationship is a Container, A Vehi- cle is a Container in which the Travelers are close together, Intimacy is Closeness, Lovers are intimate, A Vehicle is an Instrument for Travel, and Lovers are Travelers. Binding containers to containers, vehicles to vehi- cles, and travelers to travelers and bringing those bindings together with the metaphor- ical mapping that Lovers are Travelers yields (by best ﬁt) A Relationship is a Vehicle that Lovers are in. In short, the Love is a Journey metaphor arises naturally via best ﬁt from the rest of the system. To see the real importance of such an observation, let us look at primary metaphors and how they are acquired. Primary Metaphors The neural theory of metaphor got its real impetus from three Berkeley disserta- tions done in 1997 – by Srini Narayanan, Joe Grady, and Christopher Johnson. Narayanan’s dissertation was key. He mod- eled metaphors as neural mappings and formulated certain metaphors for interna- tional economics. He then showed that the results of source domain inferences from the domain of physical motion and action are mapped onto the international economics target domain, interact with the logic of the target domain, and produce metaphorical inferences. Johnson studied metaphor acquisition in young children and found three stages: (1) source domain only; (2) in domains where the source and target domains were both active (“conﬂated”), children learned to use source domain words with target domain meanings and grammar, then later (3) used the words metaphorically. Putting together the Johnson and Narayanan results yields the following hypothesis: in situations where the source and target domains are both active simul- taneously, the two areas of the brain for the source and target domains will both be active. Via the Hebbian principle that Neurons that ﬁre together wire together, neural mapping circuits linking the two domains will be learned. Those circuits constitute the metaphor. Grady called such metaphors “primary metaphors” and observed that they are learned by the hundreds the same way all over the world because people have the same bodies and basically the same rele- vant environments. Therefore, we will have very much the same experiences in child- hood in which two domains are simulta- neously active, and so we will learn neu- ral metaphorical mappings linking those domains naturally, just by functioning in the world. Just living an everyday life gives you the experience and suitable brain activa- tions to give rise to a huge system of the same primary metaphorical mappings that are learned around the world without any awareness. By best ﬁt, different cultural frames will combine with those primary metaphors and give rise to different metaphor systems. The Love Is a Journey metaphor is a good exam- ple. The primary metaphors that ground the Love Is a Journey metaphor are r Purposes are Destinations: Every day there is a correlation between achieving a purpose and reaching a destination, as when you have to go to the refrigerator to get a piece of fruit or a cold beer. r Difﬁculties are Impediments to Motion: A difﬁculty is something that inhibits your achievement of some purpose,\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 27 which is metaphorically reaching a desti- nation. Hence, difﬁculties are conceptu- alized metaphorically as impediments to motion to a destination. r A Relationship is a Container (a Bounded Region of Space): People who are closely related tend to live, work, or otherwise spend time in the same enclosed space – your family in your home, your co- workers at the ofﬁce, and so on. r Intimacy is Closeness: The people you are most intimate with are typically the people you have spent time physically close to: your family, spouse, lover, and so on. In each case, a correlation in experience is realized in the brain as the co-activation of distinct neural areas, which leads to the for- mation of circuits linking those areas. A Structural Prediction. The neural theory says that complex metaphors that are exten- sions of existing primary metaphors bound together should be easier to learn and under- stand than conceptual metaphors that are totally new – since they just involve new binding and other connecting circuitry over existing conceptual metaphors. They should also seem more natural. Take, for example, the sentence My job is a jail. 1. A jail restricts someone’s freedom of motion to desired external destinations, thus producing frustration and other negative emotions. 2. The metaphors that Achieving a Purpose is Reaching a Destination and Actions are Motions exist in our conceptual system. 3. Binding the restriction on freedom of motion to Actions are Motions, we infer a restriction on freedom of action. 4. Binding desired external destinations to Achieving a Purpose is Reaching a Desti- nation, we infer achieving external pur- poses. 5. My Job is a jail metaphorically infers that my job restricts my freedom of action in achieving external purposes, thus producing frustration and other emotions. Thus, given the existing system, maximiza- tion of binding produces the meaning of the sentence. We predict that this should be easy to understand and to process. Compare this sentence with a sentence like My job is an aardvark. An aardvark is an African animal with a long proboscis that eats ants by sticking its proboscis in anthills. There are no primary metaphors in our normal conceptual systems that provide a natural metaphorical interpretation for this sentence. However, that sentence can be metonymic, say, when said by a zookeeper whose job is taking care of an aardvark. The metonymy is In the Animal Keeper Frame, The Animal stands for The Job of Taking care of that Animal. The neural theory in general predicts that the most immediate component metaphors for a complex metaphor will be activated and used in the mapping. In short, in most cases, new conceptual metaphors that are easy to learn and make sense of are using con- ceptual mappings that preexist, frame-based knowledge that preexists, and adding con- nections in the form of circuitry that binds, links, maps, extends, and forms gestalts. A Processing Prediction. The neural the- ory of metaphor makes an important prediction in the case of conventional con- ceptual metaphorical mappings that are real- ized by ﬁxed brain circuitry. When you hear a metaphorical expression, the literal meanings of the words should activate the source domain circuitry and the context should activate the target domain circuitry, and together they should activate the map- ping circuit. The result is an integrated cir- cuit, with activation of both source and target domains and processing over both at once. Thus, understanding language that makes use of a conventional conceptual metaphor should take no longer than nor- mal frame-based nonmetaphorical process- ing. This result has been shown repeatedly, as in the example, My job is a jail. The neural theory thus contradicts old two-step theories (before conceptual metaphor theory) that claim that the source domain is processed ﬁrst and then the map- ping operates to process the target domain.\n28 GEORGE LAKOFF Time of processing studies contradict this view. Asymmetry. Each neuron ﬁres asymmet- rically, with the ﬂow of ions from the cell body down the axon, spreading out from there. Different neurons have different ﬁring capacities, depending on the receptors at the synapses that regulate ion ﬂow. Those neu- rons that ﬁre more tend to develop greater ﬁring capacities. And those involved in phys- ical bodily functioning tend to ﬁre more. For this reason, the metaphorical maps learned are asymmetric and tend to have physical source domains (though some have social source domains). The literature abounds with obvious examples. r More Is Up: Our bodies are constantly monitoring physical height more than computing abstract quantity. r Affection Is Warmth: Temperature is always there to be monitored; affection isn’t. r Intimacy Is Closeness: We constantly monitor how close we are to objects, more than we judge intimacy. The preponderance of our system of pri- mary metaphors is acquired in childhood, and childhood experience has an impor- tant inﬂuence on the system of primary metaphors that we learn. Consider the fol- lowing important examples: r Governing Institutions are Families: Our ﬁrst experience with being governed is in our family. Thus, the social domain of the family will be used more when the metaphor is learned. r Speech Act Force is Physical Force: Par- ents teach their young children by manip- ulating their bodies as they give directives. Thus, verbal directives are learned as hav- ing a “force.” r Arguments are Struggles: All small chil- dren struggle with their parents when their parents guide them physically in teaching them how to behave. Early ver- bal arguments are commonly about meet- ing behavioral expectations. As we grow up and learn about wars and battles, the source domain of struggle is specialized and expanded to battles and wars. During learning, much of the abstract domain is structured by ﬁxed projections from the embodied domain. When process- ing source domain words in the context of a target domain subject matter, the ﬁxed connections result in co-activation of the two domains. Thus, source domain activa- tions arising from inferences are projected onto the target domain via the preestab- lished mapping. The Use of Conceptual Metaphors The preneural theory of conceptual metaphor was vague on a number of details. Metaphors were cross-domain mappings – from a frame in one domain to another domain, also structured by frames. Such mappings were seen as applied to target domain situations as understood in the context of commonplace information. Inferences were mapped from the source to target situation, with as much as possible frame and image-schema structure “pre- served” from the source domain. Thus, in use, you had: r The metaphorical mapping (from source domain frame to target domain frame). r The speciﬁc situation being discussed, ﬁt- ting the target domain. r Target domain commonplace informa- tion. r Source domain commonplace informa- tion. Metaphorical inferences took (1) source domain inferences, (2) mappings of the results of such inferences to the target domain frames; (3) combining of those mapped inferences with target domain information to give new “metaphorical” inferences. The neural theory of metaphor provides an explanatory mechanism for metaphor- ical inferences that can be modeled pre- cisely (Narayanan, 1997) using neural\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 29 computational modeling. At the heart of the modeling of metaphorical inferences is the notion of mental simulation, which repre- sents speciﬁc situations. Let us look ﬁrst at inferences in NTL, and then at metaphorical inferences. Inferences A meaningful node in a neural circuit is a node that can activate a mental simulation. An inference occurs when: r the activation of a collection of meaning- ful nodes (the antecedent situation) in a neural circuit leads to the activation of one or more other meaningful nodes (the consequence); r when the activation of the antecedent nodes is necessary for the consequence; r and when the inhibition of one or more consequence nodes results in the inhibition of one or more antecedent nodes. Inferences are simply consequences of the meaningfulness of nodes in simulation semantics, the spreading of activation, and best-ﬁt constraints (the consequences ﬁt the antecedents best). Recall that the maximiza- tion of binding is one of the characteristics of the best-ﬁt property of any neural system. In short, maximizing binding can lead to inferences. Metaphorical Inferences A metaphorical inference occurs when: r a metaphorical mapping is activated in a neural circuit, r there is an inference in the source domain of the mapping, r and a consequence of the source domain inference is mapped to the target domain, activating a meaningful node. For example, suppose the sentence is We’re driving in the fast lane on the freeway of love. In the travel domain, driving in the fast lane on the freeway activates the inferences that 1. the vehicle the travelers are in is going a lot faster than usual, 2. the driving is exciting, and 3. it can be dangerous (the travelers can suffer physical harm). “Freeway of love” activates the target domain of love and source domain of travel, result- ing in the activation of the Love Is a Jour- ney metaphorical mapping. The metaphori- cal inferences are that: M1. the relationship the lovers are in is develop- ing a lot faster than usual, M2. the development of the relationship is excit- ing, and M3. it can be dangerous (the lovers can suffer psychological harm). These inferences are activated when the circuitry is activated in the processing of the sentence. The totality of source domain inferences does not have to proceed before any of the target domain inferences. Mapping “Gaps” A mapping gap occurs when there is a metaphorical mapping, but part of the source domain frame has no correlate in the target domain. For example, take the sen- tence I gave Sam that idea. In this metaphor, the communication of an idea is the transfer of an object from the speaker to the hearer. A. Source domain knowledge: the giver loses the object when he gives it to the recipient. B. Target domain knowledge: the speaker does not lose the idea when he gives it to the listener. Because we know (B) about the target domain, no mapping from (A) to (B) can be learned. Thus, what appears to be a “gap” is not a gap; it is just that an impos- sible mapping does not take place in the learning of the metaphor. Recall that the learning of the metaphor involves repeated co-activation of the corresponding source and target nodes, and the absence of such\n30 GEORGE LAKOFF co-activation implies that no such maps are learned. Image-Schema “Preservation” As Regier (1995, 1997) and Dodge and Lakoff (2006) have argued, primitive image- schemas (e.g., container, source-path-goal, degree of closeness, direction, and amount of force) are computed by brain struc- tures that are either innate or form early. Action schemas and frames are structured using such primitive image-schemas. For example, putting in makes use of the con- tainer schema, the source-path-goal schema, a force schema, a direction schema, and an aspectual schema. Metaphorical putting in – as in The Found- ing Fathers put freedom of speech into the Constitution – uses physical putting-in as a source domain. The inference patterns of those schemas as bound together in the source domain are then used in metaphori- cal inferences. For example, if you put some- thing into a physical container, it isn’t there before you put it in and it is there afterward and it remains there until something hap- pens to remove it. That is also true of the freedoms the Founding Fathers put into the Constitution. In preneural theories of conceptual metaphor, we spoke of “preservation” of source domain image-schemas. In the neural theory, it is the use of source domain image- schemas in inferences about target domain situations. Mental Spaces A “mental space” from an NTL perspective is a mental simulation characterizing an under- standing of a situation, real or imagined. The entire space is governed by a gestalt node, which makes the mental space an “entity” which, when activated, activates all the ele- ments of the mental space. Blending What is called “blending” is a matter of neu- ral binding. Consider the monk blend. There are two mental spaces each structured by frames. In each, there is a mountain and a path. On day 1, the monk walks up the path to the top of the mountain, sleeps overnight there, and on day 2, the monk walks down the same path to the bottom Day 1 is one mental space; day 2 is another. The blend consists of bindings and a gestalt circuit. The mountain on day 1 is bound to the mountain on day 2, the path on day 1 to the path on day 2, the monk on day 1 to the monk on day 2. A gestalt node forms a single blend out of the two spaces with the bindings. Question: Is there a single place on the path where the monk is located at the same time on both days? Answer: Yes. Where he meets himself. We have formed a single integrated cir- cuit containing both mental spaces, with two instances of the monk, one going up and the other coming down the mountain. Being on the same path, the up-going monk will “meet” the down-going monk in the simula- tion created by the bindings at some place and time. Note that there is no metaphor here. Metaphors versus Blends A metaphor is a mapping. A blend is an instance of one or more neural bindings. Metaphors don’t occur in isolation nor do bindings. A contextual interpretation of an utterance includes both general knowledge and target domain knowledge. The overall use of metaphor involves some bindings and inferences in the source domain, bindings and inferences in the target domain, acti- vation of metaphoric maps, and the activa- tion of other connected nodes that character- ize related knowledge (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002; Grady et al., 1999). What is called the “blend” is other overall set of bindings in the simulation that characterizes the meaning of the sentence. To see the difference between metaphors and blends, consider the metaphor More Is Up. In a sentence like The temperature went up, we are understanding quantity in terms of verticality. But they are different things. Amount of heat in itself is not vertical.\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 31 But in a thermometer oriented vertically, the mercury goes up physically as the tem- perature increases (metaphorically goes up). The thermometer is an object that, in its very physical construction, is intended to be understood in terms of both a binding and a metaphor. The metaphor, but not the blend, is in the sentence The temperature went up. Thus, metaphors exist separate from blends. Such metaphoric blends are formed when a source and a target element of a metaphor are bound together via neural binding. Let’s consider another contrast. Suppose you are explaining arithmetic to a child. You draw a line. And you say, “Think of a number as being a point on this line. Say this is zero. And to get to one you take a step from 0 to 1, located here on the line. To add 3 to 1 you take three steps from 1, like this, and you get to 4. To subtract 1 from 4, you take a step backward, and you get to 3.” And so on. Here, you are just using the metaphor that numbers are points on a line. It is just a metaphor. No blending. But if you go to the Cartesian plane where you have a number line, then you not only have the metaphor of numbers as points on a line, but you have a binding as well: the num- ber and the point on the line are identical – the same entity! This metaphorical blend is actually in the mathematics of the Cartesian plane. Again, a mere metaphor (understanding the target in terms of the source) is crucially different from that metaphor plus a binding of source entities to target entities. Optimality in Blending A great deal follows from the understand- ing of blending as neural binding, given that neural systems work by spreading activa- tion and best-ﬁt principles. Best-ﬁt princi- ples include the maximization of binding, and the maximal use of conventional frames, metaphors, commonplace knowledge, and context. Maximizing neural binding means a maximal integration of all these elements and “emergent” inferences resulting from the “mixing” of inference-determining elements (e.g., from source and target domains). The result is a set of predictions about blends – exactly the well-known properties of optimal blends: r Integration: The scenario in the blended space should be a well-integrated scene. Each neural binding across conceptual struc- tures serves to “integrate” those conceptual structures. r Web: Tight connections between the blend and the inputs should be main- tained, so that an event in one of the input spaces, for instance, is construed as imply- ing a corresponding event in the blend. Such correspondences are given by maps, either metaphorical maps or maps connect- ing mental spaces (that is, simulations). r Unpacking: It should be easy to recon- struct the inputs and the network of con- nections, given the blend. Neural bindings have the property that they can be “relaxed”; that is, the bound struc- tures can be conceptualized without the binding, as when you can separate off the blueness of a blue square and think of it as red. r Topology: Elements in the blend should participate in the same sorts of relations as their counterparts in the inputs. This follows immediately since a structure with an added neural binding has all the rela- tions as the structure without that neural binding. r Good Reason: If an element appears in the blend, it should have meaning. And if it arises by inference, it will be tied into the logic of the blend. Since blends apply to simulations, and sim- ulations have meaning, this follows immedi- ately. r Metonymic Tightening: Relationships between elements from the same input\n32 GEORGE LAKOFF should become as close as possible within the blend. For instance, western images of personiﬁed Death often depict the ﬁgure as a skeleton, thus closely associating the event of death with an object that, in our more literal understandings, is indirectly but saliently associated with it. These are simply cases of a metonymy plus a neural binding of the source with the target of the metonymy. Thus, all of the optimality properties pro- ducing “good” blends are explained by sim- ulation semantics, spreading activation, and best ﬁt, which governs optimality in biolog- ical neural networks. Emergence Emergence is the occurrence in a blend of an entity or proposition that does not exist in any of the blend “inputs.” Emergence is explained by inference in neural systems. Maps and blends across conceptual struc- tures can give rise to inferences not present in any “input.” Consider the example, In France, Clinton’s affair wouldn’t have mattered. In the blend, Clinton, the American chief executive, is bound to the position of the French chief executive in France. Since the French don’t care about politicians’ sexual liaisons, we get the inference that “In France, Clinton’s affair wouldn’t have mattered.” This “emergent” inference does not occur in either of the inputs: France, where Clinton was not chief executive of France, and the United States, where Clinton’s affair did matter. It arises by neural binding and inference. BETTER ANALYSES WITH METAPHORIC BLENDS Certain classic analyses in the blending lit- erature which are seen as nonmetaphoric blends really should be seen as metaphoric blends. For example, there is a common metaphor in which Breaking a Record Is Winning a Race Against the Previous Record-holder. Thus, a few years ago when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were both attempting to break Babe Ruth’s home run record, the press represented the situation metaphorically as a race with Ruth – and each other. In the daily papers, McGwire and Sosa were represented by how many games they were “behind” or “ahead” of Ruth’s 60 homerun performance. They were spoken of as “catching up” or “falling behind.” The clas- sic blending analysis misses this metaphor. The same metaphor occurred in the situ- ation many years back when the yacht Great America tried to break the San Francisco to Boston record through the Northwest Passage set 100 years before by the yacht Northern Light. Accordingly, the metaphor had the Great America in a “race” with the Northern Light, even though they sailed 100 years apart. The newspapers daily reported how many days “ahead” of the Northern Light the Great America was. Again, the classic blending analysis misses the metaphor. The moral: A neural theory analysis forces us to notice analyses we might otherwise miss. Let’s consider another class of cases with the same moral. There are two widely used metaphors rarely analyzed as such. r A Person who performs actions with cer- tain characteristics is a Member of a Pro- fession known for those characteristics. Here, the mapping is from the frame of a member of a profession, with the charac- teristics that members of a profession are known by. Special cases, for example, a sur- geon frame expands the general frame with the values ﬁlled in one way, while a butcher frame expands the general frame with the values ﬁlled in another way. In each case, the source domain of the metaphor is a stereotype, represented as a frame whose semantic roles include kinds of characteristics. For example, a surgeon is known for being precise with beneﬁcial results, while a butcher is known for being sloppy and acting more with force than with care, with messy results. Thus, we can say r My lawyer presented my case with surgi- cal skill. r My lawyer butchered my case.\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 33 In the ﬁrst, the lawyer was careful and skill- ful, with beneﬁcial results. In the second, the lawyer was careless, sloppy, and heavy- handed, with messy results. Other examples can be quite diverse: r Ichiro slices singles through the inﬁeld like a surgeon. r Frank Thomas hacks at the ball like a butcher. This very general metaphor accounts for the classical examples: r My butcher is a surgeon. r My surgeon was a butcher. The ﬁrst case says the butcher cuts meat with the care of a surgeon, while the second says that my surgeon handled my surgery in a careless, sloppy, and heavy-handed way. A second example like this is the com- monplace metaphor: r A Person with characteristic properties is an Animal known for those properties. Classic cases include Man is a wolf, Our new salesman is a tiger, Harry’s a pig, and You’re trying to weasel out of this. All examples use a stereotype of an animal, and we understand the person in terms of the characteristics of the animal stereotype. There have been attempts to understand such cases nonmetaphorically, just in terms of bindings based on similarity. Such an approach would claim that there is no con- ventional metaphor at all and that all such cases are literal blends based on similar prop- erties. We can see what is wrong with this approach by looking at cases outside the pro- posed conventional metaphors we just dis- cussed. Consider sentences such as r My surgeon is a Russian. r My butcher is a Russian. r My lawyer is a Russian. There are common stereotypes of Rus- sians, say, that they are very sentimental and emotional, sometimes to the point of losing control. If the blending approach were correct, we would expect these sentences to act like The butcher is a surgeon and The surgeon is a butcher. Just as the butcher isn’t literally a surgeon by profession, nor is the surgeon literally a butcher by profession, so you would expect these sentences to be saying that the surgeon, butcher, and lawyer were not literally Russian by nationality; but they do say that. In addition, you would expect them to say that the surgery, butchering, and law practice are carried out in an overly sentimental, emotional, almost out-of-control way. But the sentences do not say that. The “Russian” sentences are literal and work just as you would expect literal sentences to work. The surgeon- butcher sentences are metaphorical, using conventional conceptual metaphors, and they work accordingly. I conclude that the metaphor approach is accurate for cases like the surgeon-butcher and animal examples and the blending approach is not. Blends are real and result from neural bindings, mental spaces, and metaphors. But there is no reason to believe that there is a neural operation of “blending” in addition. THE ROLE OF METAPHOR IN ABSTRACT CONCEPTS In Whose Freedom? I argue that metaphor is central to the core concept of freedom and that this abstract concept is actually grounded in bodily experience. Physical freedom is freedom to move – to go places, to reach for and get objects, and to perform actions. Physical freedom is deﬁned in a frame in which there are potential impediments to freedom to move: blockages, being weighed down, being held back, being imprisoned, lack of energy or other resources, absence of a path provid- ing access, being physically restrained from movement, and so on. Freedom of physical motion occurs when none of these potential impediments is present. Various metaphors turn freedom of physical motion into freedom to achieve one’s goals. The event structure metaphor, for instance, characterizes achieving a purpose as reaching a desired destination, or getting a desired object. Freedom to achieve one’s purposes then becomes, via the event structure metaphor, the absence of any\n34 GEORGE LAKOFF metaphorical impediments to motion. Other ideas, like political freedom and freedom of the will, build on that concept. The concept of political freedom is char- acterized via a network of concepts that necessarily includes the event structure metaphor and the inferences that arise via that metaphor. The ultimate grounding of the concept of political freedom is visceral, arising from the experience of not being free to move and the frustration that engenders. What is the role of metaphor in our con- cept of political freedom? Our understand- ing of conceptual systems in terms of neural systems shows that conceptual metaphor is used in our understanding of political free- dom but indirectly. METAPHOR IN SYSTEMS OF THOUGHT In Philosophy in the Flesh, Mark Johnson and I argue that philosophical systems of thought rest on a relatively small number of metaphors treated as ultimate truths and used constantly in reasoning. The neural the- ory of metaphor allows us to understand more about such systems and people who think in terms of them most of every day. Because the fundamental metaphors are used constantly, the synaptic strengths in the metaphors become very strong and resistant to change. Second, spreading activation and best-ﬁt properties (including maximization of binding) make such systems highly inte- grated, tightly connected, with many infer- ences. As a result, such a system will dom- inate your thought, your understanding of the world, and your actions. One will tend to see the world through the system; one will tend to construct neural simulations to ﬁt the system; one will tend to plan the future using the system; and one will deﬁne common sense through the sys- tem. The system will tend to make experi- ences and facts consistent with it noticeable and important, and experiences and facts inconsistent with it invisible. This is especially true in politics, where progressive and conservative thought are each deﬁned by a central metaphor and a system of thought that ﬁts it (see my Moral Politics). By far the most detailed study of the role of metaphor in a system of thought is Rafael N´u˜nez’s and my book, Where Mathematics Comes From, which shows in great detail how many branches of higher mathemat- ics are built up via layers of metaphor from embodied concepts. METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE The neural theory of language allows us to understand better why language is so pow- erful. Let’s start with words. Every word is deﬁned via linking circuit to an element of a frame – a semantic role. Because every frame is structured by a gestalt circuit, the activa- tion of that frame element results in the acti- vation of the entire frame. Now, the frame will most likely contain one or more image- schemas, a scenario containing other frames, a presupposition containing other frames, may ﬁt into and activate a system of other frames, and each of these frames may be structured by conceptual metaphors. All of those structures could be activated simply by the activation of that one frame element that deﬁnes the meaning of the given word. In addition, the lexical frame may be in the source domain of a metaphor. In that case, the word could also activate that metaphor. In the right context, all of these activated structures can result in inferences. Let’s suppose a word activates a network of frames, images-schemas, and metaphors. The metaphors may be only indirectly linked to the frame directly activated by the word. Is that word an instance of “metaphorical language”? That is not how the term is usu- ally used. We usually speak of metaphorical lan- guage when r the frame element the word designates is in the source domain frame of the given metaphor, r the subject matter under discussion is in the target domain of that metaphor. Thus, up in the sentence Prices went up, acti- vates the verticality frame, prices activates the quantity frame, and together they acti- vate the More is Up metaphor.\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 35 In addition, the word up – by virtue of the metaphorical mapping – acquires a link to the quantity frame, where it activates greater quantity. Does up in Prices went up always acti- vate the More is Up? It depends. In our neural systems, the More is Up metaphor is always present in the neural system, always physically linked to the concept of greater quantity – connected and ready to be acti- vated. But it is possible for the metaphori- cal mapping to be inhibited and for up to be directly activated. However, when a graph of prices physically rises, then the More is Up metaphor is activated, as it is in a sentence like Prices reached a new peak, where reach and peak activate the concept of Motion Upward. Grammar can also play a role in activat- ing a metaphor, as in the expression free- way of love, in which the construction sanc- tions an interpretation in which the head noun freeway comes from the source domain (travel) and object of the preposition love comes from the target domain. Grammat- ical constructions come with metaphorical constraints, as Karen Sullivan has observed. Compare bright student versus *intelligent light: the modiﬁer (bright) is from the source domain, while the head (student) is from the target domain; but the reverse doesn’t work – except in a special class of cases, like emotional intelligence, where the modi- ﬁer is a nonpredicative adjective that deﬁnes a domain (emotion). All this is natural in a neural theory because of the connectivity involved. The form elements (words and grammatical cat- egories) are neurally linked to the elements in conceptual system, where metaphori- cal mappings are linked to frame elements, which are linked to words or grammatical categories. Consider a poetic metaphor like Dylan Thomas’s line, Do not go gently into that good night. The line does not overtly mention death as the subject matter, but the line con- tains three words that each evoke a source domain frame in a metaphor for death: go as in Death is Departure; gently as in Life is a Struggle; and night as in A Lifetime is a Day and Death is Night. This is natural from a neural perspective. Each word activates a frame element in a frame go, gently, night. The three frames are thereby activated and each provides some activation to the corre- sponding metaphors for Death. This is rein- forced by the fact that the sentence does not have a direct literal meaning, in which each of these words is used literally. But the source domain meanings do important work in constructing a metaphorical image of a man moving into the night ready to ﬁght. The next line, Rage, rage against the dying of the light uses dying metaphorically in the sense of light ceasing to exist. But the acti- vation via the metaphor of source domain of death reinforces the interpretation of the ﬁrst line. This use of “activation” makes sense in the neural model. The Use of Metaphoric Language The neural theory of metaphor also makes sense of the use of metaphoric language in context. We know that metaphor does not reside in words but in ideas. This is espe- cially clear from cases of metaphorical ambi- guity, where the same words evoke differ- ent readings using different metaphors. “It’s all downhill from here” may in a given situ- ation meaning “it’s getting easier” (Ease of Action Is Ease of Motion) or “it’s getting worse” (Down is Bad). Either conceptual metaphor can apply to the spatial meaning of “down” in “downhill.” In a neural account, both metaphors are connected to the spatial meaning of “down,” but the metaphors are mutually inhibitory. Only one can be acti- vated, depending on context. Consider a metaphorically ambiguous sentence like “Let’s move the meeting ahead two days.” If uttered on a Wednesday, it could refer to either Monday or Fri- day, depending on which metaphor for time is used – moving-ego or moving-time. Since they are mutually contradictory, the metaphors are mutually inhibitory. The neu- ral theory can explain Lera Boroditsky’s clas- sic experiment at San Francisco airport. She showed that, for people waiting for a plane to come in, the motion of the plane toward\n36 GEORGE LAKOFF them primed the moving time metaphor and they gave the answer “Monday,” two days ahead of the moving time. Those who were on the plane and coming off were primed by being on the moving object, and they gave the answer “Friday,” two days ahead of the moving ego. The neural theory explains the priming in these cases. The two time metaphors are mutually inhibitory. What tips the scales is the priming – the neural activation of either a moving time or moving ego in the spatial domain. What Makes Metaphorical Language Meaningful? Language is meaningful when the ideas it expresses are meaningful. Conceptual metaphors are meaningful when they are grounded. They are grounded, ﬁrst, by source domain embodiment, and second by the embodiment of the source and target domains of the primary metaphors being used. SUMMARY: WHAT DOES THE NEURAL THEORY PROVIDE? The neural theory provides a much better understanding of how thought and language work and of how metaphorical thought ﬁts into the picture. It also provides explanations for a host of phenomena. And it changes how one does metaphor analysis – and redeﬁnes what metaphor analysis is. The neural theory explains: r Why there should be conceptual meta- phor at all; what conceptual metaphors are physically; why we have the primary metaphors we have, how the system is grounded, and why certain conceptual metaphors are widespread around the world. r How metaphorical inferences work; why they should exist; how they operate in context, and how they interact with sim- ulations. r All of the properties of the old metaphor theory, the theory as described by myself and Mark Johnson in Metaphors We Live By and by myself in the essay “The Con- temporary Theory of Metaphor.” r How metaphors can function indirectly in the characterization of abstract concepts. r How a small number of metaphors can organize a whole system of thought and become the principles on which one lives one’s life. r How metaphorical language works as a simple extension of non-metaphorical language. r Why metaphors differ from blends, and why blends do not do the job of meta- phors. The neural theory also clariﬁes what the study of metaphor is about, namely, r showing how metaphorical understand- ing is grounded in basic human experi- ence via primary conceptual metaphors; r showing how primary metaphors con- tribute to complex conceptual meta- phors; r showing how both primary and complex metaphors contribute to the meanings of words, complex expressions, and gram- matical constructions; r showing how conceptual metaphor plays a role in abstract concepts and overall con- ceptual systems (as in politics, philoso- phy, and mathematics); r and, ﬁnally, showing how conceptual metaphors contribute to the understand- ing of language and other uses of symbols. HOW DOES A METAPHOR ANALYST MAKE USE OF ALL THIS? Metaphor analysts rarely know neural com- putation, and they shouldn’t be expected to. The Neural Theory of Language Project has ﬁgured out a way to let linguists be lin- guists and not computer or brain scientists. We have invented a notation that correlates with circuitry with the appropriate compu- tational properties but can be used by ana- lysts without worrying about the compu- tational details. Thus, consider a notation such as:\nTHE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR 37 Metaphor: LoveIsAJourney Source Domain: Journey Target Domain: Love Mapping: Travelers →Lovers Vehicle →Relationship Destinations →LifeGoals ImpedimentsToMotion →Difﬁculties Evokes: Purposes Are Destinations Metaphor, with Destinations = Self.Source. Destinations Purposes = Self.Target.LifeGoals Difﬁculties Are Impediments to Motion Metaphor, With Impediments to Motion = Self.Source.ImpedimentsToMotion Difﬁculties = Self.Target.Difﬁculties Intimacy Is Closeness Metaphor, With Closeness = Self.Source. ClosenessOf TravelersInVehicle Intimacy = Self.Target. IntimacyOfLovers A Relationship Is A Container Metaphor, With Container = Self.Source.Vehicle Relationship = Self.Target.Relationship The statement that this is a metaphor corresponds to the appropriate mapping cir- cuit. The name of the metaphor corre- sponds to the appropriate gestalt node. The arrows (“→”) correspond to linking circuits. The statement of the mapping speciﬁes what maps to what. The equal signs (“ = ”) specify the neural bindings. The “evokes” statement sets up linking circuits activat- ing the “component” metaphors, with neural bindings between LoveIsAJourney (called “Self” in the formalism) and the various component metaphors. There can be, and often is, a chain of “evokes” statements that ultimately lead to primary metaphors that ground the metaphor system in experience. This formalism is easy for metaphor ana- lysts to learn and use. It can be converted by algorithm to computational neural mod- eling programs that, say, take a sentence as input and produce an analysis as out- put. There are corresponding formalisms for grammatical and lexical constructions, metonymies, frames, image-schemas, and so on. The technical term for the nota- tional system is Embodied Construction Grammar. Conclusion This is where we are in the neural the- ory of metaphor as of November 2006. We have a reasonable early approximation to the kinds of computations that neu- ronal groups must perform to character- ize frames, metaphors, metonymies, men- tal spaces, and blends. A parsing program to use these kinds of computations is being constructed. Thousands of frames and hun- dreds of metaphors have been analyzed informally to date and can readily be con- verted to the notation system. And we know enough about natural metaphor learning to understand how the metaphor system gets built up just by functioning in our everyday lives. The neural theory of metaphor changes cognitive linguistics vastly, not the analyses themselves so much, but our understanding of how metaphor systems work. References Dodge, E., & Lakoff, G. (2006).

Without metaphor, there would be no philosophy. However, philoso- phy’s debt is no greater, nor less, than that of any other signiﬁcant human intellectual ﬁeld or discipline. Philosophers must use the same conceptual resources possessed by any human being, and the potential for any philosophy to make sense of a person’s life depends directly on the fact that all of us are metaphoric animals. What I have just said is not now, nor has it ever been, widely accepted by philoso- phers. In fact, for the major part of our philo- sophical history, the idea that metaphor lies at the heart of human conceptual- ization and reasoning has been rejected.1 One could even make a crude distinc- tion between two types of philosophy – objectivist/literalist philosophies that see metaphor as a dispensable linguistic appur- tenance and those that see philosophies as creative elaborations of basic conceptual metaphors. The history of western philosophy is, for the most part, one long development of the objectivist dismissal of metaphor, punc- tuated rarely by bold declarations of the pervasiveness of metaphor in thought, of which Nietzsche is the most famous pro- ponent. Where a philosopher stands on this key issue can be determined by their answer to one question: are our abstract con- cepts deﬁned by metaphor, or not? Once the question is formulated in this man- ner, it is easy to see the profound philo- sophical stakes at issue. If our most funda- mental abstract concepts – such as those for causation, events, will, thought, rea- son, knowledge, mind, justice, and rights – are irreducibly metaphoric, then philoso- phy must consist in the analysis, criticism, and elaboration of the metaphorical con- cepts out of which philosophies are made. If, on the other hand, you believe that our most important philosophical concepts are, in the ﬁnal analysis, literal, then you will 39\n40 MARK JOHNSON regard metaphor as cognitively insigniﬁcant, and you will relegate it to what you disparag- ingly regard as some distant corner of philos- ophy, typically the unfairly maligned ﬁeld of aesthetics. Anyone who thinks that there is really nothing very important at stake here should consider the following. There are a num- ber of perennial philosophical questions that arise over and over again throughout his- tory any time you reﬂect on the nature of human experience. These are questions such as What is mind, and how does it work? What does it mean to be a person? Is there such a thing as human will, and is it free? What is the nature of reality? What can I know, and how can I go about gaining that knowledge? What things or states are “good” and should therefore be pursued? Are cer- tain actions morally required of us? Does God exist (and what difference would it make)? Is there any meaning to human exis- tence, or is life absurd? Both the framing of these questions and the kinds of answers we give to them depend on metaphor. You cannot address any of these questions without engaging metaphor. Consequently, an adequate phi- losophy must include an extensive inquiry into the workings of metaphor and how it shapes our most important philosophical ideas. Philosophical Concepts Are Metaphoric From a practical standpoint, it is obviously not possible to make an exhaustive sur- vey showing that all our philosophical con- cepts are deﬁned by conceptual metaphors. Instead, I will examine one key concept – causation – to indicate its metaphorical con- stitution, and I will point to research sug- gesting that we use metaphors to deﬁne all of our abstract concepts and thus all of our philosophical concepts. I have selected causation as the exemplary metaphorically deﬁned concept because it is hard to imagine a metaphysical concept that is more fundamental than that of cau- sation. It lies at the heart of all of the sci- ences, is pervasive in our folk theories of the world, and is a philosophical lynchpin of vir- tually every ontology. When the ﬁrst sub- stantial metaphor analysis of our causal con- cepts emerged within cognitive linguistics over a decade ago, it became clear that the implications of this research were stunning. In my own analytic philosophical training, most of the books and articles I read assumed science to be a superior form of knowledge, partly because of its ability to give causal explanations of events. In one philosophi- cal treatise after another, I was struck by how philosophers referred to “causes” as if they were objective forces or entities and as if there existed basically one kind of nat- ural causation (as revealed in expressions such as “X caused Y” and “The cause of Y is X”). In an attempt to explain human actions, many philosophers also spoke of “agent causality,” in order to carve out a space for human “willing,” but in physical nature, natural causes ruled the day. So, there seemed to be at least one type of cause (i.e., physical) but not more than two types (adding agent causation to physical causa- tion), and both conceptions were thought to be literal, not metaphorical. Causes were alleged to be literal entities or forces in the world. This picture, as we will see, turns out to be mistaken, and badly so. It is a mis- take that has disastrous consequences. To see why this is so, let’s begin with an anal- ysis of one of our most often used con- cepts of causation – that of causation as a physical force. Once detailed analyses were performed on the semantics of our causal terms, the metaphorical nature of this concept became quite evident. In cog- nitive linguistics, the study of causal con- cepts emerged from the study of how peo- ple conceptualize events generally. The ﬁrst prominent conceptual metaphor involved an understanding of change of state as (metaphorical) motion from one location to another, according to the following general mapping:2\nPHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR 41 THE LOCATION EVENT-STRUCTURE METAPHOR Source Domain [Motion in Space] Target Domain [Events] Locations in space >>>>> States Movements from one location to another >>>>> Change of states Physical forces >>>>> Causes Forced movement >>>>> Causation Self-propelled movements >>>>> Actions Destinations >>>>> Purposes Paths to destinations >>>>> Means to ends Impediments to motion >>>>> Difﬁculties The location event-structure metaphor comprises a vast complex system of sev- eral submappings, each of which is what Grady (1997) calls a “primary” metaphor. In English, the semantics of our terms for events is given by the detailed structure of the mapping. Each submapping supports a large number of expressions whose depen- dence on metaphor goes largely unnoticed in our ordinary discourse. For example, the submapping Change Of State Is Movement underlies expressions such as “The water went from hot to cold,” “The system is mov- ing toward homeostasis,” and “The pizza is somewhere between warm and cold.” Causa- tion Is Forced Movement is evident in “The ﬁre brought the soup to a boil,” “His treachery pushed the King over the edge,” “The candi- date’s speech threw the crowd into a frenzy.” Notice how these submappings code var- ious dimensions of what linguists call aspect, which concerns the means and manner of an action. For instance, we say, “the stove brought the water to a boil” but not *“the stove threw the water to a boil,” for a very good reason. In the source domain of phys- ical forces and motions, to “bring” some- thing to someone is to apply continuous force to an object to move it from one loca- tion to another, causing it to end up in that person’s possession. When metaphorically extended to causation in general, the seman- tics of bring thus entails continuous applica- tion of force to bring about change of state. Thus, bringing water to a boil entails the con- stant heating of the water until it boils (i.e., until it arrives at the metaphorical boiling- state location). Throwing a physical object, by contrast, involves an initial application of strong force with the object continuing to move to a new location, even after the force is no longer applied. Thus, “threw,” accord- ing to the submapping, is not appropriate for the case of boiling water, though it is just the right term for “Babe Ruth’s homerun threw the crowd into a frenzy.” Now, how could a literalist philosopher have any adequate account of the semantics of throw, as revealed in this case of Ruth’s home run? Will she say that there is a purely literal way to express the type of causa- tion involved here? But there isn’t. If we say, “Babe Ruth’s homerun caused the crowd to get emotionally excited,” we lose the key semantic details expressed by “threw.” “Caused to get excited” does not capture the manner of the causation, which is rapid ini- tial “force” followed by an extended trajec- tory after the initial event. The crucial moral of this example is that the precise details of the semantics of basic causation terms are determined only by the submappings of the metaphors. The infer- ences we make about causal situations come from the metaphorical structure of our cau- sation concepts. You cannot grasp the meaning of the causal terms, nor can you do appropriate causal reasoning, without the metaphors. Moreover, the case of causation is even more complicated than it ﬁrst appears because there turn out to be many differ- ent metaphorical conceptions of types of causation. Analyses to date reveal upwards of twenty distinct metaphors that express twenty kinds of causation (Lakoff & John- son, 1999). A brief survey of just a few of these additional metaphors is highly instruc- tive. It smashes the illusion of core literal concepts of causation and of any objectivist\n42 MARK JOHNSON philosophy that pretends to be founded on such concepts. Consider, for instance, a second major metaphor system for certain types of causation, one that conceives of change of state or having an attribute (or property) as the acquisition of a possession. THE OBJECT EVENT-STRUCTURE METAPHOR Source Domain Target Domain [Transfer of [Change of Possessions] State] Possession >>>>> Attribute Movement of possession >>>>> Change of state Transfer of possession >>>>> Causation Desired objects >>>>> Purposes The submapping Causation Is Transfer Of Possession is evident in expressions such as “Professor Johnson’s lecture on causation gave me a headache, but the aspirin took it away,” “Mary gave her cold to Janice,” and “Janice caught Mary’s cold.” Moreover, even our common philosophical notion of a “property” is based on this metaphorical mapping. What does it mean for an object to “possess” a property? When something has a property, it is in a certain state (deﬁned by that property). When something loses that property, it no longer manifests the features appropriate to that property. Additionally, there are many other submappings within this causation metaphor that specify various ways of acquiring a desired object, which equates metaphorically with acquiring a cer- tain property or attribute and thus achieving a purpose. For example, there is the submap- ping Achieving A Purpose Is Getting Food, as in “I’m hungry for advancement,” “All the best jobs were gobbled up early on,” and “It was a mouthwatering opportunity.” Each of the various ways we acquire food, such as hunting, ﬁshing, and agriculture, show up in the language of our purposeful action, as in r Trying To Achieve A Purpose Is Hunting “I’m still job hunting.” “She is aiming for rapid advancement in the ﬁrm.” “Larry bagged a promotion.” “That idea won’t hunt.” r Trying To Achieve A Purpose Is Fishing “Ann landed a big promotion.” “Before that, she had a line out for a new job.” “My boss is always ﬁshing for compliments.” “Every night he’s out trolling for a date.” r Trying To Achieve A Purpose Is Agricul- ture “Every worker should reap the fruits of his or her labor.” “That promotion is ripe for the picking.” “Harry’s been cultivating several job prospects.” Metaphorically based expressions like these are not just colloquialisms, used loosely in ordinary talk. Once again, the submappings of the metaphor specify the precise details of the semantics of causation and determine what types of inferences we will make. Some people harbor the illusion that good science would merely avoid such expressions in causal explanations. But, as it turns out, there is no way to avoid the use of one or another basic causal metaphor in science, and scientists reason on the basis of the entailments of the submappings of these metaphors. In the social sciences, for example, there are a number of quite speciﬁc metaphors that can be used for the types of causal expla- nation appropriate for the science of those ﬁelds. One especially common case is the causal path metaphor. THE CAUSAL PATH METAPHOR Self-propelled motion >>>>> Action Traveler >>>>> Actor Locations >>>>> States A Lone path >>>>> A natural course of action Being on the path >>>>> Natural causation Leading to >>>>> Results in End of the path >>>>> Resulting ﬁnal state\nPHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR 43 Examples: “Pot smoking leads to drug addiction.” “As a nation, we’re careening wildly down the road to destruction.” “That path will get you nowhere, man.” “You’re heading for catastrophe.” The causal path metaphor plays a key role in certain types of causal explanation for human actions. It utilizes our common knowledge about motion through space to some destination: if you start down a certain path, you will naturally end up where that path leads you, unless something intervenes to retard or block your progress. Metaphor- ically, then, if you start down a certain “path” of action, it will typically lead you to a certain destination (end), unless some- thing intervenes to retard or block your metaphorical movement. This argument is used by those who believe that certain actions or behaviors will necessitate a cer- tain speciﬁc outcome in the ordinary course of events (as in the 1950s song lyric, “I’ll tell you son, you’re gonna drive me to drinkin’, if you don’t stop drivin’ that hot rod Lincoln”). In politics, the causal path metaphor can be even more decisive. One often hears the argument that a certain third- world country is “on the road to democ- racy (read, capitalism),” so that, if we (the United States) will just eliminate any poten- tial obstacles (i.e., we intervene politically, economically, militarily, or covertly), then that country will naturally and inevitably continue along the path to the desired end- state (namely, democracy!). Millions of dol- lars and sometimes even the lives of cit- izens are sacriﬁced to supposedly ensure the smooth unrestricted motion of some metaphorical entity (a country, an economy, or a political institution) along a metaphor- ical causal path to a metaphorically deﬁned destination. Another important metaphor in political and economic debate is the plate tecton- ics metaphor for social/political/economic change, which is appropriated from the geol- ogy of plate tectonics. According to the logic of the metaphor, continual, long-term appli- cation of “pressure” to a system, institution, or state will eventually result in a rapid, mas- sive causal consequence. The rapid, surpris- ing disintegration of the Soviet Union is sup- posed by some to be a classic example of this process. Often, when large sustained infusions of funds or manpower do not appear to be producing the desired change in a government or economy (usually both), the plate tectonics metaphor is frequently invoked to argue for the continued com- mitment of resources by Congress, on the assumption that we need just a little bit more pressure to produce an eventual massive transformation. The analysis of the full range of metaphors could be continued along simi- lar lines. In Philosophy in the Flesh (1999), George Lakoff and I summarized the map- pings and entailments of nearly 20 differ- ent causal metaphors, showing how several of them are employed within various sci- ences. A number of key philosophical points emerge from these analyses: 1. An adequate conceptual analysis (in this case, of causation concepts) must pro- vide generalizations that explain the precise details of the semantics of the terms and must explain the inferences we make concerning those concepts. The details of the semantics and infer- ence structure of each causal concept are provided by the submappings that jointly constitute the metaphor. 2. Almost all of the basic causation con- cepts we studied are metaphoric. 3. There appears to be what we called a “literal skeleton” shared by all cau- sation concepts, namely, that a cause is a determining factor in a situation. However, this bare skeleton is far too underspeciﬁed to generate any serious causal reasoning in the sciences. It is the metaphors that give rise to the relevant conceptual structure and that constrain the appropriate causal inferences. 4. Several of the main causation metaphors are mutually inconsistent. In other words, there are signiﬁcant metaphors that have incompatible ontologies. For example, in the location event-structure metaphor, states are (stationary)\n44 MARK JOHNSON locations, and the object or agent changes by moving to a particular (metaphorical) location. In contrast, in the object event-structure metaphor, a state is an object that moves, rather than being a stationary location. Conse- quently, these two metaphors cannot be reduced to a consistent literal concept. 5. Causation is thus a massive radial cat- egory. At the center of the category is the closest thing to a literal conception – something like the application of phys- ical force to an object that results in a change in its state or location. One example of this is what we call “billiard- ball causation.” Other less prototypical kinds of causation are metaphorically deﬁned. If we take stock of the argument so far, the results are devastating for any lit- eralist/objectivist philosophy. At least with respect to causation, there is no single literal concept of cause, nor are there even two or three basic literal concepts. There is no set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions that deﬁne all causes. Instead, there are 20 or more metaphorical concepts used by ordi- nary people, scientists, and philosophers in their reasoning about causation. This con- clusion does not undermine science at all. It only reminds us that different scientiﬁc approaches rely on different metaphorical concepts, which can be more or less appro- priate in different situations and that dic- tate what counts as evidence and argument within a given science. What these analyses do undermine are objectivist philosophies that accept a classical theory of literal mean- ing, a classical objectivist metaphysics, and a classical correspondence theory of truth. Moreover, it appears that what is true of our causal concepts holds for all of our most important abstract philosophical concepts. The current evidence for this is inductive, but it is very impressive. Many studies have now shown the metaphorical constitution of basic concepts in the sciences (Magnani & Nersessian, 2002), law (Winter, 2001), mathematics (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000), ethics (Fesmire, 2003; Johnson, 1993), medicine (Wright, 2007), politics (Lakoff, 1996), psychology (Fernandez-Duque & Johnson, 2002; Gibbs, 1994), music (Johnson & Lar- son, 2003), and many other ﬁelds. In light of this metaphorical constitution of our abstract concepts, we need to rethink what we are about as philosophers. There does not now exist, and probably never will exist, an exhaustive metaphorical analysis of the full range of philosophical concepts and argu- ments. That would be a daunting, unending task. However, a surprisingly large number of philosophical concepts have already been subjected to conceptual metaphor analysis over the past decade and a half. Here is a partial list of some of the more prominent concepts for which we have at least a pre- liminary metaphorical analysis: Event, Cause, Action, State, Property, Pur- pose, Mind, Thought, Concepts, Reason, Emotions, Knowledge, Attention, Commu- nication, Self, Will, Moral Rule, Rights, Justice, Duty, Good, Happiness, Society, Democracy, Love, Marriage, Being, Num- ber, Set, Inﬁnity, Addition (Subtraction, Multiplication, etc.), the Cartesian Plane, and a host of other mathematical concepts. The number of key concepts analyzed so far, and the depth of those analyses, strongly support the prospect that our abstract con- cepts are deﬁned by conceptual metaphor and metonymy. If this is so, then philosoph- ical analysis is primarily metaphor analy- sis – working out the logic and inferential structure of the metaphors that ground our basic philosophical understanding of experi- ence. Philosophical theories, like all theoret- ical constructions, are elaborations of con- ceptual metaphors. In a very strong sense, philosophy is metaphor. Metaphor and Contemporary Philosophy of Language The reality of conceptual metaphor and its central role in abstract conceptualization and reasoning calls into question large parts of traditional western views of meaning and truth, and it also challenges most of contemporary philosophy of language. If our\nPHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR 45 abstract concepts are metaphorically struc- tured, then the classic objectivist/literalist view must be false. According to objectivist metaphysics and theory of knowledge, the world consists of objects, properties, and relations that exist in them- selves, independent of human conceptual systems and human agency. Meaning is a matter of how our concepts map onto or pick out aspects of this mind-independent objective reality. Literal concepts are the direct connection between what we think (or what’s in our mind) and how the world is, and this connection (sometimes called “intentionality”) is the basis for the possibility of truth, which is taken to be a correspondence relation between proposi- tions and states of affairs in the world. There cannot be any signiﬁcant role for metaphor in this picture of mind and world because the cognitive content of a metaphor would need to be reducible to some set of literal concepts or propositions, if it is to have any meaning and play a role in truth claims. Quite obviously, if conceptual metaphor is essential for abstract thought, then the classic objectivist/literalist picture cannot be correct. Conceptual metaphor is a struc- ture of human understanding, and the source domains of the metaphors come from our bodily, sensory-motor experience, which becomes the basis for abstract conceptual- ization and reasoning. From this perspec- tive, truth is a matter of how our body-based understanding of a sentence ﬁts, or fails to ﬁt, our body-based understanding of a situation. And when we are thinking with abstract con- cepts, that understanding involves concep- tual metaphor. There is a form of “correspon- dence” here – a ﬁtting of our understanding of a statement and our understanding of a situation. But this is not the classic corre- spondence of literal propositions to objec- tive states of affairs in the world. Instead, the correspondence is mediated by embod- ied understanding of both the sentence and the situation. In spite of the growing body of empiri- cal research on conceptual metaphor that has emerged over the past two decades, con- temporary analytic philosophy of language has refused to recognize the existence of conceptual metaphor. This is not surprising, considering that to do so would undermine certain fundamental assumptions of analytic philosophy. I want to examine brieﬂy two of the most popular contemporary views of metaphor within analytic philosophy – that of John Searle and the view shared by Don- ald Davidson and Richard Rorty – in order to show why they cannot accept the reality of conceptual metaphor and how they are done in by its existence. Searle (1979) approaches metaphor from a speech-act perspective, and he regards the activity of speaking a language as a highly conventionalized rule-governed form of behavior. Searle is also a literalist. He believes that the possibility of truth claims and a robust realism requires that all mean- ing be reducible to literal concepts and propositions that can, in the last analy- sis, correspond to states of affairs in the world. Various types of illocutionary speech acts would, according to Searle’s account, be rule-governed functions on these basic propositional contents. So, the problem of metaphor within Searle’s philosophy of lan- guage is to state the rules by which the lit- eral sentence meaning (“S is P”) used for a metaphorical utterance can come to be interpreted by a hearer as a different literal utterance meaning (“S is R”) (Searle, 1979). On Searle’s view, the hearer must recog- nize that the speaker cannot be intending to convey the literal meaning of her utterance, must then calculate the possible alternate meanings she might possibly be intending, and must ﬁnally determine which is the most appropriate literal meaning in the present context. The problem with this literalist/ objectivist version of the speech-act approach is that it simply cannot explain how metaphors actually work. Searle correctly sees that most metaphors are not based on an underlying set of literal similarities that might explain how P (in “S is P”) calls up R (in “S is R”) when we hear the metaphorical utterance. But Searle has no alternative speciﬁcation of the rules for cases that cannot be based on similarities.\n46 MARK JOHNSON He must surely recognize that his ﬁnal attempt to formulate a rule for certain types of metaphors is no explanation at all! Things which are P are not R, nor are they like R things, nor are they believed to be R; nonetheless it is a fact about our sensibil- ity, whether culturally or naturally deter- mined, that we just do perceive a connec- tion. (Searle, 1979, p. 108) Saying that it just “is a fact about our sensi- bility” that we do make certain connections does not explain anything. When a literalist is forced to admit that certain metaphors are not based on any literal similarities between the source and target domains, then his literalism leaves him without resources to explain where the meaning comes from or how it is possible. Conceptual metaphor theory solves this problem by rejecting literalism and by recognizing the pervasive structuring of our abstract concepts by metaphor. On this view, metaphors are based on experiential correlations and not on similarities. Joe Grady (1997) has analyzed the experiential grounding of a large number of what he calls “primary metaphors” that are sometimes combined into larger metaphor sys- tems. Consider, for example, the primary metaphor Affection Is Warmth. Grady hypothesizes that this metaphor is based, not on similarities between warmth and affection, but rather on our experience, from infancy, of being held affectionately and feeling warmth. Multiple experiences of this sort in childhood would involve a neuronal co-activation of brain areas tied to the experience of bodily warmth and those tied to the subjective experience of affection and nurturance. This co-activation later becomes the basis for a primary metaphor, Affection Is Warmth. One of Searle’s well-known arguments against the similarity theory of metaphor is that there are no relevant literal similarities between a person named Sally and a block of ice that could explain the meaning of the metaphorical expression, “Sally is a block of ice.” Quite so, for this expression is not based on similarities. Rather, it is an instance of the primary metaphor Affection Is Warmth, and so it is based on experiential correlations (of affection and warmth), rather than on similarities. If anything, the similarities are a result of the experienced correlation. However, Searle cannot accept this alternative theory because his literalism does not permit him to recognize that metaphoric source-to-target mappings could be equally as basic to our thought as are literal concepts. Searle’s theory is constrained by his traditional objectivist views of meaning, knowledge, and truth. Another extremely popular view of metaphor is Donald Davidson’s deﬂationary rejection of metaphoric meaning. In his 1978 article, “What Metaphors Mean,” Davidson provocatively answers that they do not mean anything at all or at least nothing beyond the ordinary literal meaning of the utter- ance. In short, Davidson simply denies that metaphor is a semantic phenomenon, and he thus denies that metaphor has anything to do with making truth-claims: “We must give up the idea that a metaphor carries a message, that it has a content or meaning (except, of course, its literal meaning)” (Davidson, 1978, p. 45). Metaphor is only a pragmatic effect achieved by using a certain literal utterance to induce the hearer to notice something. Davidson says that a metaphorical utterance uses its literal meaning to “intimate” or “sug- gest” some nonpropositional insight: “Seeing as is not seeing that. Metaphor makes us see one thing as another by making some lit- eral statement that inspires or prompts the insight.” (Davidson, 1978, p. 47). Richard Rorty has become the ﬂamboy- ant spokesman for Davidson’s nonsemantic theory of metaphor. Seizing on Davidson’s claim that metaphor is not about proposi- tional content or meaning of any kind, Rorty describes metaphors as linguistic ﬂares that catch and redirect the hearer’s attention: Tossing a metaphor into a conversation is like suddenly breaking off the conversation long enough to make a face, or pulling a photograph out of your pocket and display- ing it, or pointing at a feature of the sur- roundings, or slapping your interlocutor’s face, or kissing him. Tossing a metaphor\nPHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR 47 into a text is like using italics, or illus- trations, or odd punctuation or formats. All these are ways of producing effects on your interlocutor or your reader but not ways of conveying a message. (Rorty, 1989, p. 18) This view of metaphor as a nonsemantic use of language for certain attention-getting purposes has an important implication that Rorty is quick to note. The distinction between the “literal” and the “metaphorical” is seen, not as one “between two sorts of meaning, nor a distinction between two sorts of interpretation, but as a distinc- tion between familiar and unfamiliar uses of noises and marks” (Rorty, 1989, p. 17). According to Rorty, these “unfamiliar” marks and noises somehow get us searching for new vocabularies in which they are no longer unfamiliar, but he has no account whatever of how this process is supposed to work. The considerable popularity of both Searle’s and Davidson-Rorty’s view is eas- ily understandable within the framework of analytic philosophy of language. As different as their two views may appear to be on the surface, they both share a set of grounding assumptions about meaning and truth that are foundational for analytic philosophy. In particular, they agree (1) that meaning is con- ceptual and propositional in nature, (2) that meaning is truth-conditional, and (3) that only literal concepts can be the bearers of meaning. Searle thinks that metaphors can have a semantic content of sorts, but he is at a loss as to how to explain that possibil- ity, since he sees that they are not based on literal similarities and don’t seem to be lit- eral propositions. Davidson and Rorty think that metaphors have no semantic content, are not propositional, and so cannot be bear- ers of truth. Both theories are badly mistaken. Both theories ignore the growing body of empir- ical research on conceptual metaphor as a basic operation of abstract thinking. It should come as no surprise that neither Searle nor Davidson pays any serious atten- tion to the work of cognitive linguists on the semantics of natural languages. If they did, they would acknowledge the pervasive role of conceptual metaphor in abstract concep- tualization and reasoning. How could Searle, or especially Davidson, explain our previous analysis of the semantics and inference struc- ture of our metaphors for causation? Their literalist views have no resources whatever to explain the polysemy and inference gen- eralizations that are explained in cognitive linguistics by the source-to-target mappings. Rorty sees quite clearly that his view has nothing whatsoever to say about the mean- ing and motivation for basic metaphors in science and philosophy: For all we know, or should care, Aristo- tle’s metaphorical use of ousia, Saint Paul’s metaphorical use of agap´e, and Newton’s metaphorical use of gravitas, were the results of cosmic rays scrambling the ﬁne structure of some crucial neurons in their respective brains. Or, more plausibly, they were the result of some odd episodes in infancy – some obsessional kinks left in these brains by idiosyncratic traumata. It hardly matters how the trick was done. The results were marvelous. (Rorty, 1989, p. 17) This is extremely clever, and beautifully expressed, but it is quite wrongheaded. For it does matter “how the trick was done.” It does matter where these metaphors come from – that is, why we have the ones we do, how they are grounded experientially, and how they shape our thought. Moreover, there are (at least partial) answers to such questions, answers provided by conceptual metaphor theory, that challenge the basic assumptions of contemporary analytic phi- losophy of language. Rorty is probably right that we aren’t going to explain precisely why St. Paul came up with the metaphor for love that he did. But that does not mean that his metaphor was an irrational, unmotivated miracle, or a chance occurrence! Our inability to predict what novel metaphors will emerge does not entail the opposite extreme that metaphors just happen, irrationally. On the contrary, there is a great deal that we can say about what St. Paul’s metaphor means, about how it connects up with the other conceptual\n48 MARK JOHNSON metaphors for love that were common in his time (and in ours), and about how his metaphor extends or creatively blends aspects of these other metaphors. Concep- tual metaphor theory can explain how this new metaphor could possibly make any sense to people and how they could draw inferences about its implications for how they should live their lives. Within cognitive linguistics, there already exist extensive anal- yses of the mappings for the key metaphors for love in our culture (K¨ovecses, 1988, 2000; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Nor did the Aristotlean conception of ousia spring fully armed from the head of Aristotle. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) have traced some of the main steps in the development of the metaphori- cal understanding of Being that begins with the pre-Socratic philosophers, blossoms in Plato, and is transformed in Aristotle. The idea of Being is a construction from various folk theories and conceptual metaphors con- cerning the nature of categories and entities in the world. Aristotle’s ousia is a remarkable achievement, but it is not a miracle. If, like Davidson and Rorty, you don’t see that metaphor is a semantic phenomenon, then it should come as no surprise that, like them, you will regard metaphor merely as a nonrational rupture in a conceptual system (or, to use Rorty’s favorite term, a “vocab- ulary”) that inexplicably gives rise to a new way of talking. If you miss the experiential grounding of primary metaphors, you will, like Rorty, think that metaphor change is relatively arbitrary and not rationally moti- vated. Moreover, you will not recognize the crucial role of metaphor in shaping and constraining inference in ordinary mundane thinking, scientiﬁc research, and philosophi- cal theorizing. In other words, Davidson and Rorty are literalists. Because they are obliv- ious to the pervasive workings of concep- tual metaphor in shaping our conceptual sys- tems, they cannot see that or how metaphor lies at the heart of human understanding and reasoning. Philosophy as Metaphor Virtually all of our abstract concepts appear to be structured by multiple, typically incon- sistent conceptual metaphors. If this is true, then philosophical theories are not systems of foundational literal truths about reality but rather elaborations of particular com- plex intertwining sets of metaphors that support inferences and forms of reasoning. Humanizing and embodying philosophy in this manner does not devalue it in any way. On the contrary, it reveals why we have the philosophies we do, explains why and how they can make sense of our experience, and traces out their implications for our lives. In Philosophy in the Flesh (1999), Lakoff and Johnson analyzed several philosophi- cal orientations to reveal their underlying metaphors. That analysis included pre- Socratic metaphysics, Platonic and Aris- totelian doctrines of Being, Cartesian views of mind and thought, and some of the found- ing assumptions of analytic philosophy of mind and language. As an example of how a metaphorical analysis of this kind might proceed, I want to consider Jerry Fodor’s “Language of Thought” metaphor for mind, since it has been so inﬂuential in recent phi- losophy of mind. Fodor wants to defend what he regards as a scientiﬁcally sophisti- cated version of the widespread folk the- ory that to have a mind is to have mental states (e.g., beliefs, wants, fears, hopes) that purport to be “about” aspects of our world. Thinking, as he sees it, must consist of chains of inner mental states that are somehow connected to each other (i.e., one thought leads to another) and that are also some- how connected to aspects of our experience (i.e., things in the world “cause” us to have these speciﬁc mental representations that we have). There are thus two major parts to Fodor’s theory: (1) how the mental states are related and (2) how those mental states are connected to the world (or how they are caused). The ﬁrst part of his theory consists of the claim that these mental states form a “lan- guage of thought”: “A train of thoughts . . . is a causal sequence of tokenings of men- tal representations which express proposi- tions that are the objects of the thoughts” (Fodor, 1987, p. 17). The language of thought is purely computational:\nPHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR 49 Mental states are relations between organ- isms and internal representations, and causally interrelated mental states suc- ceed one another according to computa- tional principles which apply formally to the representations. This is the sense in which internal representations provide the domains for such data processes as inform the mental life. It is, in short, of the essence of cognitive theories that they seek to interpret physical (causal) transformations as trans- formations of information, with the effect of exhibiting the rationality of mental pro- cesses. (Fodor, 1975, p. 198) Fodor’s language of thought (sometimes called “mentalese”), consists of symbols that in themselves are completely meaningless but that can be given meaning by the ways in which they are caused, or “tokened,” by certain events in the world. The mental representations in this language of thought are precisely like the arbitrary, meaningless symbols in computer programs. Within a computational program, operations are per- formed entirely on the formal (syntactic) features of the symbols, and Fodor believes that such features can “mimic” what we think of as semantic relations between our various mental representations: Within certain famous limits, the seman- tic relation that holds between two symbols when the proposition expressed by the one is entailed by the proposition expressed by the other can be mimicked by syntactic rela- tions in virtue of which one of the symbols is derivable from the other. (Fodor, 1987, p. 19) The second key part of Fodor’s theory concerns the causal grounding of the internal representations. His claim is that these sym- bols are mental representations because they are caused by aspects of the world. Fodor summarizes this aspect of his theory: I want a naturalized theory of meaning: a theory that articulates, in nonsemantic and nonintentional terms, sufﬁcient condi- tions for one bit of the world to be about (to express, represent, or be true of) another bit. (Fodor, 1987, p. 98) Fodor and his followers believe that the language of thought hypothesis expresses literal truths about the nature of mind, namely, that the mind is a computational functional program, that thinking is gov- erned by syntactic rules, and that the mean- ingless symbols of mentalese are given mean- ing through their relation to aspects of our experience that cause them to be tokened in our minds. A large body of empirical research in the cognitive sciences shows why this view of mind cannot be correct, but that is not my focus here. Rather, my point is to show that Fodor’s entire model is composed of a series of interwoven complex metaphors that give rise to speciﬁc entailments about the nature of mind and the operations of thought. Fodor’s key claim that all human think- ing has the form of a language is an idea (a false idea) deeply rooted in our ordinary and philosophical ways of thinking. Because we so often express our thoughts in language, we are easily seduced into believing that human thinking has the form of a language. In other words, we presuppose the Thought As Language metaphor. THE THOUGHT AS LANGUAGE METAPHOR Source Domain Target Domain [Linguistic Acts] [Thinking] Linguistic activity (speaking/ writing) >>>> Thinking Words >>>>> Ideas Sentences >>>>> Complex ideas Spelling >>>>> Communicating a sequence of thoughts Writing >>>>> Memorization Our ordinary ways of thinking about the operations of mind and thought draw mas- sively on our conception of written and spo- ken language. The idea that thoughts are linguistic forms written in the mind is the basis for expressions such as, “Let me make a mental note of that,” “She’s an open book to me – I can read her every thought,” “The public misread the President’s intentions,” and “Do you think I’m some kind of\n50 MARK JOHNSON mindreader?” Spoken language also provides a rich source domain for our conception of thinking as speaking, as in, “She doesn’t listen to her conscience,” “I hear what you mean,” “I can barely hear myself think,” and “That sounds like a good idea.” The Thought As Language metaphor covers all types of intel- lectual activity, as in, “Liberals and conser- vatives don’t speak the same language,” “He can’t translate his good ideas into practice,” “What is the vocabulary of basic philosophi- cal ideas?” and “I wouldn’t read too much into what he’s saying.” Notice also that, according to this mapping, careful step-by-step think- ing is conceived as careful spelling, as when we say, “Our theory of embodied meaning is spelled out in Chapter 3,” “Do I have to spell it out for you?” and “He always follows the letter of the law.” Fodor’s language of thought metaphor makes intuitive sense to many people pre- cisely because most of us assume that a purely formal language can be meaningful in the same way that a natural language is meaningful. That is, we assume the formal language metaphor. THE FORMAL LANGUAGE METAPHOR Source Domain Target Domain [Natural [Formal Language] Language] Written signs >>>>> Abstract formal symbols A natural language >>>>> A Formal language Sentences >>>>> Well-formed symbol sequences Syntax >>>> Principles for combining formal symbols Fodor correctly understands that a truly computational theory of mind requires that the language of thought be a formal lan- guage (akin to a computer language), and that a formal language cannot be modeled on a natural language. A “formal” language is an artiﬁcial language that, unlike natu- ral languages, consists entirely of arbitrary meaningless symbols, each of which has spe- ciﬁc formal (syntactic) features that play a role in formal operations speciﬁed for the language. The key problem with this formal lan- guage metaphor is that actual formal lan- guages do not and cannot possess the key features that make it possible for natural languages to be meaningful. Consequently, if Mind Is A Computational Program (i.e., the Mind As Computer metaphor), then the Language of Thought will not, in itself, be meaningful in any way. As a result, Fodor must ofﬁcially reject the formal language metaphor. But then he is left with the prob- lem of how an intrinsically meaningless Lan- guage of Thought can somehow acquire meaning. Fodor’s answer is that “tokenings” of par- ticular mental symbols must become “repre- sentations” by being “caused” by objects and events that we experience. In other words, the “inner” mental symbols must be causally connected to things outside the mind. In his book Psychosemantics (1987), Fodor tries to develop a causal theory of how the symbols in mentalese can become meaningful, that is, how the symbols can come to be related to things “outside” the mind. Although I cannot argue this here, Fodor is ultimately unable to explain how there is a determi- nate connection between being in a certain situation and having certain speciﬁc symbols tokened in the mind. He cannot establish such relations for the reasons that Quine earlier articulated; namely, the “input” is always subject to multiple interpretations, so there is seldom or never a one-to-one corre- spondence between a mental symbol and an aspect of the “world.” Philosophy’s Debt to Metaphor My interest here is not to evaluate the ade- quacy of Fodor’s theory of mind and lan- guage. It is, rather, to show that his theory is based on a set of intertwined concep- tual metaphors that operate, mostly uncon- sciously, in our culture. It is no criticism of a philosophical or scientiﬁc theory to show the underlying metaphors on which\nPHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR 51 it rests. Indeed, it is the metaphors that make it possible for the theories to make sense of our experience. All theories are based on metaphors because all our abstract concepts are metaphorically deﬁned. Under- standing the constitutive metaphors allows you to grasp the logic and entailments of the theory. Thus, we will discover vari- ous common metaphors underpinning our philosophical theories, ranging from the pre-Socratics’ notions of Being and physis, to ideas about God in medieval theology, to Cartesian doctrines of mind, and up to 21st-century neurocomputational theories of cognition. It would be impractical to try to sur- vey the metaphorical foundations of all our philosophical theories. But it is a task that can and should be undertaken if we want to understand the inner workings of any particular theory in philosophy or science. This task will always include a metaphor- ical analysis of concepts such as cause, being, reality, and event but also of all aspects of mind and thought themselves, such as the grounding metaphors for con- cepts, reason, mind, thought, knowledge, logical relations, and values that lie at the heart of a speciﬁc theory. Even the theo- ries of metaphor themselves must be ana- lyzed. The theory of conceptual metaphor, for example, employs metaphors of “map- ping” and “projection” to conceptualize the nature of metaphor itself. Such a conception could never be absolute – could never tell the whole story or cover all of the data – and so we must always be self-reﬂectively aware of our own metaphorical assumptions and their limitations. I have argued that the single biggest rea- son that most traditional and contempo- rary philosophy cannot recognize the per- vasive, theory-constituting role of metaphor in philosophy is the failure of philosophers to acknowledge the existence of deep sys- tematic conceptual metaphor. They cannot recognize it because to do so would require a fairly substantial revision of some of the founding assumptions of their philosophies. It would require them to abandon some of their founding metaphorical conceptions in favor of other metaphors. If you acknowl- edge conceptual metaphor, then you have to give up literalism. If you give up literal- ism, you must abandon objectivist theories of knowledge. If you reject objectivist meta- physics and epistemology, you must aban- don the classical correspondence theory of truth. Eventually, you will have to rethink even your most basic conception of what cognition consists in. The hold on us of objectivist and liter- alist views is so strong that we are sorely tempted to go to great lengths to salvage our traditional theories of mind, thought, and language. Searle ultimately falls back on a form of literalism. Davidson retains his liter- alism by denying that metaphors have mean- ing beyond their literal sense. Rorty doesn’t appear to be a literalist since he sees that metaphors are terribly important in the his- tory of philosophy, but he has no theoretical resources to explain the phenomena as any- thing more than contingent, irrational, inex- plicable random events. In sharp contrast, once you understand how conceptual metaphors lie at the heart of our abstract conceptualization and rea- soning, you acquire a new set of tools for analyzing, explaining, and criticizing philo- sophical theories. Philosophies are built out of conceptual metaphors. We need not be slaves operating blindly under the harsh inﬂuence of our metaphors. We can learn what our founding metaphors are and how they work. We can analyze the metaphors underlying other cultures and philosophical systems, too. Our ability to do this type of analysis is, admittedly, always itself shaped by metaphorical conceptions of which we are hardly ever aware. However, we can become aware of those metaphors, we can subject them to critical evaluation, and we can creatively elaborate them in develop- ing new philosophies to help us deal with the problems that confront us in our daily lives. Notes 1 In Philosophical Perspectives on Metaphor (1981), I have surveyed some of the more inﬂuential expressions in Western philosophy\n52 MARK JOHNSON of the denial of a serious cognitive role for metaphor. 2 The analysis of causal concepts that follows, along with their role in shaping philosophy, is adapted, with minor changes, from Lakoff and Johnson (1999), chapter 11, which is an extensive survey of the several metaphors that deﬁne our multiple concepts of events and causes.

Conceptual Mappings The study of conceptual mappings, includ- ing metaphoric mappings, has produced great insights over the past several decades, not only for the study of language but also for the study of such subjects as scien- tiﬁc discovery, design, mathematical think- ing, and computer interfaces. This tradition of inquiry is fulﬁlling its promises, with new ﬁndings and new applications all the time. Looking for conceptual mappings and their properties proves to be a rich method for discovery.1 To the initial studies that focused on cross-domain mappings and their most visible products have now been added many additional dimensions. Detailed studies have been carried out on topics such as compres- sion, integration networks, and the princi- ples and constraints that govern them.2 This blooming ﬁeld of research has as one consequence the rethinking of metaphor. We have a richer and deeper understand- ing of the processes underlying metaphor than we did previously. In this article, we will illustrate the central areas of theo- retical advance by looking in some detail at the often-studied metaphor of TIME AS SPACE. The points we shall emphasize are the following: – Integration networks. Conceptual prod- ucts are never the result of a single map- ping. What we have come to call “con- ceptual metaphors,” like TIME IS MONEY or TIME IS SPACE, turn out to be mental constructions involving many spaces and many mappings in elaborate integration networks constructed by means of over- arching general principles. These integra- tion networks are far richer than the bun- dles of pairwise bindings considered in recent theories of metaphor. – Cobbling and sculpting. Such integration networks are never built entirely on the ﬂy nor are they preexisting conventional structures. Integration networks under- lying thought and action are always a mix. On the one hand, cultures build networks over long periods of time that get transmitted over generations. Tech- niques for building particular networks are also transmitted. People are capable of innovating in any particular context. 53\n54 GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER The result is integration networks consist- ing of conventional parts, conventionally structured parts, and novel mappings and compressions. This very general point is illustrated in section 5 of our paper, with the passage “Emily’s diary.” – Compression. A remarkable conclusion of recent work which was overlooked by both early metaphor theory and early blending theory is that integration net- works achieve systematic compressions. The ability to use standard techniques and patterns of compression and decom- pression enables us to work at once over elaborate integration networks. For example, a cause–effect relation connect- ing different mental spaces in the net- work may be compressed into a repre- sentation relation or an identity relation within the integration network. Well- known examples often discussed in the blending literature include The Grim Reaper, Digging one’s own grave, Clinton and the Titanic.3 For TIME AS SPACE, watches, clocks, and other time-telling devices anchor timepiece blends with powerful built-in compressions. – Inference. Inference transfer is not in itself the driving force behind metaphor. In fact, it is typical for “source-domain” inferences to be violated in the emergent blended space. This is because topologies in the multiple inputs may clash, so that not everything will project to the blended spaces. – Emergent structure. The focus on single mapping and inference transfer in early metaphor theory left out many of the powers of integration networks, in par- ticular the ability to develop emergent structure based on preexisting concep- tual structures and to achieve compres- sions across them. In fact, as we shall see, the metaphorical mappings that seem most fundamental and observable, such as SPACE →TIME, can themselves be emer- gent in elaborate networks with succes- sive blending. – Various species of conceptual integra- tion. What were previously regarded as separate phenomena and even separate mental operations – counterfactuals, framings, categorizations, metonymies, metaphors, and so on – are consequences of the same basic human ability for double-scope blending. More speciﬁcally, these phenomena are all the product of integration networks under the same general principles and overarching goals. They are separable neither in theory nor in practice: the majority of cases involve more than one kind of integration. The resulting products can belong simulta- neously to any (or none) of the surface types “metaphors,” “counterfactuals,” “analogies,” “framings,” “categorizations,” or “metonymies.” The networks discussed below for the conception of time are a case in point. As shown below, they yield surface metaphors, counterfactuals, metonymies, and frames. 2. Time Is Space, and Then Some To illustrate how metaphor has been rethought within the broader perspective of integration networks and compression, we will revisit the classic metaphor of time as space and show in some detail that much of what is going on in this metaphor has gone unnoticed and therefore unexplained.4 Time as space is a deep metaphor for all human beings. It is common across cul- tures, psychologically real, productive, and profoundly entrenched in thought and lan- guage. Once recognized, the mapping seems nonproblematic: the ordering of space is pro- jected to the ordering of time, and inferences are obtained straightforwardly for the source domain and projected to the target domain. As established by metaphor theory, the new conceptualization of the domain of time is obtained through projection from space. For example, the fact that time is measurable and stable – inferences for which we do not have independent evidence – comes from the domain of space.5 But metaphors, this one included, involve more than mappings or bindings between two spaces. They involve many spaces, and\nRETHINKING METAPHOR 55 they involve emergent structure in the net- work. The apparently unproblematic map- ping by itself will not account for the com- plex emergent structure of the network and the data that express it. To see this, let us start by looking infor- mally at the full emergent structure that comes with this metaphor. Consider the fol- lowing examples: 1. Three hours went by, and then he had dinner. 2. *Three feet went by, and he was at the door. 3. Minutes are quick but hours are slow. 4. *Inches go by faster than feet. 5. Those three hours went by slowly for me, but the same three hours went by quickly for him. 6. For me, the hours were minutes, but for her, the minutes were hours. 7. At the end of the three hours, you will have solved the problem, but at the end of the same three hours, he will have solved it and ﬁve more. 8. Time came to a halt. 9. Sure, it’s Friday afternoon, but Monday morning is already staring us in the face. 10. Next week was an eternity away. 11. For me, the three hours were forever, but for her, they did not exist. 12. It’ll go by faster if you stop thinking about it. 13. Our wedding was just yesterday. 14. Where have all those years disappeared? 15. Next week was an eternity away. 16. I didn’t see those years go by. Example 1 shows that we have not merely projected units of measurement onto time but also turned those units into moving objects. This does not come from project- ing units of measurement onto time. In the domain of space, a unit of measurement is not a moving object. These are incompati- ble sorts of elements. But in the blend, we project onto a temporal experience both unit of measurement and moving object from the domain of space. Incompatible elements in the domain for space are thus fused to identity for time in the blend. The notion of hours as simultaneously moving objects and units of measurement is emergent in the blended space. Example 3 shows two things: that the emergent, moving temporal units have speed and that some have greater speed than others. But how could this be? The con- stituent parts of a moving object in space must all move at the same speed. Hours are composed of minutes. A straightforward “metaphoric” projection would require that minutes, hours, centuries, eons would all have the same speed. What has happened is that uncoupled objects that move at differ- ent speeds in space are projected onto con- stituent parts of a temporal interval in the blend. There is a paradox in the standard metaphor analysis of time as space in hav- ing a source domain of moving objects that includes speed, since speed already seems to require time. This paradox is resolved in the standard analysis by assuming that motion is uniform, so that speed is irrelevant. But as we see, speed is relevant in the emer- gent conception of time. In fact, example 5 shows that not only can speed be different for different moving objects, but the same moving object can have different speeds. This is because we are also projecting to the temporal units in the blend our subjective experience of time and events. In our subjec- tive, conscious experience, we have no reli- able measure of time, but we do have strong feelings about the pace of events. In the blended structure, a “slow hour” is an hour to which we project our subjective experi- ence of the events of that hour. That is why we can say, “For me, the hours were min- utes, but for her, the minutes were hours.” Some exceptionally fast hours can have the speed of “normal” minutes. Some very slow minutes can have the speed of “normal” hours. And it is not just as if units of time can go fast or slowly; they can also stop altogether, as in “Time came to a halt.” And it’s not just as if units of time can have variable speed. They can also have vari- able existence, as in, “For me, the three hours were forever, but for her, they did not exist.”\n56 GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER In the topology of the domain of objects moving in space, all moving objects must be in different locations, and it is unusual (except, e.g., in the case of trains) that they follow the identical path. But in the blend for time, we are all in the same spot, and the very same times are moving past us on the same path. In the topology of the domain of objects moving in space, the observers are typically at different locations, which is why they may experience the speed of the objects dif- ferently. But in the blend for time, all the observers are at the identical location. It is not their relative locations that account for the variation in perceived speed, but their attitudes toward the events that account for the variation in the speeds. The varia- tion of speed for time is coming from the input mental space of felt experience, not from the domain of objects moving in space. The resulting emergent structure is actually incompatible with the physical space input. In the topology of the domain of objects moving in space, distance is well ordered. Space is continuous and objects have per- manence, and neither stretches of space nor objects in them vanish. But salience of times can be blended with temporal units to such an extent that, in the blend, salient times whose onset we fear can be closer and move faster. If Monday is all-important and we are anxious about what happens on Mon- day, we can say, “Monday is staring me in the face,” even if there are several days between now and Monday. In the blend, salient times whose onset we welcome can be farther away and move more slowly, as in, “It’s eons until my birthday,” or “My birthday never gets any closer.” To summarize, the topology of the blend for time is incompatible with the domain of objects moving in space in many fundamen- tal ways: – In the domain of space, units of mea- surement are not moving objects. In the blend, they are. – In the domain of space, observers are not at the same location and are not looking in the same direction. In the blend, they are. Accordingly, in the blend, everyone sees the same moving objects (that is, sees the same temporal units). – In the domain of space, not all moving objects are on the same path. In the blend, they are. – In the domain of space, observers in the same location looking in the same direc- tion would see not only the same mov- ing objects but also the same speeds for those objects. But in the blend, observers are in the same location and looking in the same direction and seeing the same moving objects, but they perceive (in principle) different speeds for those objects. – In the domain of space, all the objects moving along a path exist, and the closer ones are perceived as closer. But in the blend, one more distant can seem closer, and some of the objects can be nonexis- tent. – In the domain of space, you cannot speed up or slow down the speed of the mov- ing object by the quality of your atten- tion. But in the blend, varying your atten- tion can change the speed of the moving object. These various linguistic examples and the emergent structures that make them possi- ble derive from a systematic but elaborate integration network that involves a number of input spaces, blended spaces, vital rela- tions, and compressions. We will go through the relevant input spaces and intermediate blends. E: E is the input of Events. Human beings are expert at parsing the world into events (selling shoes, solving math problems, din- ing) and objects. Here we take as given that people can think of events and objects and refer to them. This expertise includes under- standing event shape, including ordering and event type, and categorizing different events as belonging to the same type or to differ- ent types. Event spaces can include subjec- tive experience of those events. Under this parsing, a lecture is an event with many participants – the lecturer, the audience, the support staff – and each participant\nRETHINKING METAPHOR 57 experiences the same event in a variety of different possible ways. So the lecture can be painful for me, pleasant for you, difﬁcult for the lecturer, easy for the technician, chal- lenging for the interpreter. X: An important kind of event for human beings is motion through physical space from point A to point B, with correspond- ing objective and subjective experiences. We call this subset of E the input of experienced motion through physical space. Within X, we have a number of existing correlations. If we travel from A to B and then B to C, we know that the event of traveling from A to B is over before the event of traveling from A to C is over. This comes from our ability to order events. So, all else being equal, rela- tive length corresponds to ordering of events. AB is shorter than AC; the event <AB> is over before the event <AC>. In this space, the use of the notion of fast versus slow is not the one used in physics but correlates with the duration of events. So, in English, we say that going from A to B is “faster” than going from A to C, even if our speed in the technical sense is the same. In X, the event of traversing the path is connected with the path. E/X: E and X are blended in routine ways to yield emergent structure. One conse- quence of this blending is to create the com- mon notion that has sometimes been called the Event Structure Metaphor.6 According to this notion, we can “go through the lec- ture” just as we can “go through the park” because in the blend the event is motion from one point to another. In the blend E/X, any event has length and experienced motion (including speed, in the everyday sense of fast and slow rather than in the tech- nical sense of physics). In E/X, the traveler of input X is fused with the experiencer of input E. The event in E is fused with the event of traversing the path in X and with the path in X. By this means, in the blend, an event becomes a path, and completing the event is traversing the path. As we can say that one stretch of road is faster than another because the event of traveling the ﬁrst is over before the event of traveling the other, just so, we can say that one event is faster than another. E/X is a blend of a quite dif- fuse domain of events with a rather speciﬁc human-scale subcase of traversing a path, so that in the blend the perhaps diffuse event can be transformed to human scale. In fact, it seems from the data we have collected so far that however complicated our understand- ing of the domain of traversing paths (involv- ing different terrain, vehicles, etc.), X takes into account only the lengths of the paths, so that for a given traveler, relative lengths of paths determines relative durations of traversal. In the blended space, an event is an origin and a destination. Two travelers may begin at the same origin and arrive at the same destination; yet, they might traverse differ- ent paths, so the event can be long for one but short for the other and can be slow for one and fast for the other. M: The socially (and technologically) constructed notion of time is then brought in independently as the blended domain M studied in The Way We Think (Fauconnier & Turner 2002). For starters, analogous days that we experience through observation – of, say, sun, stars, color variation, and so on – are compressed under blending into a single cyclic day (see Figure 3.1). This blended cyclic day, C, serves as one input to yet another blended space, M. The other input to M is a natural or technical dynamic mechanism with structure that gets partially and systematically mapped onto the cyclic day. To give one example of the map- ping between the “mechanism” input space and the “cyclic day” input space, we map the situation in which both rotating rods on the face of a “clock” point to 12 in the “mechanism” space onto the sun’s being at its zenith in the cyclic day. In the blend, M, the cyclic day is integrated with the motion of the mechanism and we have addi- tional shared events such as hours, minutes, seconds, years.\n58 GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER noon d u s k night time night time night time Figure 3.1. The blended cyclic day (C). M is built on the basis of standard, normed, shared events such as “hands going around the clock.” It yields emergent struc- ture of hours, minutes, seconds, years, . . . , which do not exist before the creation of these compressions to ideal events. These are now, in M, standard shared events. The culturally constructed domain, M, is thus a subset of the general domain of events, E, and some inputs to the blend M may have motion in space, for technological or natu- ral reason (hands on the clock, sand in the hourglass, sun across the sky, . . .). The crucial feature of these material time- pieces is that they have, within tolerance, matching onset and termination for the same constructed events (minute, hour, day, . . .). How they operate between onset and termi- nation is unimportant for the mapping, as is how they mark onset and termination, so long as onset and termination stay invariant across timepieces. If they match, then, for purposes of the M network, we can com- press various timepieces to one ideal time- piece because the particular onsets compress to the ideal onset and the particular termi- nations compress to the ideal termination. An analog clock works one way, with rods sweeping out circles past numbers, while a digital clock works another way, ﬂashing numbers on its screen, but we do not care: each indicates the onset and termination of the hour, and these indications are simulta- neous when we set them side by side. The universal idealized timepiece deﬁnes univer- sal events in which everything in the uni- verse participates. The change from onset to termination deﬁnes, for example, an “hour.” We conceive of everything in the universe as going through that hour. How do we in practice relate to this idealized universal event? We relate to it because the compres- sion guarantees that any local event involv- ing motion of a tolerably accurate timepiece (watch, hourglass, sun) maps on consistently to the universal idealized event. Notice that emergent in M we have uni- versal events, but neither time nor measure.\nRETHINKING METAPHOR 59 Since time is a measure of duration of events in general, M cannot give us time. It is instead a sophisticated system of emergent universal events. These universal events now have uni- versal names – hour, minute, second. E/X/M: Because M is a subset of E, it maps naturally onto E/X. This is the basis for an integration with inputs E/X on the one hand and M on the other, yielding the blended space E/X/M. In that blended space, universal events in M become particular local events in E/X. They are constrained to contain local events within their span, and any local event is contained in universal events projected from M. This gives any local event an additional dimension. Inescapably, you cannot go through the local event with- out going through the universal event that has the same beginning and end. In the emergent structure of the blended space, the universal event becomes a universal spatial length, and therefore a measure, analogous to yards, meters, and so on.7 This is why any event has a length – it is an hour long, a minute long, and so on. But, because of this containment, subjective experience of the local event is also for the experiencer experience of the projected universal event. So we can “go through an hour” just as we can go “through a lecture,” and the hour can be painful just as the lecture can be painful. Because subjective experience varies, and going through the lecture can be pleasant for you but painful for me, so now, in E/X/M, going through the hour can be pleasant for you but painful for me, or fast for you but slow for me because of the containment of the local event in the projected universal event. In M, the universal events are invari- ant. Their duration cannot vary, nor can they be painful or pleasant. But in E/X/M, those universal events become local events subjectively experienced, so they can vary according to the experience, not only for dif- ferent experiencers but also for the same experiencer, depending on circumstances: “I went through the ﬁrst hour much more quickly than the second hour.” Mastery of the full network allows simultaneous access to objective length and subjective length. “It’s amazing how the eight-hour work day is longer on Monday than it is on Friday.” We understand “the eight hours” as lying in M, where the duration is invariant but “longer” as lying in E/X/M, where it does vary; and so the statement is not self-contradictory. Crucially, blending is not algorithmic, and there are two different conventional ways to blend E/X and M. M has events (rotating rods for the clock) that we are all, within sig- niﬁcant tolerance, supposed to agree about. Subjective experience does not differ for the special kinds of events in M, and that is the main reason that they are chosen to serve in M. But in general, duration can vary in E. There is a mapping between the events in E/X and the events in M, and when we blend them, we can preserve the topology of M or the topology of E/X. If we pre- serve the topology of M in the blended space E/X/M, then we are all agreeing about the duration of the events that are correlated with the universal events. So, you ask how long it took me to go through the lecture, and I say, “It went on too long; it was an hour and ﬁve minutes long.” I am using a compressed blend E/X/M in which M topol- ogy has been projected. But I can also use the topology of duration from E/X and then in the second conventional blend, the dura- tion can vary, depending on subjective expe- rience. I can say, “Centuries.” There is hyper- bole being added, but now you know we are in the E/X/M blend dominated by the topol- ogy from E/X. Hereafter, we will label the blend domi- nated by E topology E/X/M and the blend dominated by M topology E/X/M. The full network at this point contains two crucial blended spaces, E/X/M and E/X/M, with\n60 GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER different emergent notions of time. But con- ceptually, we have the ability to manipu- late the full network with no contradiction, choosing to operate in one blend when we need subjective time and choosing to operate in the other when we need objective time. The rich conceptual notion of time as having both objective and subjective dimensions is emergent in the entire network. E/X/M has uniform durations for all experiencers: they are all on the same path because of the uni- versal event with invariant durations. But in E/X/M blends, the separate experiencers can be on different paths, with different dura- tions of traversal, as in, “Remember that vis- iting your parents goes faster for me than it does for you.” The network we just described has many spaces, multiple projections, and hyper- blends. Time in this network is not a prim- itive input but rather a notion that emerges from the full network. Once the entire net- work is achieved, it automatically contains as a by-product correspondences between time and physical space that previous anal- yses had to postulate: time and the time– space conceptual mapping are emergent in the network. 3. Duals Metaphor theory recognizes that motion of an ego through time as space has a dual, namely, time as objects moving along a path past a stationary observer. This is a valid insight, but it, too, is a consequence of emer- gence in a full integration network that we will call the dual of E/X/M. X has motion along a path. But motion is relative. Even though we know we are mov- ing relative to the sun, it looks to us as if the sun is moving relative to us. When two trains are moving side-by-side, we can easily be in one and not know which one is moving. For any scene we inhabit, we can take ourselves as a point of reference, or something else as a point of reference. If we are in fact moving down the road, and take the tree as a point of reference, then we are going by the tree. But if we are in fact moving down the road and take ourselves as the point of reference, then, relative to us, the tree is going by us. We will call the scene in which we take ourselves as the stationary point of reference “the relative motion scene.” In it, the tree is mov- ing by us. We are not deluded by this fram- ing. Relative motion is reﬂected straight- forwardly in well-known examples such as The old tollhouse went by. The rough stretch of road went by. The forest went by. In relative motion, the path and all the things along it move, relative to you. X has its relative motion counterpart, call it X’. X’ is accurately described with expressions like: That stretch of road went by effortlessly. The ﬁrst ﬁve miles went by effortlessly. By projection, the blended space E/X has its relative motion counterpart, (E/X)’. In (E/X)’, path/events move relative to the experiencer, as in: r The lecture went by effortlessly. r The party went by pleasantly. By projection, the blended space E/X/M has its relative motion counterpart, (E/X/M)’. In (E/X/M)’, the event paths also move relative to the experiencer, as in: The ﬁrst two hours went by effortlessly.\nRETHINKING METAPHOR 61 In the relative motion counterparts, rela- tive speed is preserved. If you moved slowly through an event, then in the relative motion counterpart, the event moves slowly by you. As the E/X/M blended space can be dom- inated by the topology of E or M, giving us alternatively E/X/M or E/X/M, so (E/X/M)’ can be dominated by the topology of E or M, giving alternatively (E/X/M)’ or (E/X/M)’. In (E/X/M)’, all the universal events go by the same for all the experiencers. But in (E/X/M)’, they can go by differently for dif- ferent experiencers or even for the same experiencer. So, with respect to (E/X/M)’: – Friday always goes by faster than Monday. – The hours sped by for him but dragged by for me. – It took centuries for the hour to pass. – Those three hours went by slowly for me, but the same three hours went by quickly for him. With respect to (E/X/M)’, we have expres- sions such as – Minutes go by faster than hours. – The same hour will go by whether you are suffering or having fun. In (E/X/M)’, the same hour has the same durational properties for everyone, regard- less of the events the hour contains. But in (E/X/M)’, the “same” hour can have differ- ent properties depending on the particular experiencer. Subjective experience can vary quickly for a single experiencer, vary depending on the focus, and even toggle back and forth like a Necker cube, as in the following attested piece of data: – “Time goes by really slowly. At the same time, it goes by really fast.” (CNN, said by a man waiting for word on an Ameri- can named “Michael” missing in the bomb detonations in London in July 2005.) There are many ways to take this. In one, time is going by too slowly because Michael is not showing up, but time is going by too fast because the likelihood that Michael is dead increases with every passing minute. Finally, it must be mentioned, although that is not the main focus of the present analysis, that the motion of events and times can be framed independently of an observer. This is especially true of universal times and planned events: Tuesday follows Mon- day. The lecture will be followed by a recep- tion. Moore (2007) discusses such framing in detail. N´u˜nez et al. (2006) demonstrate its psychological reality. 4. More Networks We have seen so far that analysis of metaphor requires analysis of elaborate inte- gration networks producing what can seem like straightforward mappings between two domains taken as primitives. The ultimate conceptual correspondence between time (itself emergent) and physical space is real and especially visible, but it is a ﬁnal product of emergent structure in the elaborate inte- gration network, not something to postulate as a basic primitive of human understanding. Conceptual work is never-ending, and we can continue to bring more spaces and even networks into play with the elaborate inte- gration network E/X/M. We can also use general conceptual techniques on that exist- ing network. One standard conceptual technique is to project agency into the occurrence of events, according to which, in the blend, the event is caused by the agent. In the blend with objective time (i.e., shared universal events, such as hours and minutes), all egos are con- strained to move at the same rate. If we project agency to that causal constraint, all egos are moved through the shared univer- sal events at the same rate by an agent, in this case often referred to as “Time,” or, his- torically, “the hour.” In this new blend, the emergent entity “Time” derives its motion from the network in which times move but derives its landmark from the network in which Ego moves. Importantly, this new agent is not a projection from the network of moving shared events (hours, etc.). It is not a particular hour that drives us along, but the movement of Time: “Time marches on,”\n62 GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER “Time waits for no man,” “Never fear: time will carry us along,” and, from Macbeth: Come what come may Time and the hour runs through the roughest day (Act one, scene three) Provisioned with the blend in which Time the agent moves forward through objective universal events, we can make an additional blend in which Time moving through uni- versal events is also moving through speciﬁc events that are scheduled for those univer- sal events. To say that your tooth extraction was scheduled from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. is to say that Time moved through a universal event (a particular hour) and the scheduled event simultaneously. Additionally, we can construct the blend in which Ego moves not only through uni- versal events (hours, etc.) but also actual events that correspond to the scheduled events in the schedule blend. Your actual tooth extraction corresponds to the sched- uled tooth extraction, but might actually be a shorter or a longer or an interrupted event relative to the scheduled event. Actual and scheduled event need not coincide. Accord- ingly, Time may reach the end of the sched- uled event before Ego reaches the end of the actual event. Moreover, Time may be closer to the end of the scheduled event than Ego is to the end of the actual event. In either case, Ego has fallen behind Time, when the comparison is between corresponding loca- tions on the two paths. This makes other frames, such as racing, available, as in the examples from Chapter 1 of More Than Cool Reason (Lakoff & Turner 1989) such as “We are ahead of time” and “We are racing against time.” Expressions like “Time ﬂies” or “Time stands still” can also be construed with respect to this blend, if the scheduled or expected events differ from the actual ones. Consider as an additional network that can come into play our independent integra- tion network involving memory and physi- cal space. In memory, events can be “close” or “distant,” “far apart,” “hard to access.” Relevant linguistic data indicating blends of memory and physical distance include “Call- ing up things from the depths of your mem- ory,” “Bringing a forgotten event to the sur- face.” These blends of memory and physi- cal distance can be blended with the E/X/M networks, to produce items such as – Our wedding was just yesterday. – Where have all those years disappeared? – The days of my youth are so close yet so far away. For purposes of terminology, we will refer to the blend of memory and physical space as R/S (for Recall/Space). When we blend E/X/M with R/S, we get a new integration E/X/M/R/S, which puts a metric on mem- ory that uses the notion of time that is emer- gent in the E/X/M networks. The subjec- tive feeling in R/S that the wedding is very accessible, very close, is mapped onto the subjective feeling about the events of yester- day. So the blend endows R/S with a met- ric using the notion of time. Accordingly, in the E/X/M/R/S blend, the word “yester- day” provides an adequate indication of dis- tance in memory. So in E/X/M, our wed- ding was not yesterday (assuming it was 18 years ago). But the memory of the wed- ding as experienced in R projects to yester- day in E/X/M/R/S, where the wedding of 18 years ago can now be “yesterday.” In this case, the ordering topology of R/S dominates over the ordering topology in any version of E/X/M. Now consider “Where have all those years disappeared?” Consider the reading in which this means that the speaker cannot remem- ber the events over several years. The events in memory are gone, they map to corre- sponding years in E/X/M, and, accordingly, the years themselves are gone. But consider the alternative reading in which the speaker says, “My wedding was just yesterday. Where have all those years disappeared?” It is inde- pendently acknowledged that the objec- tive distance of the wedding in E/X/M is 18 years. There is a clash between the con- ﬁguration in E/X/M and the conﬁguration in E/X/M/R/S. If the wedding was just yes- terday in E/X/M/R/S (subjective memory with a time–space–motion structure), then\nRETHINKING METAPHOR 63 there is no space for the 18 years that are right there in E/X/M (objective event real- ity with a time–space–motion structure), and those years must have disappeared. In this integration, subjective memory wins out over objective reality. Instead of objec- tive reality’s indicating that your memory is faulty, memory shows that the years must be missing. If the reasoning is carried out in objective reality, then we have examples such as “My wedding seems like just yes- terday. I must be losing it (on drugs, have Alzheimer’s).” In that case, objective real- ity wins over subjective memory. Exam- ples such as “Where have all those years disappeared?” and others below show that when different mental spaces are built in which there are clashes, then reasoning can follow about that clash. Reasoning can be conducted in one or another of the mental spaces. Take the variant, “My wedding seems like yesterday. The years have really gone by fast.” Again, the clash is between distance in subjective memory and objective real- ity. The reasoning is a very standard pattern imported from ordinary motion and speed in physical space. If the train departs city A and you are in city B before you know it, you can conclude either that B is close to A or that the train travels very fast. Then if you thought that A was close to B, and you are told that in reality it is far from B, you are forced to conclude that the train trav- eled fast. So in the same way, if your sub- jective memory tells you that your wedding and today are close, but reality informs you that they are in fact far apart, then you can resolve the clash by concluding that moving objects (here, times) have traveled fast. But notice that variable speed of time is not a property within (E/X/M)’ (invari- ant universal time events) or within (E/X/M/R/S)’ (relative distance of events in memory). Variable speed of time is a property within (E/X/M)’, the subjective construction of time. The reasoning that years must have gone by fast resolves the clash between subjective memory and objec- tive reality by inferring a greater speed in (E/X/M)’. Time can ﬂy, race, drag, or come to a com- plete halt, as in “time stands still” or “time froze.” In all these cases, we need to be oper- ating in more than one mental space, and there is some kind of clash between subjec- tive experience and objective reality. For all of them, we can focus on (E/X/M)’ in order to resolve the clash. For example, if I think it is Saturday, and I realize that it is really Mon- day, then the clash is resolved in (E/X/M)’ by assuming that the days must have traveled fast, and I can say, “Time ﬂies.” Other domains are covertly involved in such networks. Expectations are run paral- lel to experience, and they can clash for all kinds of reasons. An extreme case is when we say, “Time has frozen” or “come to a halt.” We expected or desired events to be tak- ing place, but their onset has not occurred. In (E/X/M)’, times and events are blended and move together. Events not happening is the same as events not moving, and accord- ingly subjective time is not moving. The feel- ing can have many different causes. Sup- pose we are watching a play whose script we know well. At one point, an actor fails to deliver his line, either because he has for- gotten or tripped and needs to regain bal- ance. Of course, events are going on, but not the expected events, and the expected events will take place, just not when we expected them. The delay between expec- tation and reality can be solved by recruiting from (E/X/M)’ a variable speed for time of zero. “Time froze while he tried to remem- ber his line.” 5. Cobbling and Sculpting Nathaniel Smith notes the following passage in a novel: Remarkable – when I am sitting on a cushion on the ﬂoor, busy with scissors and glue pot, the time just vanishes. Before I know it the latticed rectangle of pale autumn sunlight has moved from the left wall across the ﬂoor to the other wall and Mrs. O’Carolan is calling\n64 GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER me for supper. Perhaps time is ﬂowing faster up there in the attic. Perhaps the accumulated mass of the past gath- ered there is pulling time out of the future faster, like a weight on a line. Or perhaps, more mundanely, it is only that I am getting older every year and that it is the accumulated weight of time behind me that is unreeling the years with ever-increasing speed. What a hor- rible thing it must be to grow older and ﬁnd that ever-decreasing num- ber of years hurrying you faster, faster toward your grave, as if time were impatient to be rid of you. (Ian McDonald, “Emily’s Diary, Novem- ber 5, 1913,” in King of Morning, Queen of Day, pp. 82–83.) Although this may seem fanciful, it is eas- ily understood exactly because it is exploit- ing the network for time that we have dis- cussed. A phrase such as “time just vanishes” is standard and idiomatic, and, as we saw, a result of resolving a clash between subjec- tive experience and shared universal events. The pale autumn sunlight’s moving across the room is a local timepiece that can be put into registration with other timepieces. As in the general case, subjective feelings of dura- tion are blended with speed of motion. But now, the question arises, why would time be operating this way? The answer, again a standard derivative of the standard network, is that time has a variable speed, and now a new blend is constructed according to which that motion is induced by standard physics. Weight is pulling the timeline along. Inter- estingly, this still preserves the registration of the timepieces. Even though the subjec- tive speed of time when you are doing cer- tain things in the attic is much greater than the subjective speed of time in the kitchen, the time in the attic will match the time in the kitchen whenever you go to the bother of checking because that is a property of E/X/M. This network allows us to get to a point with different speeds at different spots in the network, but the points will match with M. The additional blending of “pulling time” is simply opportunistically exploiting a connection between objects and weight and the fact that if you have more objects, you have more weight. The mass in the past is picking out events in the subjective space. This subjective space is much fuller of events from the past when you are in the attic, among all those souvenirs, than it is in the kitchen, where you are engaged in cooking sausage to eat immediately. So when you go down to the kitchen, your subjective space changes, and the weight of the past dimin- ishes with each step as you go down, so by the time you get to the kitchen, time is run- ning at its usual pace, no longer being pulled precipitously along. The variant of years being pulled faster for older people because of the greater time behind them is another way of resolving the clash by blending the subjective space in (E/X/M)’ with a concrete frame of the pull of gravity. In the new blend, the “time objects” are linked and the increasing weight of those behind pulls the present and future ones ever faster. It exploits the fact that in (E/X/M)’, we know that the objects move differently for different experiencers. Spectacularly, in fact, in the last variant, it follows that a small number of years is now moving ever faster past you. In the relative motion dual of this scene, you are therefore moving faster toward the end, the grave. At this point, there is a blend with intention- ality. How does this feel? Now subjective experience is restructured again to include desire for the speed on the part of time, and the cause of Time’s increasing the speed is its impatience to get rid of you, that is, to bring you to your end. Conclusion Metaphoric mappings, theory of metaphor, and metaphor analysis need to be revised to include permanent features of cognition: – Integration networks – Cobbling and sculpting – Emergent structure\nRETHINKING METAPHOR 65 Figure 3.2. Integration network for time as space, including dual. – Compression – Overarching goals other than projection of inference. We have shown in some detail, with TIME AS SPACE, how to go about this revised and deeper form of metaphorical analysis, taking into account the aforementioned properties of cognition. As far as we can tell, the consid- erations we adduced apply quite generally to any metaphorical analysis. The message for all of us metaphor theorists is that we need to go far beyond the usual focus on cross- domain mapping and inference transfer. We need to face squarely the far greater com- plexity of integrations that lie behind observ- able metaphorical conceptual systems. We need to take into account their cultural his- tory, and we need to account explicitly for the emergent structures they produce, both over cultural time and over individual time (a child’s learning of the elaborate intercon- nected integration networks). In the early days of contemporary linguistics, the realiza- tion that children mastered stunningly com- plex syntactic and phonological structures was often met with disbelief: how could tod- dlers possibly know so much? We know bet- ter today: the child’s cognitive brain leaves in the dust our most powerful computers. So there is nothing surprising in the discovery that meaning construction is also supported and effected by highly elaborate dynamic systems. The challenge for the analyst is to delve rigorously into these remarkable con- structions of the mind. The permanent features of cognition that we have drawn attention to in the present work are part of metaphor because metaphor itself is one particularly impor- tant and salient manifestation of concep- tual integration. Double-scope integration, which typically exploits clashes, is the hall- mark of cognitively modern human beings. And metaphor is one of its most powerful products, one that often drives key aspects of art, science, religion, and technology.

This is coin- cidence of local events. To say that something is a meter long is to fuse the local with the uni- versal. In the space of physical space, before you had the universal yardstick, let’s say, all you could do is compare: this is longer than that. Once you have a universal yardstick, now everything has a length. There is now a universal stuff (of course, this is an emergent concept) just as there are universal events. The meter is made out of universal stuff con- ceptually, just as the hour is a universal event.

[because they] . . . often talk using metaphor, such as he was the apple of her eye, we had a real pig of a day, they had a skeleton in the cup- board. I think it [metaphor] should be called a lie because a pig is not a day and people do not have skeletons in their cupboards and . . . imagining an apple in someone’s eye doesn’t have anything to do with liking someone a lot . . .” (Haddon, 2003, p. 15). So claims Christopher Boone, the protagonist in Had- don’s perceptive and riotously funny novel about an autistic teenager trying to ﬁgure out the world around him. Like metaphor theorists from Aristotle to contemporary philosophical, linguistic, and psycholinguistic writers (cf. Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Fogelin, 1988; Searle, 1979), metaphors such as Sam is a pig are consid- ered to be false categorical assertions, and so must be treated as similes (e.g., Sam is like a pig) in order to be understood. A pref- erence for simile over metaphor is clearly endorsed by our autistic savant Christopher, who, referring to a neighbor whom he dis- likes intensely, observes, “He had a very hairy nose. It looked like there were two very small mice hiding in his nostrils. This is not a metaphor, it is a simile, which means that it really did look like there were two very small mice hiding in his nostrils. And a simile is not a lie, unless it is a bad simile” (Haddon, 2003 p. 17). In these few lines, Christopher Boone neatly captures the traditional pragmatic view of metaphor comprehension. Nominal metaphors such as my lawyer is a shark or my surgeon was a butcher are taken to be liter- ally false. Literally false assertions are consid- ered to be infelicitous because they violate one of Grice’s (1975) conversational max- ims, namely, to be truthful. As such, they are defective if taken literally because they do not make sense in the context of the utterance. Therefore, a hearer or reader must search for a nonliteral meaning that does make sense. Understanding nonliteral mean- ings thus requires three distinct processing stages: 1. Derive the literal meaning of the utter- ance. 2. Assess the interpretability of that mean- ing in the utterance context. 67\n68 SAM GLUCKSBERG 3. If the literal meaning does not make sense in context, then search for a non- literal meaning that does. As Searle (1979) put it, “Where an utter- ance is defective if taken literally, look for an utterance meaning that differs from sen- tence meaning” (p. 114). Applying this gen- eral model to how people understand nom- inal metaphors, we have the comparison model of metaphor comprehension. Nom- inal metaphors such as some roads are snakes or my job is a jail are “defective” in that they are literally false. One way to deal with this problem would be to convert a literally false categorical assertion into a true com- parison assertion, that is, a simile. Similes are always literally true because any two things must always be alike in one way or another, indeed, in an indeterminate number of ways. This move produces the standard pragmatic model of metaphor comprehen- sion. According to this model, metaphors are considered to be implicit similes. When a statement of the form X is a Y is literally false, then it is converted into a true simile, X is like a Y, and then treated exactly as any literal comparison (see Gentner, 1983). This general comparison view has three important, testable psychological implica- tions. First, literal meanings have uncondi- tional processing priority. Literal meanings are always computed ﬁrst and are com- puted unconditionally. Nonliteral meanings are never computed until literal meanings are computed and found to be “defective” – they do not make sense in context. Literally intended language should thus be easier to understand and should also take less time to compute than nonliterally intended lan- guage. In addition, nonliteral meaning com- putation is optional: nonliteral meanings are sought only if the literal meaning is uninter- pretable. Thus, unless literal meanings won’t work, nonliteral meanings are ignored. A second implication of this view is that comparisons are easy to understand, whether they are literal or metaphorical. But, how do people solve the compari- son problem? Since any two things can be alike in innumerable ways, how do we iden- tify precisely those ways that are intended? Consider the old adage about inappropri- ate comparisons: they are characterized as comparing apples and oranges, reﬂecting a belief that one can’t (or at least shouldn’t) compare apples and oranges. A moment’s reﬂection reveals that apples and oranges can indeed be compared and that they share many, many properties: both are edible, have a warm color, round shape, similar in size, contain seeds, grow on trees, good for mak- ing juice, names begin with a vowel, and they are unsuitable as balls in such games as ten- nis, ﬁeld hockey, or baseball. Clearly, solv- ing the comparison problem requires more than an exhaustive search for shared fea- tures or properties. Substituting a simile for a metaphor obviously doesn’t automatically solve the comprehension problem. A third implication of the comparison view is that metaphors and similes are, to all intents and purposes, interchangeable. Metaphoric assertions can be put in either of the two forms, X is a Y or X is like a Y. Are these two forms used to express the same meanings, or can their meanings differ sys- tematically? These three implications have been empirically tested, and all three turn out to be false. Instead, the following three generalizations characterize metaphor comprehension: 1. Literal meanings do not have uncondi- tional priority, and so they are not neces- sarily easier to compute than nonliteral meanings. More importantly, metaphor comprehension is not optional; it does not depend on the defectiveness of literal meanings. Instead, metaphor comprehension is mandatory, that is, automatic. Whether or not a literal meaning makes sense in context, poten- tial metaphorical meanings cannot be ignored. 2. Metaphors are rarely understood via comparison. Instead, they are usually understood exactly as they appear, as class-inclusion assertions. When some- one says that their surgeon was a butcher, that is what they intend: that\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 69 their surgeon belongs to a category of persons who are butchers in one way or another. 3. Metaphors and similes are not inter- changeable. These two forms express different meanings, sometimes sub- tly different, sometimes signiﬁcantly so. Furthermore, the differences between similes and their correspond- ing metaphors are systematic and can be accounted for in a principled, theoretically coherent way. The central idea is that metaphors are cat- egorical, class-inclusion assertions. For con- ventional metaphors, the category preexists; it had been established when the metaphor was ﬁrst coined. For novel metaphors, a cat- egory is created and the metaphor vehicle serves as the name of that category.1 We will examine these ideas in detail. We turn now to the ﬁrst issue: are literal meanings privi- leged vis-`a-vis metaphorical ones? Priority of the Literal The priority of the literal takes two forms: relative ease of processing and uncondi- tional temporal-order priority. With respect to relative ease of processing, the long- standing assumption that literally intended utterances are understood more easily than those intended nonliterally can be easily rejected. At one extreme, familiar idioms are no more difﬁcult to understand than their literal counterparts. Indeed, the idiomatic meanings of expressions such as “kick the bucket” are understood more rapidly than their literal meanings (to die versus strike a pail with one’s foot (Gibbs, Nayak, & Cut- ting, 1989; see also Giora, 2003, on the issue of graded salience). This is not at all surprising, given that such expressions can be stored in a phrasal lexicon along with other familiar expressions such as clich´es, song titles, lines of poetry, and the like (see Jackendoff, 1995). Understanding famil- iar idioms may thus be very much like understanding individual lexical items, via direct access. More surprising, perhaps, is that even novel metaphors can be under- stood as rapidly as comparable literal expres- sions, provided that the novel metaphors are apt (Blasko & Connine, 1993). It seems that given a linguistic input, literal and ﬁgurative meanings, where available, are computed in parallel, even in the absence of contextual supports (McElree & Nordlie, 1999). Con- sistent with these behavioral studies, stud- ies using brain-recording (e.g., event-related potential patterns) and brain-imaging tech- niques (e.g., fMRI) ﬁnd little evidence for differences in brain area activation patterns for literal versus metaphoric language pro- cessing (Ahrens, 2004; Pynte et al., 1996; Rapp et al., 2007; but see Stringaris et al., 2007). If literal and ﬁgurative meanings are com- puted in parallel and engage the same brain areas for processing, then the second literal- priority assumption – that nonliteral mean- ing computation is optional – is also sus- pect. We know that people cannot refuse to understand literal language. Instead, under- standing “occurs automatically without con- scious control by the listener . . . loss of control over one’s language comprehension device may correspond to knowing a lan- guage ﬂuently” (Miller & Johnson-Laird, 1976, p. 166). Linguistic input automatically triggers semantic and syntactic analyses that generate literal sentence meaning (Fodor, 1983). Could those processes and analyses that generate metaphorical meanings also be automatically triggered by linguistic input? Just as people cannot ignore literal mean- ings, people cannot ignore metaphorical meanings. A classic demonstration of the automaticity of literal language process- ing was provided by Stroop (1935), via the eponymous Stroop interference effect. Stroop had people attend to individual color words such as red, yellow, or green. These words were printed in various col- ors, and Stroop instructed his participants to ignore the words themselves, but instead to name the color of the ink that the words were printed in. When ink color and color name matched, people could respond quickly and accurately. When, however, they mismatched, as when the word “red” was\n70 SAM GLUCKSBERG printed in green ink, the response of say- ing “green” was signiﬁcantly delayed. What has come to be known as Stroop interference demonstrated that ﬂuent readers could not ignore word meanings. A version of Stroop’s paradigm provides an analogous demonstration that people can- not ignore metaphorical meanings. Glucks- berg, Gildea, and Bookin (1982) asked peo- ple to read sentences and to judge whether they were literally true or false. Most of the sentences were nonproblematic: they were clearly either true or false; for exam- ple, “some birds are robins” is unambigu- ously true, “some birds are tables” is unam- biguously false. However, a sentence such as “some birds are ﬂutes,” while literally false, has some metaphorical truth to it. Just as the word “red” printed in green ink produces response conﬂict, a literally false sentence that is metaphorically “true” should also pro- duce response conﬂict if, indeed, people can- not ignore metaphors. And that is exactly what happened. People fell prey to the clas- sic Stroop interference with literally false but metaphorically true sentences: they took sig- niﬁcantly longer to correctly respond “false” to these kinds of sentences than to unam- biguously false literal sentences (for repli- cations and extensions of these results, see Blasko, 2004; Gildea, & Glucksberg, 1983; Keysar, 1989). The priority of the literal also fails when people interpret noun–noun combinations such as shark lawyer or steel arms. Each of these phrases can be interpreted either lit- erally or metaphorically. For example, shark lawyer can refer to a lawyer who represents an environmental group dedicated to pro- tecting rare species of sharks from extinction or to a lawyer who is predatory and aggres- sive, as in “my lawyer is a shark.” Similarly, steel arms can refer to arms that are made of steel (as in a machine of some sort or a robot) or to human arms that are strong (metaphor- ically, arms as strong and hard as steel). In neither of these two cases are literal mean- ings in any way “defective,” and so if literal meanings do have priority, then they should be the preferred interpretations. However, if metaphorical meanings are generated as automatically as literal ones, then we would expect people to opt for metaphorical mean- ings at least as often as literal ones. Gold- varg and Glucksberg (1998) gave people two types of noun–noun combinations: those that could only be paraphrased literally, and those that could be paraphrased both lit- erally and metaphorically. For the literal- only items, 82% of the interpretations were unambiguously literal. In contrast, for the items that could be paraphrased either literally or metaphorically, 75% of the inter- pretations were metaphorical. The over- whelming preference for metaphorical inter- pretation, even when the literal is perfectly acceptable, is clearly inconsistent with the assumption of literal priority. Even when metaphors are in the implicit form of a noun–noun combination, metaphorical meanings cannot be ignored. Conclusions on the Priority of the Literal a. Speed of processing: metaphorical and literal meanings are processed equally quickly.2 b. Temporal priority: metaphorical and lit- eral meanings are processed in parallel, with neither having unconditional prior- ity. c. Automaticity: Neither literal nor metaphorical meanings can be ignored. When either is available, then they are processed. In some circumstances, when both are available, metaphorical meanings may be preferred to literal (in Giora’s terms [2003], they may be more salient than the literal). Understanding Metaphors: A Comparison Process? Understanding Comparisons People can understand literal comparisons in at least two ways. One way would be via feature matching. The properties of the two terms of a comparison are extracted and are then matched with one another. Those prop- erties that are in common to the two, as well as those that are not in common, are then used to establish the ground for the com- parison, as well as the degree of similarity\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 71 of the two concepts (cf. Gentner & Mark- man, 1994; Tversky, 1977). An alternative strategy can be used instead of property extraction and matching. Instead of match- ing the properties of the two concepts, one can identify the closest superordinate cat- egory that encompasses the two concepts and then use that category’s properties as the ground for the comparison. This latter strategy is the one used in the similari- ties subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelli- gence Scale (Wechsler, 1958). The similar- ities subscale contains items such as “How are oranges and lemons alike?” The correct answer, provided in the test manual, is “both are citrus fruits.” This category’s properties constitute the ways in which oranges and lemons are alike: they have the same kind of skin, seeds, acidic juice, and so on. The items increase in difﬁculty as the superordi- nate category becomes increasingly abstract, for example, “How are oranges and insects alike?” One answer: both are organic. These two approaches to understanding literal comparisons are also applicable to understanding metaphoric comparisons, or similes. For example, one can try to under- stand how lawyers and sharks are alike by matching the properties of lawyers and of sharks, as proposed by comparison theorists such as Gentner and her colleagues (e.g., Gentner & Wolff, 1997). Alternatively, one can use the categorical approach and seek the closest category that encompasses the two concepts, lawyer and shark. One answer to the question of how lawyers and sharks are alike is both are “sharks.” In what sense can such a category be identiﬁed as “Sharks”? Understanding Metaphors: Dual Reference Just as any two concepts or objects can be alike in innumerable ways, so can any two concepts or objects belong to innumerable different categories. Consider three objects: Tuna, Shark, and My lawyer. Tuna and Shark are both ﬁsh, and they are also both foods. Neither of these categories seem applicable to “my lawyer,” but sharks and lawyers can both belong to the category of predators, that is, creatures that are vicious, aggressive, FOOD FISH PRED A T O R vicious , ag resiv e, merciles , etc…. TUNA SHARK MY LA WYER Figure 4.1a. Cross-categorization of Lawyer and Shark. and merciless (see Figure 4.1a). How shall we call that category? One viable option is to use the name of a stereotypical member of the category of predators as the name of the cat- egory itself, namely, “Shark.” The metaphor vehicle, “Shark,” refers to a type, or category of thing. In contrast, when it is used literally, it refers to one member of that category, the marine animal “shark.” In this way, the term “shark” has dual reference. When used in metaphor form, it refers to the category of predators that we can call “Sharks.” When used in simile form, it refers to the literal shark. As Roger Brown put it some years ago, “Metaphor dif- fers from other superordinate-subordinate relations in that the superordinate is not given a name of its own. Instead, the name of one subordinate (i.e., the metaphor vehi- cle) is extended to the other” (Brown, 1958, p. 140). Thus, in expressions such as My job is a jail, the term “jail” refers to a category of unpleasant, conﬁning, difﬁcult to get out of, punishing situations that the literal jail exempliﬁes. Both my job and jail now belong to the metaphorical category “Jails.” Dual reference is not an exotic lin- guistic strategy that is exclusive to ﬁgu- rative language. Instead, it is a common, FOOD FISH SHARK vicious , ag resiv e, merciles , etc…. TUNA SHARK MY LA WYER “Shark” used as a metaphor vehicle refers to a category of things, whereas used literally it refers to a specific member of that category. Figure 4.1b. Cross-categorization of Lawyer and Shark.\n72 SAM GLUCKSBERG everyday referring strategy whenever a lan- guage community lacks a name for a superor- dinate category, yet needs a referring expres- sion for that category. For example, this strategy is exploited by speakers of classiﬁer languages, languages that generally do not have names for superordinate categories. Some of the Native American languages of southwest United States are classiﬁer lan- guages and employ this strategy. In Hopi, for example, the most typical tree is the cot- tonwood, and so the name for the cotton- wood tree is used to refer to trees in general (Trager, 1936–1939). When speakers wish to distinguish between cottonwood and other kinds of trees, they use real-cottonwood for that speciﬁc tree and cottonwood for the oth- ers. Similarly, Shoshoni speakers use eagle for all large birds of prey (Hage & Miller, 1976) unless they wish to distinguish between eagles and other large birds, in which case they use real-eagle for that speciﬁc bird. In languages that generally have lexical items for superordinate categories, the same dual reference strategy can be used when a novel category is created but has yet to be named. Indeed, the use of a dual-referring expression may well create that category, as when we ﬁrst use a term for a speciﬁc refer- ent to refer generically to the category that the referent exempliﬁes. Examples abound: Kleenex for facial tissues in general, Xerox for dry-paper copying machines, Jell-O for gelatin desserts, and Jeep for all-purpose four-wheel drive vehicles (derived originally from the military term General Purpose, or GP, vehicle). In some cases, nouns used in this way can also be used as verbs, as in Xerox- ing documents, or, in England, Hoovering to refer to the act of vacuuming with, of course, a Hoover vacuum cleaner. Metaphoric categories can be named and created in precisely this way. It took less than a journalist’s day for the term “Enron” to be used to refer to a newly created category, the set of stunningly scandalous corporate accounting schemes that fraudu- lently enrich upper-echelon management while incurring stockholder and employee losses of unprecedented magnitude. Is it any wonder that people latched on to a single term, “Enron,” to simultaneously create and name that category, as in, “who will be the next Enron”? In most cases, the dual reference of such terms as “Kleenex” or “Enron” goes unnoticed, so natural is this discourse strat- egy. In some expressions, however, the dual reference function is transparent, as in “boys will be boys,” where the ﬁrst use of the word “boys” refers literally to young human males and the second to the category young human males who behave in boisterous and often offensive ways. Similarly, when Cam- bodia misguidedly invaded Vietnam several decades ago, the disastrous military venture was referred to as “Cambodia has become Vietnam’s Vietnam.” Here, the ﬁrst men- tion of Vietnam referred, metonymically, to that country’s government and military, while the second referred to the category of disastrous military ventures that Viet- nam had come to symbolize to America and the rest of the world. Exactly this strat- egy was used when a civil-rights lawyer expressed concern for the Florida voting pro- cess in the 2004 presidential election. Vot- ing records had disappeared after computer systems crashed after a primary election in Miami-Dade County, where votes had been disputed in the 2000 presidential election. Said the chair of the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, “This shows that unless we do something now – Florida is headed toward being the next Florida” (Goodnough, 2004). We can now understand what I like to call the paradox of unlike things com- pared. Literal comparison assertions com- pare two “like” things: two things that belong to the same taxonomic category, as in coffee is like tea. Such comparisons can- not be paraphrased as categorical assertions because they are inevitably false: to say that coffee IS tea doesn’t make much sense (unless intended metaphorically!). In con- trast, metaphoric comparisons – that is, sim- iles – can usually be so paraphrased. Con- sider the simile my lawyer is like a shark. This assertion compares two “unlike” things, that is, two things from widely disparate categories, professional people and ﬁsh.\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 73 Metaphorical Shark Vicious Predatory Aggressive Tenacious Merciless etc. Literal Shark Vicious Predatory Aggressive Tenacious Merciless Can Swim Has Fins, Sharp teeth, Leathery skin, Gills……… Figure 4.2. Hypothetical vehicle properties. Nevertheless, it can be paraphrased as a cat- egorical assertion, my lawyer IS a shark.3 The property of similes and their corre- sponding metaphors that makes such para- phrases acceptable is the dual reference function of the metaphor vehicle. In the lawyer–shark example, the term “shark” refers at two different levels of abstraction, in the simile versus the metaphorical. In the simile, the term “shark” refers at a basic level of abstraction, the ﬁsh that lurks beneath the ocean waves. This is the literal shark, with properties such as vicious, predatory, and aggressive but also having ﬁns, gills, and leathery skin (see Figure 4.2). In the metaphor, the term “shark” refers at a higher level of abstraction, the category of creatures that the literal shark exempliﬁes. Among the properties of this category are vicious, preda- tory, and aggressive but not properties of lit- eral sharks such as having ﬁns, gills, or leath- ery skin.4 Implications of Dual Reference for Understanding Metaphors and Similes Because the metaphor vehicle and the predi- cate of the simile refer to different entities – the categorical and the speciﬁc basic-level concept, respectively – both the process and product of comprehending the two forms should differ systematically. Three phenom- ena reﬂect the differences between under- standing metaphors and understanding their corresponding similes: 1. Relative ease of understanding the two forms. 2. Effects of highlighting the literal versus metaphorical referents of the metaphor vehicle. 3. Systematic differences in how the two forms are interpreted.5 Ease of understanding. In similes, the predi- cate of the comparison refers directly to the literal exemplar of the metaphorical cate- gory, e.g., the ﬁsh “shark” as an exemplar of the metaphorical category of “sharks.” For familiar metaphors and similes, there should be little if any difference in comprehension time because the work of sorting out the relevant from the irrelevant properties of the simile’s predicate has already been done. Presumably, metaphor-irrelevant properties of sharks, such as having gills and leath- ery skin, can be swiftly rejected when we encounter similes such as “my lawyer was like a shark.” However, for relatively unfa- miliar similes and metaphors, similes should require more interpretative work because they would tend to evoke both metaphor- relevant and metaphor-irrelevant – that is literal – properties. In contrast, metaphors, because they refer directly at the categor- ical level, should evoke only properties of the category, not those of a category’s lit- eral exemplars. This argument applies, of course only to apt metaphors, metaphors that employ an easily recognizable proto- typical exemplar of a candidate metaphori- cal category. Metaphors such as “Enron” and “Florida” in appropriate contexts typify such categories. Others clearly do not. For exam- ple, their love was a ﬁling cabinet would not be easily and categorically understood because ﬁling cabinets do not exemplify any readily recognizable metaphoric categories. In such cases, people might well need to resort to a comparison strategy, considering proper- ties of ﬁling cabinets that might plausibly apply to romantic relationships. And peo- ple often succeed, but only with effort, in this case coming up with candidate prop- erties of ﬁling cabinets such as holds mem- ories, cold and routine, and cluttered and old.\n74 SAM GLUCKSBERG For more apt metaphors, the data are sparse, but support the processing advan- tage of metaphors over similes. In one par- ticularly telling study, Johnson (1996) had people read short paragraphs that ended in either a metaphor or a corresponding simile. People took less time integrating metaphors into the preceding text than their corre- sponding similes, suggesting that, indeed, metaphors are easier to process than simi- les. This is clearly inconsistent with the tra- ditional notion that metaphors are under- stood by ﬁrst transforming them into similes. Instead, they seem to be understood in their own right: as categorical assertions. Highlighting the literal versus the metaphor- ical. If metaphor vehicles refer to abstract superordinate categories, then calling atten- tion to the basic-level literal meaning of a metaphor vehicle should make comprehen- sion more difﬁcult. However, priming the literal meaning of a metaphor topic should have no deleterious effect because the topic is used literally. We tested this prediction by priming metaphors either with an irrelevant literal property of the topic, or an irrele- vant literal property of the vehicle. People read metaphors such as my lawyer was a shark, preceded by (a) neutral control sen- tences, such as some tables are made of wood, (b) irrelevant topic-property sentences, such as some lawyers are married, and c) irrel- evant vehicle-property sentences, such as sharks can swim. People needed more time to understand the metaphor when it was preceded by the sharks-swim sentence than when it was preceded by either the neu- tral control or the irrelevant topic-property sentences (Glucksberg, McGlone, & Man- fredi 1997; McGlone & Manfredi, 20026). Apparently, calling attention to the basic- level, concrete referent of a metaphor vehi- cle interferes with its intended function, that is, reference to the corresponding superordi- nate metaphorical category. If metaphor vehicles do refer to superor- dinate categories and not to their basic-level exemplars, then understanding a metaphor should be comparable to understanding any ambiguous utterance. When people under- stand homonyms in context, such as the word bank in the context of money, then the contextually inappropriate meanings of the word – such as “riverbank” – are inhib- ited (Simpson & Kang, 1994). If under- standing a metaphor also involves activat- ing appropriate meanings and inhibiting inappropriate ones, then understanding a metaphor should involve inhibiting the basic-level, literal meaning of the metaphor vehicle. Gernsbacher, Keysar, Robertson, and Werner (2001) asked people to read either metaphors, such as my lawyer was a shark, or literal statements, such as the hammerhead is a shark, and then to ver- ify statements related to the literal meaning of the metaphor vehicle, such as sharks are good swimmers. People were much slower to verify literal property statements following metaphors than following literal assertions, suggesting that literal meanings of metaphor vehicles are inhibited during metaphor com- prehension. We replicated this ﬁnding and, in addition, demonstrated that the effect is due to active inhibition of irrelevant, lit- eral meanings, not just to strategic retrieval strategies (Glucksberg, Newsome, & Gold- varg, 2001). In this respect, metaphor com- prehension involves the same comprehen- sion mechanisms that are used for literal language comprehension (see, for example, Gernsbacher & Faust, 1991). Metaphors Are Not Similes UNDERSTANDING METAPHORS VERSUS UNDERSTANDING SIMILES A basic assumption underlying virtually all theories of metaphor is that metaphors and similes are, fundamentally, equivalent: they mean the same thing. This assumption is shared not only by comparison theorists, who hold that metaphors are fundamen- tally comparisons and processed as such, but also by categorization theorists. Compari- son theorists such as Gentner and her col- leagues, for example, argue that any given metaphor can be understood either as a sim- ile, that is, a comparison assertion, or as a categorization, that is, a class inclusion assertion. They argue further that whether a metaphor is understood as a comparison or\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 75 as a categorization assertion depends on its familiarity. Novel metaphors are invariably understood as comparisons. With repeated use, metaphors become conventionalized and can then be understood as categorization assertions and processed as such. They refer to this argument as the career-of-metaphor hypothesis. (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005). This view obviously depends critically on the assumption that metaphors and their corre- sponding similes mean the same thing. Categorization theorists rely just as crit- ically on this assumption, that metaphors and similes are virtual paraphrases of one another. Whereas comparison theo- rists argue that metaphors are understood as implicit similes, categorization theorists argue that the opposite is true: that simi- les are understood as implicit categorization assertions. Metaphors are not understood by transforming them into similes. Instead, they are intended as class-inclusion state- ments and are understood as such. When metaphors are expressed as comparisons, then they are interpreted as implicit cate- gory statements, rather than the other way around (Glucksberg, 2001; Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990). Recent evidence on how peo- ple understand metaphors and their corre- sponding similes suggest that both compar- ison and categorization theories are wrong in this respect. Metaphors and similes differ systematically, and so neither can be inter- preted in terms of the other. Consider, ﬁrst, how people interpret metaphors and their corresponding sim- iles. Ostensibly, metaphors and similes should yield comparable interpretations, with metaphors, perhaps, being somehow more “vivid” (Ortony, 1979). We tested this notion directly, by asking people to paraphrase either metaphors or their cor- responding similes. Half the participants in this experiment paraphrased metaphors, the other half similes. For the expression some ideas are like diamonds, typical paraphrases included responses such as some ideas are rare and desirable, some ideas are so inter- esting it is as though they shine and glitter, and some ideas are very valuable. The ital- icized properties that were attributed to some ideas – rare, desirable, shine, glitter, valuable – are all properties of the literal dia- mond. This suggests that the predicate of a simile does indeed refer directly to the basic- level concept, in this case the literal gem, a diamond. In contrast, metaphors tended to attribute emergent properties to the topic, properties that inhere in the superordinate category of diamonds as valuable entities but not to literal diamonds. Typical paraphrases of this kind were some ideas are brilliant and insightful and some ideas are fantastic and cre- atively very unique. Clearly, literal diamonds cannot be insightful, and “creatively very unique” seems a stretch. Overall, metaphors tended to be interpreted in this way, with many more nonliteral, emergent attributions than literal, basic-level ones. Similes tended to attribute about an equal number of each (Hasson, Estes, & Glucksberg, 2001; see Figure 4.3). Clearly, metaphors are not just more vivid than similes. Instead, they tend to evoke more emergent properties than do similes. As Richard Russo wrote in his satiri- cal novel of academic life, metaphors are not similes: Sophomoric Student: “I like the clouds . . . They’re, like, a metaphor.” Sarcastic Professor: “They are a metaphor . . . if they were like a metaphor, they’d be, like, a simile.” (Russo, 1997) Although these data clearly show that metaphors and their corresponding simi- les may differ in their interpretations, the case may still be made that these differ- ences are rather subtle and could well be produced by inferences drawn after ini- tial comprehension. If this is so, then the career-of-metaphor hypothesis might still hold. Novel metaphors would be under- stood via a comparison process and so would not differ in interpretations from their cor- responding similes. Conventional matters might be understood via a categorization operation, and be understood slightly dif- ferently from their corresponding similes via postcomprehension inferences. In order to reject both the career-of-metaphor as well as the categorization views that treat metaphors and similes as equivalent, we\n76 SAM GLUCKSBERG 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 metaphor s imile Trope Form Attributions (Mean) Emergent Liter al Figure 4.3. Mean number of emergent and literal attributions as a function of trope form. need to show two things. First, that novel metaphors, not just conventional ones, can be privileged when in metaphor rather than in simile form. This would directly contra- dict the career-of-metaphor view, that novel metaphors are understood as comparisons, not as categorization assertions. Second, we need to show that novel metaphors and their corresponding similes can differ sharply in their interpretations. This would contradict the career-of-metaphor argument that novel metaphors are understood as implicit com- parisons, that is, similes. On the other side of the coin, it would also contradict Glucks- berg and Keysar’s (1990) claim that simi- les are understood as implicit categorization assertions. ARE NOVEL METAPHORS BETTER AS SIMILES? Bowdle and Gentner (2005) asked people to judge whether novel and conventional metaphoric assertions were preferable in either metaphor or simile form. They found that novel metaphors were preferred in sim- ile form, while conventional ones were pre- ferred in metaphor form. More tellingly, they found that novel metaphoric assertions were understood more quickly in simile than in metaphor form, while the reverse was true for conventional metaphors. These data seem to support the career-of-metaphor argument. As a metaphor becomes more familiar, the more likely will it be treated as a categorization rather than as a compari- son assertion. There may, however, be a seri- ous problem with this conclusion. We know from earlier work that novel metaphors are processed just as quickly as comparable literal expressions, but only if the metaphors are apt, that is, if they are good metaphors (Blasko & Connine, 1993). The metaphors used by Bowdle and Gentner may have var- ied not only in conventionality but also in aptness. One very real possibility is that their novel metaphors, such as A ﬁsherman is (like) a spider, were just not very good metaphors. Comparisons are more constrained attribu- tive assertions than are categorizations, and so for poor or limited metaphors, com- parisons may be preferred to categorical assertions. Conventional metaphors, on the other hand, would tend to be reasonably good ones; otherwise, they would not have become conventional in the ﬁrst place! To address this issue, we developed a pro- cedure to generate apt novel metaphors to see whether they would be preferred and more easily understood in categorical rather than in comparison form (Haught & Glucks- berg, 2004). We selected a set of apt and comprehensible conventional metaphorical assertions, such as My lawyer was (like) a shark and Some ideas are (like) diamonds. We then made them novel by modify- ing the metaphor vehicle (for metaphors) or the simile predicate term (for simi- les), using adjectives that are applicable to the metaphor topic, but not to the literal\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 77 Fish?

A conventional metaphor with no literal referent. metaphor term, as in My lawyer was (like) a well-paid shark or Some ideas are (like) the- oretical diamonds. For such constructions, we expected people to ﬁnd the assertion apt and comprehensible in metaphor form because the metaphorical shark can be well paid, and the metaphorical diamond can be theoreti- cal. However, in simile form, the predicate term refers at the literal, basic level, and so these similes should be neither apt nor com- prehensible (see Figure 4.4). After all, lit- eral sharks can’t plausibly be well paid, and real, literal diamonds can’t plausibly be the- oretical (if they were, then they would be fake diamonds!). These metaphors and sim- iles would provide a counterexample for the career-of-metaphor hypothesis: they would be novel expressions that work in metaphor form, but are difﬁcult to interpret in simile form. We gave adjectivally modiﬁed metaphor- ical assertions along with their original, non- modiﬁed versions to college students in both metaphor and simile forms. One group rated each statement type in terms of how apt the expressions were, that is, how well did they communicate an idea or a character- ization of the statement’s topic. An inde- pendent group rated how comprehensible or easy to understand each statement was. As expected, the novel metaphors were rated as apt as their original conventional counter- parts. However, in simile form, they were rated as much less apt. This ﬁnding sup- ports the dual reference hypothesis, that the metaphor vehicle in similes refers at the lit- eral level, but in metaphors at the superor- dinate metaphorical level. A metaphorical shark can plausibly be well paid, but the lit- eral marine creature is not something that can be characterized in terms of salary or monetary income (except perhaps in ﬁsh markets or on restaurant menus). The com- prehensibility ratings painted a similar pic- ture, as did response times to judge the sen- sibility of each type of statement. People took about the same time to judge that the novel and original metaphors were sensible, but the novel similes took much longer to judge than did the novel metaphors. These data are clear. There is no advantage of sim- iles over metaphors for novel metaphorical assertions, whether in terms of rated aptness, rated comprehensibility, or comprehension time. To the contrary, novel metaphors were privileged over novel similes. But were these metaphors really novel? After all, they were all based on con- ventional, well-known metaphors. Can we ﬁnd truly novel metaphors that are privi- leged in categorical over comparison form? Fortunately, Bowdle and Gentner (2005) provide the perfect source. They gener- ated truly novel metaphors that are privi- leged in comparison over categorical form in two ways. First, when asked to rate these metaphors, there was a marked pref- erence for the comparison over the cate- gorical form. Metaphors such as science is a glacier were preferred in comparison form, as in science is like a glacier, while con- ventional metaphors, such as some jobs are jail, were preferred in categorical form. Sec- ond, their novel metaphors were understood more quickly in comparison than in cate- gorical form, while the reverse was true for conventional metaphors. Were these results due to the novelty of the metaphors that were used, or instead to some other char- acteristic, such as aptness? Jones and Estes (2006) examined this question directly, and found that aptness – that is, how good a metaphor is – accounted for most of the variance in preference for trope form, as well as for differences in comprehen- sion difﬁculty of comparison and categorical forms. But what accounts for relative apt- ness of metaphors, be they conventional or novel?\n78 SAM GLUCKSBERG One answer to this question is suggested by the ability for most metaphors to be para- phrased quite adequately as similes and vice versa. What makes this possible is the dual reference function of metaphor vehicles, as illustrated in Figure 4.1b. In this conven- tional metaphor, the vehicle “shark” is pol- ysemous. In the categorical form, it refers to the abstract metaphorical category that we call “sharks,” which includes any crea- ture that is vicious, predatory, aggressive, and which can characterize any living being from card sharks to used car salespeople to lawyers (alas). In comparison form, it refers to the literal marine creature, shark. The shark– lawyer metaphor is apt in both categorical and comparison form because both types of referents are available – the metaphorical as well as the literal. However, we can imagine metaphors for which only one type of refer- ent is available: either for the literal for the comparison form, or for the metaphorical for the categorical form. Some adjectivally modiﬁed metaphors, such as Many corporate lawyers are well-paid sharks, exemplify the metaphorical referent type. Because well- paid literal sharks do not exist, this metaphor has only the one type of referent, namely, the abstract metaphorical category of predatory, aggressive creatures. Hence, it can only be understood as a categorical assertion, not as a comparison. In this special case, the metaphor vehi- cle does not provide the capacity for dual reference because the literal referent – well- paid sharks – does not exist. Analogously, Bowdle and Gentner’s metaphors also do not provide for dual reference. Here, the relevant abstract categories do not exist, leaving only literal referents available, as in the assertion science is a glacier. This asser- tion is difﬁcult to interpret in categorical form because “glacier” does not call to mind any interpretable abstract metaphorical cat- egory. In contrast, the comparison Science is like a glacier can be interpreted by invit- ing the addressee to consider properties of glaciers that might be applicable to “sci- ence,” perhaps cold and dispassionate, per- haps slow (or as Al Gore might remark, melting down?). How can we render such G eolo g ical F o r m atio n E m pir ical Glacier Slo w , Cold … . (i s a) Empir ical Glacier (i s lik e?) Scie n ce O n ly the metaphor ical g lacier ca n be empir ical. Figure 4.5. A novel metaphor with no literal referent. metaphors more interpretable in categorical than in comparison form? Simply by mod- ifying them so that instead of having no metaphorical referent, they would now have no literal referent, as in science is (like) an empirical glacier. Since literal glaciers cannot be empirical, science cannot be like them, as illustrated in Figure 4.5. Other exam- ples of literal-referent metaphors that can be converted to metaphorical-referent ones include A mind is (like) an idea-ﬁlled kitchen, A newspaper is (like) a daily telescope, A bill- board is (like) an advertising wart, and Moon light is (like) romantic bleach.7 Using Bowdle and Gentner’s items and their modiﬁed versions (as above), we repeated their experiments to see (a) whether we could replicate their results when using their original items and (b) whether we could completely reverse those results when we used our modiﬁed versions of them. In brief, we replicated their ﬁnd- ings with their original items and reversed them with the modiﬁed items. People again demonstrated a preference for compari- son over categorical form for the orig- inal, literal-referent metaphors but now demonstrated a preference for categorical over comparison form for the metaphor- referent metaphors. Indeed, the preference ratings for these latter metaphor types were comparable to the ratings for conventional metaphors. More telling, we found that peo- ple understood literal-referent metaphors more quickly in comparison than categor- ical form but found the reverse for the metaphor-referent metaphors (Glucksberg & Haught, 2006a). Apparently, whether a metaphor is understood more easily in\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 79 categorical versus comparison form does not depend on novelty or conventionality but instead on the referential and seman- tic properties of the metaphor. As Glucks- berg and Haught (2006a) put it, “Different metaphors will have different careers” (p. 928). CAN METAPHORS AND SIMILES HAVE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS? We turn now to a most important character- istic of metaphors and their apparent simile counterparts. We have already seen a case in which novel metaphors are far more apt and comprehensible than their simile coun- terparts. Can we identify a case in which a metaphor and a simile are equally apt and comprehensible but turn out to have quite different interpretations? If so, then any theory of metaphor that relies on the interpretative equivalence of metaphors and similes must be revised to account for this phenomenon. We have already alluded to the possibil- ity that a metaphor and its corresponding simile might have distinctly different inter- pretations. Consider the assertion that my lawyer was/was like an old shark. In the sim- ile form, the predicate old shark refers to the literal marine creature. Old sharks, like old ﬁsh in general, are not particularly attractive. They tend to be past their prime, relatively weak, slow; in short, they have the proper- ties that are stereotypically associated with old age. Accordingly, people should ascribe properties such as ineffectual, weak, and tired not only to the literal old shark but also to the topic of the simile, the lawyer who is likened to an old shark. In contrast, in the metaphor My lawyer was an old shark, the metaphor vehicle refers to the metaphorical shark, not the literal one. Accordingly, peo- ple should ascribe properties such as com- petent, aggressive, and experienced to this shark, as well as to the lawyer who is a mem- ber of the category old sharks. Is this dif- ference simply attributable to comparison versus categorization in general.? Not at all. For literal statements such as My lawyer was (was like) an old pro, there seems to be no dif- ference between the categorical and compar- ison forms. In both cases, My lawyer is con- sidered to be sharp, wise, and experienced. We gave people metaphors and their corresponding similes for which the literal and metaphorical referents of the metaphor vehicle had distinctly different properties, as in these examples, along with typical inter- pretations of them: i. His job was/was like a secure jail. Metaphor: His job was very unpleas- ant and conﬁning, but it was safe, like having tenure. Simile: His job was unpleasant and conﬁning, like a high-security prison. ii. Some ideas are/are like small dia- monds. Metaphor: Some ideas are very valu- able, have a lot of potential, and, if developed, they can become big dia- monds. Simile: Some ideas are somewhat valuable and have some potential, but they are still small and there- fore disappointing compared to big- ger diamonds. For tropes like these, people consistently provided interpretations that sharply dif- fered between their metaphor and simile forms (Glucksberg & Haught, 2006b). The implications for theories of metaphor are as clear as they are important. Because metaphors and their corresponding similes can differ in interpretation, any theory that assumes the equivalence of metaphors and similes cannot be true. This holds for com- parison theories that claim that metaphors are understood by means of a comparison process, as well as categorization theories that claim that similes are invariably under- stood as categorizations. Comparison versus Categorization Reconsidered Since neither a pure comparisons nor a pure class-inclusion theory is tenable, how can we characterize these two processes for comprehending metaphors? The career-of- metaphor hypothesis seemed promising, but\n80 SAM GLUCKSBERG it ultimately failed for at least two rea- sons. First, novel but apt metaphors are not privileged in simile form over metaphor form. Second, and more important, simi- les may not have the same meaning as their corresponding metaphors, and so the theory must be able to account for any changes in meaning as a metaphor becomes more con- ventional. An alternative to the career-of-metaphor hypothesis might be the quality-of- metaphor hypothesis. Really good meta- phors work best as categorizations and some- times work only as categorization assertions (like the well-paid shark example). In such metaphors, the vehicle concept is an ideal exemplar of the category it represents. Poor or limited metaphors might well work best as similes, even when highly conventional. Consider the familiar expression I felt like a sardine in the context of jam-packed, crowded situations. It has a very narrow, indeed unidimensional, predication: to be packed together like sardines in a can. In no other respect is one characterized as a sardine: not ﬁshy, oily, small, or edible. Probably because the attribution of one, context-dependent sardine property is intended, this familiar metaphor doesn’t seem to work as a categorization assertion, that is, I felt I was a sardine doesn’t quite cap- ture the same intention as I felt like a sardine. For most metaphors, the simile and cat- egorization forms yield the same interpre- tations. When they appear in metaphor form, they are understood as class-inclusion assertions. When they appear in simile form, there are two possibilities: they could be understood either as implicit categoriza- tions or as comparisons. When, however, a metaphor and its corresponding simile yield different interpretations, then only the metaphor is understood as a categorization. The simile must be understood as a com- parison. Finally, when a metaphor cannot be readily understood as a categorization, as in the sardine example or as in the science– glacier example, then it may be interpreted as a comparison but only as a narrowly con- strained one. Comparison and categoriza- tion may thus be viewed as complemen- tary strategies for understanding metaphors, with the choice of strategy dependent on the quality and aptness of the metaphor. Com- parisons are resorted to when a categoriza- tion doesn’t make much sense; categoriza- tions are used when a metaphor is apt, even when it is a novel metaphor. Conclusions We began our discussion of metaphor com- prehension by considering three issues: The priority of literal versus ﬁgurative mean- ings, the role of comparison processes in metaphor comprehension, and the relation between a metaphor’s and a simile’s mean- ing. We reached three important conclu- sions. 1. Literal meaning does not have uncon- ditional priority. Metaphor comprehension, like language comprehension in general, is automatic and mandatory. We cannot refuse to understand, and when metaphoric mean- ing is available, it will be processed (Giora, 2003; Glucksberg, 2001; Keysar, 1989). 2. Metaphors are not generally under- stood as comparisons, but comparisons may well be understood as categorizations, whether they are literal or ﬁgurative. Simi- les, in general will be understood as implicit categorizations, but only when their corre- sponding metaphors are apt. 3. Metaphors and similes are not always interchangeable. Because of the dual refer- ence function of metaphor vehicles, these two forms can express different mean- ings, sometimes subtly different, sometimes quite sharply so. Indeed, not only can the two forms yield different interpretations, in some cases an expression may work only in metaphor form (as in the well- paid shark example) and in others only in simile form (as in the sardine exam- ple). This suggests very strongly that both comparison and categorization processes can be employed for understanding metaphors. An issue for future research to resolve is, what are the circumstances that lead to the choice of one over the other strategy for understanding both similes and metaphors?\nHOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY 81 This issue is as yet unresolved, either for literally or ﬁguratively intended comparison assertions. And, to return to our autistic savant Christopher Boone, we can reassure him that metaphors are not lies, and they are not sim- iles either! Notes 1 For metaphors of the form X is a Y, X is the topic of the assertion, and Y the vehicle. In the surgeon–butcher example, the topic surgeon is assigned to the vehicle category butchers and inherits salient properties of that vehicle category, such as grossly incompetent. In the context of surgeon, incompetence is instan- tiated as bloody, causing bodily injury, and so. For the metaphor my butcher is a surgeon, topic and vehicle roles are reversed and now the topic butcher inherits stereotypical prop- erties of the vehicle category surgeons, for example, precise, expert, skillful. 2 Some metaphorically intended utterances or expressions may well pose interpretative problems and hence take longer to under- stand. Indeed, some may be uninterpretable for some people in some circumstances. For a villager in Nepal who is unfamiliar with American corporate greed and practices, an expression such as “There’s going to be many more Enrons down the road” would be com- pletely opaque. Closer to home, non-apt attempts at metaphor, such as “a mind is a kitchen” or “a ﬁsherman is a spider” (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005) are difﬁcult to interpret and may well take a lot of time and distress. Even seasoned journalists can leave their readers hopelessly muddled in their zeal to coin novel expressions, as in this excerpt from an article on Martina Hingis’s negative opinions of con- temporary women’s tennis: “As the cerebral point choreographer with the famous Chucky Doll grin, she used to inspire the glamour lugs on the women’s tour to stretch their minds when they clomped on the court to play her” (Roberts, 2004, p. D1). 3 The interchangeability of similes and meta- phors works most of the time, but as we shall see, this is not a universal property of similes and their corresponding metaphors. 4 The two levels of abstraction involved in metaphor versus simile are reﬂected in the deﬁnition of metaphor in the Oxford English Dictionary (1996): A thing considered as rep- resentative of some other (usually abstract) thing: A symbol. The literal shark is repre- sentative of the metaphorical shark category, and so can be used as a symbol of that cate- gory, as well as a referring expression for it. 5 This last phenomenon has the most critical implication for theories of metaphor compre- hension. If metaphors and their correspond- ing similes can have quite different interpre- tations, then any theory that requires this last phenomenon has the most critical implica- tion for theories of metaphor comprehension. If metaphors and their corresponding similes can have quite different interpretations, then any theory that requires metaphors and sim- iles to “mean” the same thing, such as com- parison theory, cannot be viable. 6 This ﬁnding is analogous to Klein and Mur- phy’s (2001) demonstration that polysemous words – words that have different but related senses, such as wrapping paper and daily paper – do not prime one another. Appar- ently, the literal and metaphorical senses of metaphor vehicles behave much like the sev- eral senses of polysemous words. 7 Lest the reader doubt that such expressions can appear in normal text or conversation, consider this metaphor from the New York Times sports pages: “Coach Herman Edwards had appealed to his players’ vanity leading up to the game. Their pride was the garlic clove that Edwards waved to stave off pes- simism’s bloodthirsty advances” (K. Krouse, October 25, 2005). Like our experimental items, this metaphor has no possible literal referent, and so is distinctly infelicitous in comparison form; that is, Like the garlic clove just doesn’t work here.

According to classical rhetoric and most later theories, including Gricean pragmatics, they are. No, metaphors are wholly normal, say the Romantic critics of classical rhetoric and a variety of modern scholars ranging from hard-nosed cognitive scientists to postmodern critical theorists. On the metaphor-as-normal side, there is a broad contrast between those, like the cog- nitive linguists Lakoff, Talmy, or Faucon- nier, who see metaphor as pervasive in lan- guage because it is constitutive of human thought, and those, like the psycholinguists Glucksberg or Kintsch, or relevance theo- rists, who describe metaphor as emerging in the process of verbal communication.1 While metaphor cannot be both wholly nor- mal and a departure from normal language use, there might be distinct, though related, metaphorical phenomena at the level of thought, on the one hand, and verbal com- munication, on the other. This possibility ∗ We are grateful to Ray Gibbs, Robyn Carston, and Franc¸ois Recanati for valuable discussion and com- ments on an earlier version. is being explored in the work of Raymond Gibbs, for instance.2 In this chapter, we focus on the relevance-theoretic approach to lin- guistic metaphors. Relevance theory’s approach to metaphor is deﬂationary. Most rhetorical, literary, and philosophical traditions emphasize both the importance and the distinctiveness of metaphor. We acknowledge its importance but dispute its distinctiveness. Certainly, metaphors are ubiquitous in language use and contribute to what Barthes called “le plaisir du texte.” Speciﬁc uses of metaphors by individual authors or in given literary gen- res are indeed worthy of study, and so is the very idea of metaphor as a culturally salient notion with a long, rich history. Still, we see metaphors as simply a range of cases at one end of a continuum that includes lit- eral, loose, and hyperbolic interpretations. In our view, metaphorical interpretations are arrived at in exactly the same way as these other interpretations. There is no mecha- nism speciﬁc to metaphor, no interesting generalisation that applies only to them. In other terms, linguistic metaphors are not a natural kind, and “metaphor” is not a 84\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 85 theoretically important notion in the study of verbal communication. Relevance The- ory’s account of metaphor is on the lean side, and is bound to disappoint those who feel that verbal metaphor deserves a full- ﬂedged theory of its own, or should be at the centre of a wider theory of language, or even of thought. The widely accepted view that language use is governed by a norm of literalness (which is violated by metaphor and other ﬁgurative uses – hence their distinctive- ness) follows straightforwardly from the even more widely accepted view that the function of language in communication is to allow the speaker to encode her meaning and the hearer to decode it. Debunking this “code model” view of human communica- tion is a necessary ﬁrst step towards putting metaphor in a proper perspective. The Function of Language in Communication A code is a systematic pairing of messages and signals. Encoding a message into a signal that a recipient can then decode is a very simple way to communicate very simple messages. Nonhuman animals do it all the time. Formally speaking, human languages are also codes: they are systems of sound- sense pairs generated by an underlying gram- mar. But although they are codes, human languages are vastly different from the codes of animal communication. First, and most obvious, they are incomparably richer. Lan- guages not only contain a vast repertoire of expressive elements – the lexicon – with no counterpart in animal signalling systems, but these elements are combined by a syntax with unbounded generative capacities. Human languages differ from animal codes in another respect that should be equally obvious but is hardly ever mentioned: they are grossly defective as codes. If communication is to be achieved purely by coding and decoding, each sig- nal in the code must unambiguously con- vey exactly the same content on all occa- sions. Ambiguity – where the same signal is paired with several messages – will stall the decoding process. True, there are cases even in animal communication where the exact message encoded by a given signal varies with the context. In the “bee dance,” for instance, the orientation of the bees’ com- municative movements indicates the direc- tion in which pollen is to be found, but this indication is relative to the position of the sun at the time. Limited context- sensitivity of this type can be handled by automatic code-like rules of disambiguation and accommodated in a coding-decoding system. However, the interpretation of the linguistic utterances that humans use to communicate is far too context-sensitive to be automatically achieved in purely code- like terms. The sentences of a natural lan- guage are typically multiply ambiguous; they contain referential expressions whose values cannot be assigned by decoding alone; the senses they ambiguously encode are often elliptical or incomplete; and there are still other ways in which the encoded mean- ing of a sentence falls short of determining what it may be used to communicate. So although a language is formally a code, and human communication involves linguis- tic coding and decoding, there is a con- siderable gap between the semantic struc- ture a sentence encodes and the meaning a speaker manages to convey by uttering that sentence in a given situation. In the case of metaphors and other tropes, this gap is often acknowledged as if it were an excep- tion, and described in terms of a distinc- tion between literal and ﬁgurative meaning.3 We claim that metaphors are not excep- tional, and that the linguistic content of all utterances, even those that are literally understood, vastly underdetermines their interpretation. When we say that human languages are defective as codes, we do not mean to imply that there is something wrong with them, or that we should want to improve on them (as some philosophers in the analytic tradi- tion once proposed). On the contrary, we assume that human languages are exquisitely well suited to performing their function in communication. It is just that this function\n86 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON cannot be to encode speakers’ intended meanings. Humans communicate not only by using language but also by producing a variety of what we call “ostensive stimuli”: that is, actions (e.g. gestures or speech) or traces of actions (e.g. writings) that are manifestly intended to attract an addressee’s attention and convey some content. Many of these ostensive stimuli do not belong to a code, and so do not, properly speaking, encode anything. By using ostensive stimuli, humans are capable of communicating without lan- guage and indeed without any other code. How can a stimulus convey a meaning that it doesn’t encode? By providing evidence that the communicator intends to convey this meaning. Suppose that Mary is angry with Peter and doesn’t want to talk to him. When he tries to engage her in conversation, she might (1) stare pointedly at the ceiling (2) open a newspaper and start reading it. These actions do not draw on any established code. Nonetheless, what staring at the ceil- ing or opening a paper suggests to Peter is that Mary would rather do these things than talk to him at that time. Given that these actions are ostensive stimuli (i.e., are per- formed in order to attract his attention and convey some content to him), Peter under- stands Mary to mean that she doesn’t want to talk to him. He interprets her in this way not because of some underlying code that systematically pairs stimuli of this type to a meaning of this type, but because her actions bring this interpretation to mind, and the best possible explanation of Mary’s behaviour is to assume that this is just what it was intended to do. A stimulus can con- vey a meaning it does not encode by provid- ing evidence that the communicator intends to convey this meaning. Here, the mean- ing is recovered not by decoding but by inference. What is true of uncoded communicative stimuli is also true of coded stimuli used in human communication: they too convey their producer’s intended meaning not by directly encoding it but by encoding some evidence of it. In the situation described, Mary might (3) look angrily at Peter and clamp her mouth ﬁrmly shut, (4) look angrily at Peter, put a ﬁnger to her lips, and whisper “Shhh!” In (3) and (4), Mary makes a gesture conven- tionally used to convey a request for silence, from which Peter can infer that she does not want to talk to him. Unlike the actions in (1) and (2), clamping one’s mouth ﬁrmly shut or whispering “Shhh” may be seen as encoding some meaning, but this encoded meaning is much vaguer than Mary’s own meaning. For instance, the same gestures might be used in other situations to convey a request for secrecy. In the present situation, though, they are enough to indicate Mary’s meaning. In the same situation as before, Mary might also (5) say, “I am deaf and dumb,” (6) say, “I won’t talk to you.” Obviously, the decoded linguistic content of Mary’s utterance in (5) does not directly yield her meaning, but it provides a start- ing point for inferring her meaning that is not too different in effect from the gesture of clamping one’s mouth shut, as in (3). In both cases, what is activated in Peter’s mind is the idea of its being impossible to talk, an idea whose import is easy enough to work out in the situation. What about Mary’s utterance in (6)? Surely this, at least, encodes her exact meaning? In fact, it too falls some way short of doing so: the future tense does not indi- cate when Mary won’t talk to Peter; the indicative form does not indicate whether she is expressing a prediction, a warning, or a threat. On another occasion, she might use the same sentence to promise Peter that she will talk to the whole group rather than just to him. Still, in the situation described, Peter can reconstruct Mary’s full mean- ing by starting from the linguistic content\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 87 of her utterance and specifying it further to reach a contextually plausible inter- pretation. What these examples illustrate is the gen- eral point that, whether or not it involves the use of a language or some other code, human communication is inferential communica- tion. The communicator provides some evi- dence of her meaning and the addressee infers this meaning on the basis of this evi- dence and the context. The evidence may or may not be coded, and if it is coded, it may or may not be linguistic, but in each case, it provides input to an inferential pro- cess whose goal is to interpret the communi- cator’s meaning. Which raises the following question: what is the point of using a lan- guage at all if the kind of thing it can be used to achieve can also be achieved with- out it? The point is that a language pro- vides an unbounded repertoire of evidence of the speaker’s meaning, evidence that can be as nuanced, as complex, as richly struc- tured as the speaker likes. Nonverbal kinds of evidence are much more limited. With lan- guage (and only with language) people can communicate about anything they can think about, whether they can point to it or not, imitate it or not, and they can do this with endless reﬁnement. The fact that the inter- pretations of utterances are not encoded but merely evidenced by their linguistic mean- ing does not detract from the richness of lin- guistic communication, but, on the contrary, enhances it: every single sentence may give rise to an open array of interpretations which go well beyond the encoded senses. Some of the best illustrations of this are, of course, creative metaphors. How Relevance Guides Inferential Comprehension What we have sketched so far is a view of ver- bal communication suggested by the work of the philosopher Paul Grice, but more radi- cal than his. Grice characterised a speaker’s meaning as an overt intention to cause a certain cognitive effect in an audience via their recognition of one’s intention to cause this effect (Grice, 1989, chapters 5–6, 14, 18). A speaker’s meaning, so understood, is an intention, a mental state. The mental states of others cannot be simply perceived or decoded, but must be inferred from their behaviour, together with background infor- mation. What is special about a speaker’s meaning as compared with other mental states (which people usually keep to them- selves) is that speakers intend their audience to discover their meaning, and provide evi- dence to that effect, in the form of commu- nicative behaviour. This raises the possibility that there might be an inferential procedure uniquely adapted to comprehension. Grice tended to take for granted – and Searle explicitly argued – that when some- one uses language to communicate, she is presumed to express her meaning literally. It can then be assumed by default that the literal linguistic meaning of the utterance is her meaning, or at least the explicit part of her meaning (Grice’s “what is said”), with only the implicit part (Grice’s “implica- tures”) left to be inferred. This amounts, in practice, to saying that part of the speaker’s meaning is decoded and part is inferred. Metaphors and other tropes, where the lin- guistic meaning of the utterance is not even part of the speaker’s meaning, are excep- tional in this respect: Grice suggested that in metaphor, the speaker is not really say- ing what she appears to be saying, but merely “makes as if to say” it, so that in this case, the speaker’s meaning must be wholly inferred. We claim, by contrast, that verbal comprehension involves no presump- tion of literalness and no default interpre- tation, and that metaphors are in no way exceptional. All human intentional commu- nication works in the way outlined above: the communicator produces a piece of evi- dence of her meaning – the ostensive stim- ulus – and the addressee infers her mean- ing from this piece of evidence and the context. Linguistic utterances are just one type of ostensive stimulus. Verbal com- munication is always context-sensitive and inferential. How exactly does inferential comprehen- sion work? Relevance theory draws on a\n88 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON precise characterisation of relevance and its role in human cognition to put forward a testable account of the comprehension mechanism, an account in which expecta- tions of relevance play a crucial role. We analyse relevance not just as a prop- erty of utterances or other ostensive stimuli, but as a property that any input to a cog- nitive process might possess: sights, sounds, utterances, thoughts, memories, supposi- tions may all be relevant to an individual at a given time. When is an input relevant? When processing it in the context of previ- ously available information yields new cog- nitive effects. The input may answer a ques- tion the individual had in mind, it may raise or settle a doubt, suggest a hypothesis or a course of action, conﬁrm or disconﬁrm a suspicion, correct a mistake. All these cog- nitive effects involve a fruitful interaction between the input and the context in which it is processed. However, the interaction may be more or less fruitful; inputs may be more or less relevant. What makes one input more relevant than another? Suppose you are a caterer making lunch for a group of 10 people, and all you need to know is how many will want the vegetarian menu. Then the information that three of them are vegetarian would be more relevant to you than the information that three of them are Buddhists (from which it follows that they are probably, though not deﬁnitely, vegetarian). In general, it is more informative to learn that someone is a Buddhist than to learn that he is a vege- tarian, but if the context is such that only his food preferences are consequential, then the less informative input is more relevant. The greater the cognitive effects produced by processing an input, the greater its rel- evance (to the person processing it, at the time). However, cognitive effects are only one of two factors that affect the relevance of an input. The other is the processing effort involved in achieving these effects. Some effort of perception, memory or infer- ence is required to represent the input, access contextual information, and derive cognitive effects. In the situation described above, suppose that the choice is between a straightforward statement that three of the guests are vegetarian and a brochure with a short biography of all 10 guests, mention- ing inter alia whether they are vegetarian. In this case, the brochure would be less rel- evant than the straightforward statement: although both would contain all the infor- mation required, extracting this informa- tion from the brochure would involve more effort for the same effect, hence less rele- vance. In a nutshell: Degrees of relevance: (a) The greater the cognitive effects achieved by processing an input, the greater its relevance. (b) The smaller the processing effort required to achieve these effects, the greater the relevance. At every moment in their waking lives, humans have a huge variety of inputs com- peting for their attention: things and events they perceive, previous thoughts that have not been fully digested, pending goals, and so on. For contexts to use in processing these inputs, they have a vast mental encyclopae- dia of accumulated knowledge on which to draw. At any given moment, most of these inputs are not worth processing, and, for any given input, most of this background infor- mation is not worth activating: the result- ing process would yield too few cognitive effects to be worth the effort. Cognitive efﬁ- ciency is very much a matter of selecting the most relevant inputs available at each point, and processing them in the context of back- ground information that will most enhance their relevance. In fact, if there were not a strong tendency to select maximally relevant inputs, cognition would be an extremely wasteful activity. We assume that, among the many selective pressures that have driven the evolution of human cognitive capac- ities, there has been a constant pressure on the cognitive system as a whole, on its component parts, and on their articulation, towards an efﬁcient use of brain resources. We therefore put forward the following claim:\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 89 Cognitive Principle of Relevance: Human cognition tends to be geared to the maximisation of relevance. We are not claiming that humans always succeed in maximising relevance, but only that they have a sufﬁcient tendency to do so to make their massive investment in cogni- tion evolutionarily worthwhile. More specif- ically, we are claiming that human percep- tual mechanisms tend to pick out potentially relevant stimuli, human retrieval mecha- nisms tend to activate potentially relevant background assumptions, and human infer- ential mechanisms tend to process them in the most productive way, so that, overall, attention tends to go to the inputs with the greatest expected relevance. These claims have a variety of experimentally testable consequences (see van der Henst & Sperber, 2004). Here we are only concerned with the consequences of the cognitive principle of relevance for human communication. Given the indeﬁnite variety of possible objects of attention and courses of thought, it would be impossible for one person to pre- dict what others will attend to, and what thoughts it will prompt, if their attention and thought processes were not guided by considerations of relevance. The tendency to maximise relevance is crucial to mak- ing human mental processes relatively inter- pretable and predictable. As a result of the same tendency, it is possible not only to inter- pret and predict, but also to manipulate the mental processes of others, by producing a stimulus which will predictably attract their attention and be interpreted in foreseeable ways. Jill knows it is relevant to Peter that all his guests should be happy, so she leaves her empty glass in his line of sight, anticipating that he will pay attention and conclude that she would like another drink. This is not yet a case of inferential communication, because, although Jill intends Peter to come to this conclusion, she provides evidence only that she is thirsty, and not that she intends to inform Peter that she is thirsty. If instead she had established eye contact with him and waved her empty glass, or said to him, “My glass is empty,” then the stimulus would be ostensive, and her behaviour would be prop- erly communicative. Use of an ostensive stimulus as opposed to a regular non-ostensive one provides the addressee with information not only about some state of affairs (e.g., the fact that Jill would like another drink) but also about the communicator’s intention to convey this information, and to do so overtly. By pro- ducing an ostensive stimulus, the communi- cator openly requests the addressee’s atten- tion. Since attention tends to go to the most relevant inputs available, the communicator implicitly conveys that her message is such an input. The central claim of relevance- theoretic pragmatics is that use of an osten- sive stimulus raises expectations of relevance not raised by other inputs, and that these expectations guide the comprehension pro- cess. More speciﬁcally, we claim: Communicative Principle of Relevance: Every act of inferential communication con- veys a presumption of its own optimal rele- vance. The presumption of optimal relevance mentioned in the communicative principle has a precise content. The utterance (or other communicative act) is presumed to be relevant enough to be worth process- ing, from which it follows that it must be more relevant than other inputs competing for the addressee’s attention at the time. In some conditions, it can be presumed to be even more relevant than that. Communica- tor and addressee have at least one common goal: that communication should succeed – that is, that the addressee should understand what the communicator meant. The more relevant the utterance, and in particular the less processing effort it requires, the more likely it is that the addressee will under- stand it successfully. The communicator can therefore be expected, within the limits of her expressive abilities, and without going against her own goals (and in particular the goal she is pursuing in communicating), to have aimed at maximal relevance. So when we say that every act of inferential commu- nication conveys a presumption of its own\n90 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON optimal relevance, we mean something quite precise: as much relevance as is compatible with the communicator’s abilities and pref- erences, and, in any case, enough relevance to be worth processing. The communicative principle of rele- vance suggests both a path for the addressee to follow in constructing the interpretation of an utterance, and a stopping point. Since effort is one of the two factors affecting rel- evance, the appropriate path to follow is one of least effort. The stopping point is the point at which the current interpretation (what the speaker is taken to have conveyed, either explicitly or implicitly) satisﬁes the expectations of relevance raised by the utter- ance itself. From the speaker’s point of view, the easiest way to increase the relevance of her communication, and hence the chances of being properly understood, is to express herself (within the limits of her abilities and preferences) so that the interpretation she intends to convey is the ﬁrst interpretation the addressee will come across on the path of least effort that meets the expectations of relevance she herself has raised. To illustrate, consider the following exchange: (7) Peter : For Billy’s birthday party, it would be nice to have some kind of show. Mary : Archie is a magician. Let’s ask him. Suppose that “magician” is ambiguous for Peter, with two senses: (a) someone with supernatural powers who performs magic, and (b) someone who does magic tricks to amuse an audience. In the context of a dis- cussion about a show for a child’s birth- day party, the second sense is likely to be activated ﬁrst, and the information (or the reminder) that their friend Archie is a magi- cian in this sense is likely to satisfy Peter’s expectations of relevance by implying that he might perform at Billy’s birthday party. In presuming that her utterance would be relevant to Peter, Mary must have expected him to derive this implication, which can therefore be seen as an implicit part of her meaning, that is, an implicature. The dis- ambiguation of “magician” as someone who does magic tricks dovetails with this impli- cature, and the two conﬁrm one another by jointly yielding an interpretation that is rel- evant in the expected way. The linguistic meaning of the sentence “Let’s ask him” is very schematic and gappy, leaving the second part of Mary’s utterance wide open to an indeﬁnite range of inter- pretations. “Him” may refer to Archie, or Billy, or someone else. “Ask” may be under- stood as asking for advice, help, an opinion, a favour, and so on. Thus, the whole sen- tence might be used to mean Let’s ask Billy whether he would like to have Archie perform magic tricks at his birthday party. This inter- pretation would make sense in the situation, and would be quite compatible with Grice’s maxims of conversation, or with standard theories of discourse coherence. Still, in a context where the ﬁrst part of the utter- ance (“Archie is a magician”) implicates that Archie could perform magic tricks at Billy’s party, the ﬁrst interpretation found by fol- lowing a path of least effort will be that Peter and Mary should ask Archie to per- form. Since this would satisfy Peter’s expec- tations of relevance, he should accept it as the intended interpretation, without look- ing any further for alternative interpreta- tions that might also be relevant. (None of these other potential interpretations could be optimally relevant, because extra pro- cessing effort would be required to retrieve them. They are therefore not worth consid- ering unless there is some reason to think that Mary has failed to express herself in an optimally relevant way.) In this example, Mary is speaking literally (which shows how far even the interpreta- tion of an utterance that is literally under- stood can go beyond its linguistic meaning and is not just a simple matter of decod- ing). Our claim is that the very same pro- cedure that yields a literal interpretation in this case would yield a nonliteral interpreta- tion in others. Meaning Construction The decoded senses of a word or other lin- guistic expression in an utterance provide a\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 91 point of departure for an inferential process of meaning construction. The meaning con- structed may be narrower than the decoded meaning, as in (8) or (9): (8) I have a temperature. (9) Peter: Does G´erard like eating? Mary: He’s French! In (8), “temperature” would be understood as meaning a temperature above normal.4 What the speaker is communicating would be false if her temperature were a regular 37◦C/98.6◦F. In (9), what Mary means is not just that G´erard is a French national but that he is what she regards as a prototypi- cal Frenchman, and therefore someone who likes eating. On other occasions, the meaning con- structed may be broader than the decoded meaning, as in (10)–(14): (10) Holland is ﬂat. (11) The stones form a circle. (12) (On a picnic, pointing to a ﬂattish rock): That’s a table! (13) (Handing someone a tissue): Here’s a Kleenex. (14) (Handing someone a paper napkin): Here’s a Kleenex. The uses of “ﬂat” in (10) and “circle” in (11) are cases of approximation. Approxi- mation is a variety of loose use or broaden- ing in which a word with a relatively strict sense is extended to a penumbra of items (what Lasersohn, 1999, calls a “pragmatic halo”) that strictly speaking fall outside its linguistically speciﬁed denotation. The uses of “table” in (12) and “Kleenex” in (13) and (14) are cases of category extension. Cate- gory extension, another variety of loose use or broadening, involves extending a word with a relatively precise sense to a range of items that clearly fall outside its linguis- tically speciﬁed denotation, but that share some contextually relevant properties with items inside the denotation. Thus, the ﬂat rock referred to in (12) is deﬁnitely not a table, but has properties which make it a good substitute for a table on that occasion. The tissue referred to in (13) is not a Kleenex, but will do just as well. The paper napkin referred to in (14) is not even a tissue, but is the closest available thing to a tissue, and will do almost as well. With narrowing, literalness is in some sense preserved: a high temperature is lit- erally a temperature, and a Frenchman who likes eating is literally a Frenchman. With broadening, literalness is not preserved: Hol- land is not literally ﬂat, the stones do not literally form a circle, the ﬂattish rock is not literally a table, and neither the tissue nor the paper napkin is literally a Kleenex. However, narrowing and broadening are not two func- tionally distinct types of language use. They both involve the same process of meaning construction, which happens in some cases to lead to a narrowing of the encoded con- cept and in other cases to a broadening. How are these narrowed or broadened lexical meanings arrived at? By following the relevance-guided comprehension procedure outlined above. With (8) (“I have a temper- ature”), a literal interpretation based on the decoded meaning of “temperature” would be an irrelevant truism, since anyone (or indeed anything) has a temperature, just as it has a mass or a location. In fact, there is no reason to think that the hearer constructs and enter- tains such a truism. Rather, what happens is that the concept TEMPERATURE is activated in the hearer’s mind and points him towards a relevant interpretation. This concept has a parameter that can take a range of values, some of which would be relevant in the cir- cumstances (by implying, for instance, that the speaker is ill and unable to work). In the process of arriving at a relevant overall inter- pretation of the utterance, the decoded con- cept TEMPERATURE provides a starting point for constructing a narrowed ad hoc con- cept TEMPERATURE* which ranges only over contextually relevant temperatures: that is, temperatures which depart from the human norm in a way that is easily brought to mind, with implications that are worth the hearer’s processing effort. Similarly, activation of the lexicalised concept FLAT in (10) (“Holland is ﬂat”) gives access to a range of implications that would follow from Holland’s being strictly ﬂat: that it is a good place for easy cycling or not a\n92 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON good place for mountaineering, for instance. These implications hold (to different degrees for different implications) even if Holland is only approximately ﬂat. In a context where (10) is relevant, some of these impli- cations will be immediately obvious to the hearer and will fulﬁl his expectations of rel- evance. The resulting overall interpretation (including the presumption of relevance and the implications that make the utterance rel- evant) will be internally consistent on the assumption that “ﬂat” in (10) indicates the speaker’s intention to convey that Holland is FLAT*, where the ad hoc concept FLAT* rep- resents an approximation to ﬂatness which is close enough to yield the implications that make the whole utterance contextu- ally relevant (for a detailed discussion of this and related examples, see Wilson & Sperber, 2002). In these two examples, the words “tem- perature” or “ﬂat” are used in an utterance to evoke (or, more technically, to activate to some degree) potential implications of the encoded concepts TEMPERATURE or FLAT. More generally, we claim that ideas evoked in comprehension stand in inferential rela- tionships to the concepts that evoke them,5 and are not mere associations based on past co-occurrence, with no inferential status. That is, the ideas evoked by the presence of a word in an utterance are likely to be true of items in the linguistically speciﬁed denota- tion of the word, or, equivalently, of items in the extension of the concept encoded by the word. In the case of narrowing, the impli- cations hold across only part of the exten- sion of the encoded concept (e.g., only some temperatures imply illness). In the case of broadening, the implications hold not only of items in the extension of the encoded con- cept but also of contextually salient items which fall outside the extension, but which share with items inside the extension proper- ties that determine these implications (e.g., cycling is easy not only in ﬂat but also in ﬂat- tish terrains). Some of the implications evoked by the presence of a word are simultaneously evoked by the context. In (13) and (14) (“Here’s a Kleenex,” said of a tissue or a paper napkin), the implication It can be used to blow one’s nose is activated in the hearer’s mind not only by the word “Kleenex” but also by the fact that he has just been sneez- ing. Implications activated by both the utter- ance and the context are the ﬁrst to come to mind, and are tentatively added to the interpretation until the hearer’s expecta- tions of relevance are satisﬁed. At that point, the explicit content of the utterance (in the case of an assertion, the propositions whose truth the speaker is committing her- self to) is retroactively determined by mutu- ally adjusting the implicit and explicit com- ponents of the interpretation. The explicit content of an utterance must be such that it contextually implies the implicit con- tent. More technically, and in relevance- theoretic terms, the explicatures of an utter- ance must be such that, together with the implicit premises of the utterance, they war- rant the derivation of its implicit conclusions (where both implicit premises and implicit conclusions are kinds of implicature). (On the mutual adjustment process, see Carston, 2002; Sperber & Wilson, 1998, 2005; Wilson & Sperber, 2002, 2004.) In the case of (8) (“I have a temperature”), the result of the mutual adjustment process is a contextual construal of “temperature” as TEMPERATURE*, which is narrower than the lexicalised concept TEMPERATURE. In the case of (10) (“Holland is ﬂat”), the result is a contextual construal of “ﬂat” as FLAT*, which is broader than the lexicalised concept FLAT. Narrowings and broadenings of mean- ing are thus arrived at by exactly the same procedure of online concept construction and for the same reasons. In fact, as noted by Carston (1997), they may be combined in a single construal. Suppose that Mary in (9) says of G´erard, “He’s French!” intend- ing to implicate that he likes eating, when, in fact, she knows that G´erard happens to be a citizen of Monaco. She would then be using neither the concept FRENCH, which denotes French nationals and is encoded (let us assume) by the word “French,” nor an appropriate narrowing, FRENCH*, but a concept FRENCH** which is narrower in some respects and broader in others,\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 93 denoting people who ﬁt some prototype of a French person without French national- ity being either a sufﬁcient condition or an absolutely necessary one for inclusion in its extension. Strictly literal interpretations – those that involve neither narrowing nor broadening of the lexicalised concept – are arrived at by exactly the same process of mutually adjust- ing explicit content with implicit content. A literal interpretation results when the impli- cations that make the utterance relevant in the expected way depend on the presence in the explicit content of the lexicalised con- cept itself (rather than some broadening or narrowing of it).6 Literal interpretations are not default interpretations: they are not the ﬁrst to be considered, and they are not neces- sarily easier to construct than nonliteral ones. In fact, some literal interpretations are fairly hard to get, as in (15): (15) If Holland were ﬂat, water would ﬂow from the borders towards the centre. In describing a stretch of land as “ﬂat,” we broaden the concept by ignoring not only the various types of unevenness present in any terrain, but also the curvature of the earth.7 This second departure from the literal mean- ing of “ﬂat” is not so easily corrected. There is a continuum of cases between approximations such as (10) and (11) and hyperboles. In fact, the same utterance can be properly understood hyperbolically, loosely, or literally, depending on the facts of the matter, with no sharp dividing line between the different interpretations. Con- sider (16): (16) Mary to Peter: The soup is boiling. If Peter is too far away to observe the state of the soup directly, how is he to select one of these possible interpretations? On the basis of considerations of relevance, suppose he is upstairs working; when he smells the soup that Mary is making and he says he is com- ing down to taste it, Mary answers as in (16). Then her utterance would be relevant as a warning not to bother: “boiling” would func- tion as a hyperbole, conveying too hot to taste. Or suppose that Peter is making the soup but has left the room, and Mary knows that the soup should not be allowed to boil at this stage. Then her utterance would be relevant enough if the soup were almost boiling: a loose, approximate use rather than a hyper- bole. Suppose, ﬁnally, that Peter is making the soup but has left the room, and Mary knows that he wanted to skim it once it was properly boiling. Then in order to be rele- vant enough, her utterance would have to be interpreted literally. The Literal–Loose–Metaphorical Continuum There is a continuum of cases between lim- ited category extensions such as (12)–(14) and more creative ones such as (17) and (18): (17) ˇZiˇzek is another Derrida. (18) For luggage, pink is the new black (New York Times, September 4, 2005). In (17), “Derrida” is used as a common noun to denote a category of ﬂamboy- ant and obscure philosophers `a la Derrida. In (18), “black” is used to denote a cate- gory of fashionable colours. In both cases, a category is extended to include items that share with its members some prop- erties which may or may not be essen- tial, but are at least salient. These exam- ples of category extension, unlike the use of “Kleenex” to refer to any tissue, are not analysable as mere loose uses. The claim in (17) is not that the differences between ˇZiˇzek and Derrida are inconsequential, but that ˇZiˇzek belongs to a broader category of which Derrida is the most salient mem- ber. The claim in (18) is not that pink is pretty much the same as black, but that it occupies, in the category of colours for luggage, the place previously occupied by black. Still, (17) and (18) are interpreted by the usual process: the presence of the words “Derrida” or “black” helps to activate impli- cations about ˇZiˇzek, on the one hand, and the colour pink, on the other, that make the utterance relevant in the expected way. By mutually adjusting explicit con- tent and implicatures, the explicit content is\n94 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON construed as containing an ad hoc concept (DERRIDA* or BLACK*) that contextually carries these implications. There is a continuum of cases between hyperbole and metaphor. It might seem at ﬁrst blush that hyperbole involves only a quantitative difference between the concept encoded and the concept contextually con- structed, as in (19) below, while metaphor also involves a qualitative difference, as in (20):8 (19) Joan is the kindest person on earth. (20) Joan is an angel. However, the quantitative/qualitative dis- tinction is not sharp. For instance, (21) and (22) would generally be classiﬁed as hyper- boles rather than metaphors, although there is both a quantitative and a qualitative dif- ference between something that is credible and something that is not, or between a saint and an ordinary kind person: (21) Joan is incredibly kind. (22) Joan is a saint. In any case, whether they are classiﬁed as hyperboles or metaphors, (21) and (22) would be interpreted in the same way: the encoded concept helps to activate contex- tual implications that make the utterance relevant as expected, and the concept con- veyed by the hyperbole/metaphor is one of an outstanding type of kindness charac- terised by these implications. There is also a continuum of cases between category extension and metaphor. It might be argued that category extension involves the projection of deﬁning, or at least characteristic, properties of the encoded concept onto a broader category, as in (12)– (14) and (17) and (18), whereas the type of broadening involved in metaphor is based on relatively peripheral or, at least, contingent properties, as in (23) or (24): (23) “Man is but a reed, the weakest in nature.” (Blaise Pascal) (24) My mind is cloudy. Weakness is not a deﬁning property of reeds (and it is only a property relative to some arbitrary comparison class); similarly, the difﬁculty of discerning parts is not a deﬁn- ing property of clouds. However, some metaphors are based on fairly central properties of the lexicalised category. For instance, when the term for an animal body part is extended to a human body part, as in (25), the result would gen- erally be classiﬁed as a metaphor: (25) Henry was proud of his mane. A category may undergo successive broaden- ings, with more peripheral extensions nec- essarily losing some of the most central features of the lexicalised category. Thus, compare (17) (“ ˇZiˇzek is another Derrida”) with (26) and (27): (26) Rebecca Horn is the Derrida of con- temporary art. (27) “Ferran Adria is more Derrida than Danko.” (attested: http://www.egullet. org/tdg.cgi?pg = ARTICLE-tabledan- cingadria – Adria is the world famous chef of El Bulli, Danko is a famous San Francisco chef) In each case, a different concept (DER- RIDA*, DERRIDA**, DERRIDA***) is con- structed, each marginally further away from the original concept (if we accept that there are concepts of individuals) or representa- tion of Jacques Derrida. Central and peripheral properties may combine, as in (28), a comment on a clip of George W. Bush allegedly wiping his glasses on an unsuspecting woman’s shirt during an appearance on Jay Leno’s TV show: (28) We’re all human Kleenex to him (attested: http://www.iﬂipﬂop.com/ 2004/10/metaphor-george-bush-uses- woman-as.html). Here, the woman is implicitly described as a Kleenex, since she (or at least her clothes) can be used as one, and this carries the sug- gestion that Bush sees people as disposable artefacts with little value. Most hyperboles involve only broaden- ing of the encoded concept, with no nar- rowing. In (19), for instance, “the kindest\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 95 Table 5.1: Inferential steps in a literal interpretation (a) Mary has said to Peter “Archie is a magician.” Decoding of Mary’s utterance.

By contrast, most metaphors involve both narrowing and broadening, and so cannot be seen simply as cases of cat- egory extension. In the metaphorical (20), “angel” is interpreted as ANGEL*, which is narrowed, on the one hand, to cover only prototypical kind, caring angels (excluding avenging angels, angels of wrath, or fallen angels) and broadened, on the other, to cover all very kind, caring people. However, this combination of narrowing and broadening is not a deﬁning feature of metaphor. In the metaphorical (28), for instance, “Kleenex” is broadened to something like the category of DISPOSABLE ITEMS, and this includes not only prototypical Kleenex but all Kleenex. Inferential Steps We see this continuity of cases, and the absence of any criterion for distinguishing literal, loose, and metaphorical utterances, as evidence not just that there is some degree of fuzziness or overlap among distinct cat- egories, but that there are no genuinely distinct categories, at least from a descrip- tive, psycholinguistic, or pragmatic point of view.9 Even more important than the lack of clear boundaries is the fact that the same inferential procedure is used in interpreting all these different types of utterance. Let us look in more detail at how this procedure applies to the interpretation of two exam- ples, one at the literal end of the continuum, and the other at the metaphorical end. At the literal end, we return to example (7): (7) Peter: For Billy’s birthday party, it would be nice to have some kind of show. Mary: Archie is a magician. Let’s ask him. Table 5.1 shows the inferential steps that Peter goes through in interpreting the ﬁrst part of Mary’s utterance (“Archie is a\n96 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON Table 5.2: Inferential steps in a metaphorical interpretation (a) Mary has said to Peter “My chiropractor is a magician.” Decoding of Mary’s utterance.

At the metaphorical end of the contin- uum, consider (29): (29) Peter: I’ve had this bad back for a while now, but nobody has been able to help. Mary: My chiropractor is a magician. You should go and see her. Table 5.2 shows, again in simpliﬁed form, the inferential steps that Peter goes through in interpreting the ﬁrst part of Mary’s utterance (“My chiropractor is a magician”). In both cases, of course, interpreta- tion is carried out “on line,” and starts while the utterance is still in progress. We assume, then, that interpretive hypothe- ses about explicit content and implicatures are developed partly in parallel rather than in sequence, and stabilise when they are mutually adjusted so as to jointly conﬁrm the hearer’s expectations of relevance. And we are not, of course, suggesting that the hearer consciously goes through just the steps shown in the tables, with exactly those premises and conclusions. We are not making claims about exact sequences, con- sciousness, or the representational format of thought. We are making claims about fac- tors which cause hearers to converge on an interpretation that – in the case where com- munication is successful – coincides with the one intended by the speaker. Although “magician” is interpreted liter- ally in (7) and metaphorically in (29), the same kind of process is involved in both cases. With (7), the fact that one of the\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 97 lexicalised senses of “magician” is MAGICIAN2, someone who performs magic tricks to amuse an audience, makes it particularly easy to access implications associated to this interpretation. Since these implications end up satisfying the hearer’s expectations of relevance and are carried only by this precise meaning, one of the lexicalised senses of “magician” is selected by the comprehension process as the contextually indicated meaning. With (29), “magician” provides easy access to the information that if someone is a magician, they have extraordinary capacities, and this is enough to ground an optimally relevant overall interpretation. The concept used in this interpretation is substantially broader than MAGICIAN1, so in this case, as a rhetorician would say, “magician” is a metaphor. However, the hearer pays no more attention to the fact that “magician” is used metaphorically in (29) than he does to the fact that it is used literally in (7). For that matter, some people may have only a single encoded sense for “magician”: someone with supernatural powers who per- forms magic. They would still have no dif- ﬁculty arriving at an appropriate interpreta- tion of (7) by extending the category of “real” magicians to include make-believe ones. For other people, the metaphorical sense may have become lexicalised, so that “magician” now has the additional encoded sense some- one who achieves extraordinary things. They would obviously have no trouble arriving at an appropriate interpretation of (29). Mary did not intend her utterance to be under- stood literally in (7) and metaphorically in (29); her communicative intentions – like those of all speakers – are about content and propositional attitude, not rhetorical classi- ﬁcation. Relevance theory’s resolutely inferen- tial approach to comprehension suggests a solution to the “emergent property” issue raised in recent work on metaphor.10 Consider (30): (30) This surgeon is a butcher. Clearly, what this utterance evokes is the idea that the surgeon in question is grossly incompetent, dangerous, and so on. The problem, at least for theories of metaphor based on associations or “connotations”, is that being incompetent, dangerous, and so on are not properties particularly associated with either butchers or surgeons, so how do these properties emerge when the two cate- gories are associated as in (30)? If we treat the relationship between an utterance and its interpretation as inferen- tial, then the issue is whether the proper- ties that seem to “emerge” in the metaphor- ical interpretation can in fact be inferred. It should be obvious that the answer is “yes.” Surgeons and butchers both characteristi- cally cut ﬂesh, but in quite different ways. Surgeons cut live ﬂesh; they cut as little as possible, and with the utmost care to avoid unnecessarily severing blood vessels, nerves, or tendons, thus causing irreparable damage. Butchers cut dead ﬂesh to produce pieces of meat for cooking; this places no prin- cipled restriction on how much should be cut (or minced, broken, pounded, etc.) and puts a premium on severing nerves, tendons, and other hard tissues. So a surgeon who treats ﬂesh as a butcher does would indeed be grossly incompetent and dangerous. The inferential path to an adequate understand- ing of (30) involves an evocation of the way butchers treat ﬂesh and the construction on that basis of an ad hoc concept BUTCHER*, denoting people who treat ﬂesh in the way butchers do. Practically all butchers and (one hopes) very few surgeons fall within the extension of this concept. For a butcher, being a BUTCHER* is a quasi-pleonastic prop- erty. For a surgeon, on the other hand, it does imply gross incompetence – such an incon- ceivable degree of incompetence, in fact, that (30) must be seen not just as a metaphor but also as a hyperbole. A meat lover who cares about precise, careful cuts might praise a butcher by saying: (31) This butcher is a surgeon. The interpretation of (31) is symmetrical with the one sketched above for (30), and involves the construction of an ad hoc con- cept SURGEON*, denoting people who cut\n98 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON ﬂesh with extreme care. A butcher who is also a SURGEON* is outstandingly competent and trustworthy. The predicates BUTCHER* and SURGEON*, along with the implication of incompetence for a surgeon who is a BUTCHER* and of competence for a butcher who is a SURGEON*, emerge unproblemat- ically in the course of an inferential com- prehension process guided by the search for relevance. Of course, examples (30) and (31) involve emergent properties that are particularly easy to analyse in inferential terms, and it remains to be seen how far the full range of cases can be dealt with along these lines. However, this account seems promising, and helps to bring out the contrast between infer- ential approaches to metaphor and more tra- ditional associationist approaches. All infer- ential relationships are associations, but not all associations are inferential. In claiming that interpretation depends only on infer- ential relationships, we might have seemed to be depriving ourselves of some explana- tory power. As this example suggests, just the opposite is true.11 Strength of Contextual Implications, Strength of Implicatures We maintain that metaphors are not a dis- tinct category of language use, let alone a discrete one. Are we then denying the obvi- ous truth that metaphors often stand out as particularly creative and powerful uses of language? If not – and indeed we are not – how are these uses of language to be explained? Utterances achieve relevance by produc- ing cognitive effects. An utterance may have many cognitive effects or only a few, and these effects may be stronger or weaker. To illustrate, suppose you get to the airport in time for a ﬂight due to arrive in Atlanta at 2 p.m. Hearing an announcement that the ﬂight may be delayed, you say to an airline employee: (32) I have to be in Atlanta no later than 5 p.m. Will I make it? She replies as in either (33) or (34): (33) Well, your ﬂight will be delayed by at least 20 minutes. (34) Well, your ﬂight will be delayed by at least 2 hours. Both (33) and (34) imply (35), but only (34) implies (36): (35) You have at least 20 minutes to do as you please before boarding. (36) You have at least 2 hours to do as you please before boarding. (35) in turn implies (37), while (36) implies both (37) and (38): (37) You have time for a drink before board- ing. (38) You have time for a meal before board- ing. Clearly, (34) has more contextual implica- tions than (33). Both (33) and (34) also provide some evidence for the conclusion in (39): (39) You will get to Atlanta later than 5 p.m. Another way of putting this is to say that (33) and (34) weakly imply (39). Such weak implications (or probabiliﬁcations) are also cognitive effects, and contribute to the rele- vance of a cognitive input.12 Since the prob- ability of your arriving late is increased more by (34) than by (33), (39) is a stronger implication (and hence a stronger cognitive effect) of (34) than of (33). Still, if you were to assume on the basis of either utter- ance that you will indeed get to Atlanta later than 5 p.m., this assumption would depend to a considerable extent on your own back- ground beliefs (even more so in the case of (33) than (34)), although it would of course have been encouraged by what the airline employee told you. Overall, this example shows how the contextual implications of an utterance may vary in both quantity and strength. A competent speaker must have good rea- son to suppose that what she says will be rel- evant to the hearer. The hearer himself may have given her such a reason, in particular by asking her a question, thereby letting her\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 99 know that an answer would be relevant to him. Thus, if a stranger comes up to you in the street and asks what time it is, you can feel conﬁdent that it would be relevant to tell him the time, even if you neither know nor care exactly how it would be relevant and are implicating nothing more the presump- tion of relevance that any utterance conveys about itself.13 In most conversations or discourses, the speaker cannot have good reason to think that her utterances will be relevant enough unless she has some positive idea of the cog- nitive effects they will achieve. From the hearer’s perspective, it is quite often safe to assume that the speaker both expected and intended him to derive some of the implications that he does derive, for other- wise she could not reasonably have supposed that her utterance would be optimally rel- evant to him. These intended implications are implicatures of the utterance. An impli- cature may be more or less strongly impli- cated. The speaker may have in mind a spe- ciﬁc implication on which the relevance of her utterance depends, and a strong inten- tion that the hearer should derive it; in that case, it is strongly implicated. At the other extreme, she may have in mind a vague range of possible implications with roughly simi- lar import, any subset of which would con- tribute to the relevance of her utterance, and a weak intention, for any of the implications in that range, that the hearer should derive it; these are weak implicatures. Her intentions about the implicatures of her utterance may fall anywhere between these two extremes. The strength of an implicature is determined by the manifest strength of the speaker’s intention that a speciﬁc implication should be derived. It is important to distinguish the strength of an implicature from the strength of a contextual implication (whether or not it is also implicated), which is the probabil- ity that it is true, given that the premise from which it is contextually derived is true. When the airline employee replies to your question in (32) (about whether you will get to Atlanta by 5 p.m.) as in (33) or (34), she must feel conﬁdent that, in telling you how long the delay is likely to be, she is giving you grounds for deriving a weak implica- tion about the risk of your arriving late, thus indirectly answering your question. In other words, you can take her to be implicating that you might indeed be late, leaving it up to you to decide on the seriousness of the risk. The implication is weak – even weaker with (33) than with (34) – but it is fairly strongly implicated. Does the airline employee also impli- cate (35) or (36) (that you have at least 20 minutes / 2 hours to do as you please before boarding)? Although these implica- tions go beyond simply providing an answer to your question, they may help to make the utterance optimally relevant to you in a way the speaker might have both fore- seen and intended. When a plane is delayed, people generally want to ﬁgure out how much time they will have at their disposal before boarding. To that extent, the air- line employee may be seen as implicating (35) or (36). These are strong implications of her utterance – they are very probably true – but they are only weakly implicated, because they add only marginally to the relevance of the utterance, and so the speaker’s inten- tion to convey them is not strongly manifest. After all, she may have felt that her utterance was relevant enough without even consider- ing these further implications. What about (37) (that you have time for a drink), or (38) (that you have time for a meal)? Does the airline employee also impli- cate these by replying as in (33) or (34)? Again, they are strong implications, which might contribute to the relevance of her utterance in a way the speaker could possi- bly have foreseen, but they are even weaker implicatures, since they are among a range of implications with similar import (that you have enough time to buy a magazine, or buy and read one, that you have enough time to do your e-mail, and so on), some of which are likely to be relevant to you although the speaker is not in a position to know which. So she may be encouraging you to consider any of these implications that might be rele- vant to you, but not any speciﬁc one. These are very weak implicatures, if they are impli- cated at all. By contrast, if your question had\n100 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON been “Do I have time for a drink?” the reply in (33) would strongly implicate (37), and the reply in (34) would strongly implicate (37) and weakly implicate (38), whereas both replies would only weakly implicate (39) (that you will get to Atlanta later than 5 p.m.), if they implicated it at all. Poetic Effects Optimal relevance may be achieved by an utterance with a few strong implications, many weak implications, or any combina- tion of weak and strong implications. A speaker aiming at relevance may implicate (that is, anticipate and intend) a few strong implicatures or a wide range of weak impli- catures (which may themselves be strong or weak implications). There are many ways of achieving relevance, which differ in both the strength of the implications con- veyed and the strength with which they are implicated.14 Here we are particularly concerned with the case where relevance is achieved through a wide array of weak implications which are themselves weakly implicated. The speaker – or writer, since this method of achieving relevance is partic- ularly well developed in literature – has good reason to suppose that enough of a wide array of potential implications with similar import are true or probably true, although she does not know which these are (hence, they are weak implications) and is neither able to anticipate nor particularly concerned about which of them will be considered and accepted by the audience (hence, they are weakly implicated). We have argued that the cognitive effects achieved by conveying such a wide range of weak implicatures are iden- tiﬁable as poetic effects (Sperber & Wilson, 1995, chap. 4, section 6; Pilkington, 2000). The production of genuinely relevant poetic effects can be a powerfully creative form of language use (creative on the part of both communicator and audience). Effects of this type can be created by literal, loose, or metaphorical forms of expression. Thus, classical Japanese haikus, which are among the most effective forms of poetry in world literature, typically involve a literal use of language. Consider Bash¯o’s famous haiku (written in 1680): On a leaﬂess bough A crow is perched – The autumn dusk. (Translated by Joan Giroux, 1974) This simple, literal description weakly impli- cates a wide array of implications which combine to depict a landscape, a season, a moment of the day, a mood, and so on, thereby achieving a powerful overall effect which varies to some extent from reader to reader. By contrast, many metaphors are not par- ticularly poetic. We are thinking here not so much of conventional metaphors which may have lost their poetic appeal, if they ever had one (was the phrase “legs of a table” ever poetic?) as of less conventional but not par- ticularly creative metaphors used to high- light a simple idea rather than suggest a complex one. Consider (40), a political com- ment on the Bush administration’s handling of the 2005 Katrina hurricane, compared to its handling of the 2001 terrorist attack on the United States: (40) Well, if 9/11 is one bookend of the Bush administration, Katrina may be the other. If 9/11 put the wind at Pres- ident Bush’s back, Katrina’s put the wind in his face. If the Bush-Cheney team seemed to be the right guys to deal with Osama, they seem exactly the wrong guys to deal with Katrina (Thomas Friedman, New York Times, September 7, 2005) Here, the use of the metaphors “bookend” and “wind” to suggest opposing forces at two ends of a continuum (a case of force dynam- ics `a la Talmy) is so ﬂat that most readers are likely to bypass the obvious relation- ship between the wind and an explosion, on the one hand, and still more obviously, between the wind and a hurricane, on the other: the cognitive effects derivable from this relationship are unlikely to have been intended, and are hardly worth the effort.\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 101 Nonetheless, these metaphors serve to make the author’s point, which is deﬁnitely not of a poetic nature. Although metaphors are neither neces- sary nor sufﬁcient for the creation of gen- uine poetic effects, they are particularly well suited to this purpose, for several reasons. Consider, ﬁrst, a trivial case of metaphor such as (41): (41) Woman to uncouth suitor: Keep your paws off me! Here, “your paws” refers unproblematically to the hearer’s hands. Use of the word “paws” also activates related notions, conceptions, and images having to do with animal paws, clumsiness, bestiality, and so on. From a relevance theory perspective, the fact that these ideas have been activated suggests that they may be relevant, and the effort spent in activating them, however marginal, sug- gests that they should be relevant (otherwise, the effort would have been wasted, contrary to the presumption of optimal relevance). While there is a wide range of possible impli- catures which might contribute to the rele- vance of the utterance (that the addressee is clumsy, gross, lusting like a beast, and so on), none of them is strongly implicated by the speaker. We claim that they are weakly implicated: the hearer is indeed encouraged to consider at least some of them and see them as part of the speaker’s meaning. It is these vague effects that make the use of “paws” marginally more relevant than the use of “hands.” According to classical rhetoric, the lit- eral meaning of the word “paw” is replaced in (41) by the ﬁgurative meaning HAND. In more recent approaches based on category extension, the literal meaning of “paw” is extended to include any EXTREMITY OF A LIMB (whether animal or human). In both analyses – substitution of a ﬁgurative mean- ing disjoint from the literal one, or inclusion of the linguistically speciﬁed denotation in a broader “ﬁgurative” denotation – suggestions of clumsiness and bestiality are added to the ﬁgurative meaning as “connotations” of the word “paw.” Here, “connotations” are associ- ations in a strictly associationist sense: they are grounded in past co-occurrence and can go in any direction. In fact, the word “paw” has many asso- ciations other than clumsiness and bestial- ity which might be activated in a metaphor, from the softness of a cat’s paw to the strength of a lion’s. Association of the type appealed to in associationist psychology is a process which is too vague, on the one hand, and too powerful, on the other, to account for the subtlety and directional- ity of weak implicatures. As noted above, we would rather appeal only to associations based on properly inferential relationships and, more generally, stick to an inferential rather than associationist account of com- prehension. In (41), the alleged connotations are associated to the literal meaning of “paw” (i.e., PAW), and not to its ﬁgurative mean- ing HAND or EXTREMITY OF A LIMB. From an inferential point of view, the idea that the literal meaning of “paw” is discarded while its connotations remain is even more puzzling than the smile of the Cheshire cat: the cat’s smile lingers at an empty location, whereas the connotations of the literal meaning of “paw” are supposed to adorn the ﬁgurative meaning that has replaced it. The alternative analysis we favour is the one we have been defending throughout this chapter. In processing (41), the hearer develops (in parallel) tentative interpreta- tions of the explicit and implicit compo- nents of the speaker’s meaning, and stops when they ﬁt together in the sense that the explicit content contextually implies the implicated conclusions, and the explicit con- tent and implicit content jointly satisfy the hearer’s expectations of relevance. Given that the relationship between explicit con- tent and implicit content is properly infer- ential, and given the nature of the mutual adjustment process used to determine these contents, the implications evoked by the decoded senses of the words used in the utterance must be genuine implications: that is, they must hold at least part of the exten- sion of the decoded senses. The ad hoc con- cepts constructed to carry these implications will then at least overlap with the concepts encoded by the utterance (otherwise, we\n102 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON would be dealing with purely association- ist rather than inferential relations). Since the concepts PAW and HAND have disjoint extensions, we claim that “paw” in (41) could not be used to convey the meaning HAND. Nor can it be used to convey EXTREMITY OF A LIMB, since this broadened concept is not speciﬁc enough to contextually imply clum- siness, bestiality, and so on. We assume that the ad hoc concepts built on the basis of most metaphorical terms are genuinely ad hoc: that is, they are adjusted to the precise circumstances of their use and are therefore unlikely to be paraphrasable by an ordinary language expression. This is why we resort to the “*” notation, and represent the concept pragmatically con- veyed by “paw” in (41) as PAW*. PAW* is the most easily constructed concept whose extension includes the hearer’s hands, and which carries the weak contextual implica- tions generally true of prototypical paws: that they are used clumsily, grossly, and so on. These weak implications are them- selves weakly implicated: that is, they are weakly intended by the speaker. The utter- ance on this interpretation achieves opti- mal relevance by making a strong explicit request that the hearer remove his PAWS* and weakly implicating that he is behav- ing clumsily and grossly. PAW*, so construed, involves both a broadening and a narrowing of PAW, as do most ad hoc meanings con- veyed by metaphorical uses. So even a common metaphor such as “Keep your paws off me!” achieves some of its relevance through an array of weak implicatures: a poetic touch, however mod- est. In more creative metaphors, relevance may depend to a much greater extent (or even entirely) on such weak implicatures, in a way that makes it quite appropriate to talk of “poetic effects.” Consider the full version of Carl Sandburg’s poem “Fog,” whose ﬁrst two lines are one of the most widely quoted examples of creative metaphor: The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor and city on silent haunches and then moves on. “On little cat feet” evokes an array of implications having to do with silence, smoothness, stealth. Taken together with the following four lines, the phrase evokes a movement which appears both arbitrary and yet composed, so that it is tempting to see it not as random but rather as guided by mysterious dispositions. Poems are read and re-read. On a second reading, the interpre- tation of the whole poem provides part of the context in which the ﬁrst two lines are understood. Not unlike Bash¯o’s literal haiku, Sandburg’s extended metaphor weakly implicates an ever-widening array of impli- cations which combine to depict a place, an atmosphere, a mood, achieving a pow- erful overall effect that varies from reader to reader and reading to reading. It is not part of the explicit content of the poem that the fog comes silently, or smoothly, or stealthily. Rather, what is part of the explicit content is that the fog comes ON-LITTLE-CAT-FEET*. And what is this concept? It is the concept of a property that is difﬁcult or impossible to deﬁne, a property possessed in particular by some typical movements of cats (though not all of them – little cat feet can also move in violent or playful ways) and, according to the poem, by the movement of fog. How is this ad hoc concept ON-LITTLE-CAT-FEET* arrived at? By taking the poet to be attribut- ing to the coming of the fog that property which contextually implies the very ideas suggested by the phrase “little cat feet.” The example of Sandburg’s poem should help to clarify how and why metaphors are indeed particularly likely to achieve opti- mal relevance through the creation of poetic effects: the effort required for ad hoc con- cept construction calls for matching effects, and given the freedom left to the inter- preter in the construction process, these effects are unlikely to consist in just a few strongly implicated strong implications. It is not that concept construction system- atically demands more effort in the case of metaphors (see Gibbs 1994a; Noveck, Bianco, & Castry, 2001). Many metaphors\nA DEFLATIONARY ACCOUNT OF METAPHORS 103 are very easy to process, while, as any science student knows, arriving at an adequate literal understanding of a statement may take much more effort than a loose or even a metaphor- ical construal. Nor is it that literal expression is intrinsically less capable than metaphor of achieving poetic effects, as the compar- ison between Bash¯o’s haiku and Sandburg’s haiku-like poem shows. It is just that, on the whole, the closer one gets to the metaphor end of the literal/loose/metaphorical con- tinuum, the greater the freedom of inter- pretation left to hearers or readers, and the more likely it is that relevance will be achieved through a wide array of weak implicatures: that is, through poetic effects. So when you compare metaphors to other uses of words, you ﬁnd a bit more of this and a bit less of that, but nothing deserv- ing of a special theory, let alone a grand one. Notes 1 See, for instance, Lakoff and Johnson (1980); Lakoff (1987, 1994); Lakoff and Turner (1989); Talmy (2000); Fauconnier (1997); Fauconnier and Turner (2002); Glucks- berg (2001); Kintsch (2000); Sperber and Wilson (1985/1986, 1995); Carston (1997, 2002); Wilson and Sperber (2002). 2 See Gibbs (1994a, 1994b, 1998) and also his debate with Gregory Murphy (Gibbs, 1996; Murphy, 1996, 1997). 3 Some authors (e.g. David Lewis, 1975) believe that ﬁgurative meanings are linguis- tically encoded rather than pragmatically inferred; however, this vastly increases both the ambiguity of language and its gross defec- tiveness as a code. 4 For many (perhaps most) speakers of English today, “temperature” may be ambiguous between a general sense and a narrower one equivalent to fever. For these speakers, “temperature” in (8) would have to be dis- ambiguated rather than narrowed. Histori- cally, however, this narrower linguistic mean- ing will have been lexicalised as a result of repeated pragmatic narrowings of a single general meaning. In this case, and in others where a narrowed or broadened meaning of a term may have undergone lexicalisation, we are discussing how it would be interpreted in dialects where it has not yet become lex- icalised. In fact, far from being an objection to a pragmatic account, the frequent occur- rence of lexicalised narrowings and broaden- ings of lexical meanings calls for a pragmatic account as a crucial component of historical lexicology. 5 Strictly speaking, only propositions have implications. When we talk (as we will) of a concept’s having implications, we have in mind the implications that propositions carry in virtue of having this concept as a con- stituent. 6 On the notion of a literal interpretation, see Sperber and Wilson (1995, chap. 4, sections 6 and 7). On this account, when a metaphori- cal use becomes lexicalised, an interpretation that requires the presence of exactly this con- cept in the explicit content will be strictly literal. 7 It might be argued that a stretch of land is ﬂat in a second, lexicalised sense if every point on its surface is at the same distance from the centre of the earth (rather than being on a plane), so that someone can travel across it without going upwards or downwards. A problem for this view is that the statement “If all the land on earth were at sea level, the earth would be ﬂat” should then be true on one reading, whereas in fact it seems simply false. 8 This intuition underlies many classical rhetor- ical treatments and also appears to motivate Grice’s account (Grice, 1989, p. 34). 9 The distinction between literal and nonliteral utterances may be relevant to normative con- cerns, as in law, for instance (see Wilson & Sperber, 2002, section 7). 10 See, for instance, Martinich (1984); Tour- angeau and Rips (1991); Becker (1997); Gineste, Indurkhya, and Scart (2000); Carston (2002); Vega Moreno (2004, 2007); Wilson and Carston (2006). 11 For an interesting proposal to account for emergent properties by augmenting the relevance-theoretic account with the machin- ery of domain mappings, see Gibbs and Ten- dahl (2006). The relations between “domain mapping” accounts of metaphor and fully inferential accounts deserve fuller explo- ration than we can give them here. For now, we simply note that if emergent properties can be derived using only the independently motivated inferential mechanisms outlined above, then domain mappings may be best\n104 DAN SPERBER AND DEIRDRE WILSON seen as a result of, rather than a prerequi- site to, metaphor interpretation, and as con- tributing to the interpretation process on the effort side, by altering the accessibility of con- textual assumptions and implications, rather than playing the central role assigned to them in most cognitive linguistic accounts (see Wilson & Carston, 2006). 12 In fact, most contextual implications are typ- ically made probable rather than certain by a premise that contextually implies them, since the implication is contingent on the truth of other contextual premises that are generally less than certain. Implying some conclusion with certainty may be seen as a limiting case of strongest possible contextual implication (see Sperber & Wilson, 1995, chap. 2). 13 Actually, even in this case, you would have to estimate how precise your answer should be in order to be optimally relevant: could you spare your hearer some processing effort without any loss on the effect side by round- ing the time to the nearest multiple of ﬁve minutes, or would it be preferable in the cir- cumstances to be accurate to the minute? And from the hearer’s perspective, would it be better in the circumstances to take an answer such as “It’s ten past ﬁve” as an approx- imation or as accurate to the minute? In most ordinary situations, mutual adjustment of the explicit content and the implicit presumption of relevance will yield an interpretation in which the response is understood as rounded (see van der Henst, Carles, & Sperber, 2002). 14 Incidentally, we believe that pragmatic approaches that idealise away differences in the strength of implicatures (as most do) are ignoring a central aspect of language use.

Not surprisingly, this richness has engen- dered a number of approaches to metaphor (Steen, 2007). Our approach to metaphor centers on the question of how metaphors are pro- cessed. This approach uniﬁes metaphor with processes of analogy and similarity. We use structure-mapping, a theory of analogy and similarity,1 as our framework. In the ﬁrst part of the chapter, we describe research that shows that the real-time processing of many metaphors and similes can be cap- tured by detailed models from analogy. Then we turn to studies of the processing of large-scale conceptual metaphors such as Love is a journey and present evidence that such metaphors can be seen as extended structure-mappings between domains. In the second part, we lay out the “career of metaphor” hypothesis, which considers the evolution of ﬁgurative statements. We review evidence in support of the claim that ﬁgurative statements begin as novel compar- ison statements and evolve gradually into category-inclusion statements as the base (or vehicle) terms develop an associated metaphorical abstraction. Metaphor Is Like Analogy An analogy is a mapping between two represented2 situations in which common relational structure is aligned (Gentner, 1983; Gentner & Markman, 1997; Holyoak, Gentner, & Kokinov, 2001). According to structure-mapping theory, analogical map- ping is a process of establishing a struc- tural alignment between two represented situations and then projecting inferences3 (Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989; Gentner & Markman, 1997; Markman & Gentner, 1993). An alignment consists of an explicit set of correspondences between the representational elements of the two 109\n110 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE situations with an emphasis on rela- tional matches. The alignment is deter- mined according to structural consistency constraints: (1) one-to-one correspondence between the mapped elements in the base and target and (2) parallel connectivity, in which the arguments of corresponding pred- icates also correspond. In addition, the selec- tion of an alignment is guided by the sys- tematicity principle: a matching system of relations connected by higher-order con- straining relations such as causal relations is preferred over a match with an equal number of independent correspondences. Once the alignment is made, further candi- date inferences are spontaneously projected from base to target (Falkenhainer et al., 1989). Systematicity also guides analogical inference: people do not import random facts from base to target but instead project inferences that complete the common sys- tem of relations (Bowdle & Gentner, 1997; Clement & Gentner, 1991). Two analogy ﬁndings are particularly relevant for metaphor. The ﬁrst is evidence demonstrating the systematicity preference: people implicitly prefer analogies that share large, deep relational structures (all else being equal) (Forbus, Gentner, & Law, 1995; Gentner, Rattermann, & Forbus, 1993); and the same is true for metaphors. A major determinant of aptness in metaphor is the presence of a substantial relational match (Gentner & Clement, 1988; Gentner & Wolff, 1997). The second is that the common system derived from a comparison becomes more salient after the comparison and more available for transfer to new con- texts (Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Loewen- stein & Gentner, 2001). Thus, the process of comparison, including metaphorical comparison, is a way of deriving new abstractions. Of course, not all metaphors are analo- gies (see Gentner, 1982, for discussion). Metaphors can range from purely relational comparisons (analogies), as in (1), to purely attributional comparisons, as in (2); and some metaphors, such as (3), simply defy description in terms of alignment. 1. Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet. 2. His eyes were deep pools of misery. 3. The voice of your eyes is deeper than all the roses. (e. e. cummings) Most of the metaphors studied in the psy- chological literature are analogies – that is, they convey chieﬂy relational commonali- ties (e.g., Encyclopedias are gold mines, My job is a jail) – though some are surface matches (e.g., Hair is like spaghetti). Finally, a bit of terminology: in naming the parts of a ﬁgura- tive statement such as “An X is (like) a Y,” X is the topic (or target in the terminology of analogy), and Y is the vehicle (or base, or source in analogical terminology). Aptness and relationality. Adults in gen- eral prefer relational metaphors, as noted in the previous section. Gentner and Clement (1988) had participants write our descriptions of objects and then interpret metaphors containing those objects (e.g., Blood vessels are aqueducts). Whereas the object descriptions contained both object attributes (e.g., that blood vessels are red, elastic, delicate) and relations (e.g., they carry blood through the body), the metaphor interpretations focused mainly on relations (e.g., both aqueducts and blood vessels transport something needed; they bring it to far parts of the system). More importantly, Gentner and Clement (1988) found that subjects’ judgments of the apt- ness of metaphors were positively correlated with the relationality of their interpretations of those metaphors, and negatively corre- lated with the degree to which their inter- pretations relied on simple object proper- ties. Thus, although relationality is not the only inﬂuence on aptness (e.g., novelty and ﬁt with prior beliefs may enter in), still, to a large degree, people consider metaphors apt to the extent that they can ﬁnd relational interpretations for them. The processing of metaphors. Structure- mapping makes a number of predic- tions about the processing of individual metaphors that should follow if metaphors are processed like analogies. SME serves as a process model to motivate these predic- tions. SME, the structure-mapping engine\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 111 Stage 1 Local matches Target Stage 2 Structural coalescence into consistent mappings Stage 3 Small structures combined into maximal interpretation; candidate inferences Figure 6.1. SME’s three stages of mapping. (Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989; Forbus, Ferguson, & Gentner, 1994; For- bus, Gentner, & Law, 1995) utilizes a local- to-global4 alignment process to arrive at a structural alignment of two representations. Figure 6.1 shows SME’s three stages of map- ping. In the ﬁrst stage, SME begins blind and local by matching all identical predi- cates in the two representations. Semantic similarity is captured through partial iden- tities: e.g., give and donate both contain the subpredicate “transfer possession” (see Gen- tner & Kurtz, 2006; Yan, Forbus, & Gentner, 2003). This initial mapping is typically inc- onsistent, containing many-to-one matches. In the second phase, these local matches are coalesced into structurally consistent con- nected clusters (called kernels). The kernels are essentially partial mappings – connected sets of structurally consistent correspond- ing base–target pairs. They are given struc- tural evaluations that depend not only on the sheer number of predicates but also on the depth of the kernel’s relational system (Forbus & Gentner, 1989). In the third stage, the kernels are merged into one or a few structurally consistent global interpretations (mappings displaying one-to-one correspondences and parallel con- nectivity). SME does not produce all possible interpretations (a psychologically implausi- ble process); instead, it uses a greedy merge algorithm (Forbus & Oblinger, 1990) that operates in linear time over the number of kernels. It begins with the maximal ker- nel and then adds the largest kernel that is\n112 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE structurally consistent with the ﬁrst one, continuing until no more kernels can be added without compromising consistency. It then carries out this process beginning with the second largest kernel to produce a sec- ond interpretation. SME then produces a structural evalua- tion of the interpretation(s), using a kind of cascade-like algorithm in which evidence is passed down from predicates to their argu- ments. This method is used – both here and for the individual kernel evaluations mentioned previously – because it favors deep systems over shallow systems, even given equal numbers of matches (Forbus & Gentner, 1989). Up to this point, the pro- cessing has been a role-neutral process of alignment. Now, however, a directional inference process takes place. Predicates connected to the common structure in the base, but not initially present in the target, are projected as candidate inferences in the target. Thus, structural completion can lead to spontaneous unplanned inferences. SME has several appealing features as applied to metaphor. First, it begins blindly, without needing to know the point of the comparison in advance. Second, SME can simultaneously derive two interpretations of a comparison (e.g., a literal and a metaphori- cal interpretation). Because metaphor is pro- cessed in the same way as literal compar- ison, there is no need to initiate a special metaphoric processing routine. (Some the- ories implicitly postulate different processes for metaphor than for literal language, lead- ing to a knotty problem: you have to know that a statement is a metaphor in order to process it; but you have to process it to know that it is a metaphor.) Third, inference occurs as a natural outcome of comparison, ﬁtting the psychological intuition that infer- ences often arise unbidden from metaphors, and may even surprise the reasoner. Stages of processing. This framework gives rise to a number of processing predictions, of which we focus on these: r Metaphor comprehension begins with a symmetric (nondirectional) alignment process. r If an alignment is found, then fur- ther inferences are directionally projected from base to target. r Thus, directionality in metaphor compre- hension arises after the initial stage of pro- cessing. The assertion that metaphor is initially nondirectional is highly counterintuitive because, as Ortony (1979) pointed out, strong directionality is one of the hall- marks of metaphors. However, Gentner and Wolff (1997, 2000; Wolff & Gentner, 2000) have found evidence for these predictions. In one set of studies, Wolff and Gentner (2000) used the metaphor interference tech- nique initially developed by Glucksberg, Gildea, and Bookin (1982) to investigate very early processing during metaphor com- prehension. Glucksberg et al. had found that when participants made true–false judg- ments among statements like Some birds are robins and Some birds are apples, they took longer to reject metaphors (e.g., Some brains are warehouses) than to reject ordinary false statements (Some birds are warehouses), indi- cating that metaphor processing is initiated before literal processing has terminated. Wolff and Gentner (2000) applied this metaphor interference technique to inves- tigate early processing: speciﬁcally, to ask whether forward and reversed metaphors differ in the early processing stages. For forward metaphors, the results replicated Glucksberg et al.’s interference effect: for- ward metaphors (Some suburbs are para- sites) took longer to reject than anomalous statements. The key question is the reversed metaphors. If metaphor is processed by a symmetric alignment, then the reversed metaphors will initially behave exactly like the forward metaphors. But if the terms of the metaphor are processed differently from the start, as in Glucksberg’s attributive cat- egory theory, then reversed metaphors will not show an interference effect.5 Importantly, however, Wolff and Gen- tner found precisely the same interfer- ence effects for reversed metaphors as for forward metaphors, supporting the claim of an early nondirectional alignment\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 113 process. These ﬁndings held even though the metaphors had highly conventional vehicle terms – such as parasites. These results are consistent with the structure-mapping claim that the initial processes in metaphor com- prehension are symmetric alignment pro- cesses. Wolff and Gentner also veriﬁed that the metaphors in the above study were strongly directional. When participants were simply asked to judge the comprehensibility of the metaphors (rather than to assess literal truth values), (1) as predicted, forward metaphors were far more likely to be judged compre- hensible than reversed metaphors; and (2) as expected, response times were considerably longer than in the true–false task. These ﬁnd- ings are consistent with the claim that even for highly directional metaphors, direction- ality emerges later in processing. In a further study, Wolff and Gentner (in preparation) used a deadline task to exam- ine stages of processing. Participants were shown forward (e.g., “A rumor is a virus”) and reversed (e.g., “A virus is a rumor”) metaphors and asked for comprehensibil- ity judgments. Consistent with a symmet- ric early alignment process, comprehensi- bility judgments for forward and reversed metaphors did not differ early in processing; even though (as noted just above) forward metaphors were judged far more compre- hensible than reversed metaphors later in processing. Overall, the ﬁndings suggest an early symmetric alignment process followed by a directional inference process. Extended mappings. The structure-map- ping view of metaphor extends naturally to extended metaphors. Structure-mapping predicts that people can process extended metaphors and can incrementally extend such mappings (Gentner, 1982; Forbus, Fer- guson, & Gentner, 1994; Keane & Brayshaw, 1988). This interpretation is also consonant with domain-mapping theories such as that of Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) and Tourangeau and Sternberg (1981) and with theory (e.g., Kittay & Lehrer, 1981; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and research suggesting that metaphors are processed as large-scale con- ceptual systems (Gibbs, 1990, 1994; Gibbs, Nayak, & Cutting, 1989). In contrast, local- ist theories – such as the attributional cat- egory account (Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990; Glucksberg, McGlone, & Manfredi, 1997), which views metaphors as category inclu- sions – have no natural way of handling extended metaphors. Gentner and Boronat tested whether extended metaphors are processed on-line as domain mappings (Boronat, 1990; Gentner & Boronat, 1992, Gentner, Bowdle, Wolff, & Boronat, 2001; Gentner, 1992). Speciﬁcally, our studies tested for a metaphoric consis- tency effect – a rise in response time when there is a shift in mapping from one base to another, even where the target and even the inferred meaning are equated. Our method was inspired by the mixed metaphors fre- quently captured by The New Yorker, for example, It seems that at every turn now in my campaign, I am confronted with my fellow Republicans stabbing me in the back. and The U.S. and the Middle East are on par- allel but non-converging paths. If people comprehend metaphors by set- ting up structurally consistent, systematic domain mappings, then a shift of metaphoric base should create a disruption in the map- ping process, and lead to slower process- ing. We used this mixed metaphor tech- nique to test whether people can carry out an extended metaphorical mapping. All the experiments followed the same logic (see Figure 6.2). There were three kinds of passages: those with a consistent metaphoric mapping, those with an inconsis- tent metaphoric mapping, and a literal control. The consistent passages utilized the same base throughout; for the inconsistent pas- sages, the base was switched at the last sentence. The three passages all had the same story line, and all shared the same last sentence – the target sentence (always metaphorical), on which reading times were collected. The passages differed in the main body of the text. In the consistent passages, the same global metaphor was used in the\n114 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE CONSISTENT METAPHOR Debate as race INCONSISTENT METAPHOR Debate as war LITERAL CONTROL (race terms used literally) His skill left his opponent far behind him at the finish line. Figure 6.2. Design of the domain-mapping study (Boronat, 1990; Gentner & Boronat, 1992). passage’s body as in the target sentence; but in the inconsistent passages, a different global metaphor was used in the body, so that the target sentence required a switch to a new metaphor (though it expressed the same idea). In the literal controls, the body contained all of the metaphoric terms of the corresponding within-domain passages, but these terms were used literally.6 For example, there were three versions of a story about a debate (see Figure 6.2). The consistent passage used the global metaphor A DEBATE IS A RACE (e.g., he had to steer his course carefully in the competition). The inconsistent passage used the global metaphor A DEBATE IS A WAR (e.g., he had to use every weapon at his command in the com- petition). For both passages, the last sentence used the RACE metaphor (e.g., His skill left his opponent far behind him at the ﬁnish line). For the consistent passage, this represented a continuation of the global metaphor. How- ever, for the inconsistent passage, the crit- ical ﬁnal sentence made a switch from the DEBATE AS WAR metaphor to the DEBATE AS RACE metaphor. The domain-mapping hypothesis pre- dicts that the last sentence will be read more quickly when it continues the same metaphoric mapping as that in the passage than when the global metaphor is changed (i.e., faster in the consistent condition than in the inconsistent condition), because the former extends an established base-to-target mapping, while the latter disrupts it. In short, the domain-mapping account predicts that the critical test metaphors will be read faster in the consistent condition than in the inconsistent condition. In contrast, local- ist metaphor theories, such as the class- inclusion theory of Glucksberg and Keysar (1990) and Glucksberg, McGlone, and Man- fredi (1997), would predict no difference between the two metaphoric conditions, since the key (metaphoric) sentence is the same. In the ﬁrst two studies, we used novel ﬁguratives from existing conceptual map- pings. The results showed a metaphoric con- sistency effect, consistent with the domain- mapping account: Subjects read the critical last sentence signiﬁcantly faster when it extended the existing mapping (consis- tent version) than when it switched the metaphoric mapping (inconsistent version). The critical last sentence was also read faster following the metaphorically consistent pas- sage than it was following the matched lit- eral control passage, ruling out the possi- bility that the reading time advantage for the metaphorically consistent passages could be attributed to mere associative priming between the words in the passage and the words in the ﬁnal sentence. The evidence thus supports the domain- mapping hypothesis for novel ﬁguratives.\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 115 However, the results were quite different for conventional ﬁguratives. In two further studies, Gentner and Boronat utilized pas- sages that contained conventional ﬁgura- tives, often from the same global concep- tual metaphors as the novel ﬁguratives in the earlier studies7 – for example, DEBATE AS WAR – but here the individual metaphors were conventional. When the individual metaphors were highly conventional, the metaphoric con- sistency effect disappeared (Gentner & Boronat, 1992; see also Keysar, Shen, Glucks- berg, & Horton, 2000). There was no apparent cost of shifting between global metaphors. This suggests that the local- ist account may be correct for conven- tional ﬁguratives: for highly conventional metaphors, the metaphorical interpretation becomes an alternate word sense, and the metaphor can then be processed on a lex- ical basis. However, one must go beyond sentence-by-sentence processing to account for the global mapping effects found for the novel ﬁguratives. Directional asymmetry: How can a com- parison approach account for the strong direc- tionality of metaphors? People show strong directional preferences in metaphor. For example, (1) seems far better as a metaphor than does (2): 1. Some jobs are jails. 2. Some jails are jobs. The strong directionality of metaphors has been used to argue that metaphors are essentially class-inclusion statements (which are clearly asymmetric) rather than compar- isons. But research on analogy shows robust asymmetries in analogy and similarity as well. In processing analogy and metaphor, the initial symmetric alignment process is followed by directional inferences. Further, because inferences are understood to ﬂow from base to target, people prefer compari- son statements that have the more informa- tive term in the base position. Bowdle and Gentner (1997) explored asymmetry in comparison by giving partici- pants two brief narrative passages that were similar except that one passage (the sys- tematic passage) contained a causal struc- ture linking the events, and the other (the nonsystematic passage) did not. Participants preferred the direction of comparison that placed the systematic passage in the base; and when asked to generate inferences from one passage to the other, they overwhelm- ingly drew inferences from the more system- atic passage to the less systematic one. These ﬁndings show that asymmetry in analogy fol- lows naturally from a preference for rich inferential potential. Notably, this strong asymmetry only occurred for alignable pairs of passages. When the passages were unre- lated, participants had no order preference, and simply drew inferences independently from within one passage or the other. We suggest that this preference for hav- ing the more systematic representation as the base can explain the directional asym- metry of metaphor. Indeed, as Bowdle and Gentner (1997) suggested, systematicity imbalance is likely to be far stronger for metaphor than for literal similarity, with a concomitantly greater directional asymme- try. This would ﬁt with the human predilec- tion for metaphors that draw on highly familiar domains, such as spatial relations and bodily force dynamics – domains that are understood well enough to provide inferen- tial structure for other domains (Fauconnier & Turner, 1998; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). The Career of Metaphor Novel and conventional ﬁguratives differ in their behavior. Consider ﬁrst a novel metaphoric base term, snowﬂake. With- out being paired with a target, it is dif- ﬁcult to guess what meaning the term might be used to metaphorically convey. When paired with a target, however, the meaning becomes clear. For example, the metaphor Children are snowﬂakes conveys that each child is unique. Further, pair- ing a novel base with different targets can lead to different abstractions. For example, the metaphor Accolades are snowﬂakes con- veys that praise is ephemeral. In general, novel metaphoric bases do not automatically\n116 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE evoke metaphoric categories in isolation. Further, the fact that they can take on radi- cally different meanings in different contexts suggests that the comprehension of novel metaphors involves a comparison between the two terms. Consider next a conventional metaphoric base term, gold mine. Even when it is not paired with a target, the hearer can already guess the metaphoric meaning of this term: something that is a source of something valu- able. Further, pairing this base with a range of different targets (e.g., an encyclopedia, the World Wide Web, a shopping mall, even the backyard) does not substantially alter its meaning. Unlike novel bases, conven- tional bases can automatically evoke stable metaphoric categories. These observations, together with Wolff and Gentner’s ﬁndings, led us to propose a theoretical framework for ﬁgurative pro- cessing that takes into account the effects of conventionalization. We have called this theory the career of metaphor (Bowdle, 1998; Bowdle & Gentner, 1995, 1999, 2005; Gent- ner & Bowdle, 2001; Gentner & Wolff, 1997; Wolff & Gentner, 2000). According to the career of metaphor hypothesis, a metaphor undergoes a process of gradual abstraction and conventionalization as it evolves from its ﬁrst novel use to becoming a conventional “stock” metaphor. This process results in a shift in mode of alignment. Novel metaphors are processed as comparisons, in which the target concept is structurally aligned with the literal base concept. But each such align- ment makes the abstraction more salient, so if a given base is used repeatedly in a parallel way, it accrues a metaphoric abstraction as a secondary sense of the base term. When a base term reaches a level of conventional- ity such that its associated abstract schema becomes sufﬁciently accessible, the term can function as a category name. Importantly, on our account, the basic process for understanding a ﬁgurative state- ment remains the same – an initial struc- tural alignment followed by the directional projection of inferences (and sometimes by re-representation). What changes with conventionalization is not the process itself but the representation of the base term, whose metaphorical abstraction becomes more salient and more accessible. As the base term develops a clear metaphorical abstrac- tion that can be accessed during compre- hension, a kind of short cut becomes avail- able. The listener can access the abstract metaphorical sense directly instead of having to derive it by aligning the two literal terms. Thus, the alignment process shifts from a horizontal alignment – that is, a comparison between two literal meanings – to a vertical alignment – that is, a comparison between a concrete literal meaning (for the target term) and an abstraction (for the base term). In general, aligning with an abstraction is eas- ier than aligning with a more concrete rep- resentation (e.g., Ross, 1989), because there are fewer inconsistent predicates. Therefore, as conventionalization occurs there will be a corresponding decrease in comprehension time (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005). Metaphor and category formation. While novel metaphors do not depend on the appli- cation of metaphoric categories, they may be used to create such categories. According to the career of metaphor hypothesis, novel and conventional metaphors draw on different representations and, hence, involve different comprehension strategies: novel metaphors are processed by direct comparison, whereas conventional metaphors are processed by accessing the metaphorical abstraction and applying it (via structural alignment) to the target – essentially treating the base term as a category of which the target is an instance. This shift from horizontal to ver- tical alignment is not coincidental; rather, it is a natural consequence of the structural alignment process used to interpret novel metaphors. Consider again how novel metaphors are processed according to structure-mapping theory. First, the target and base are placed in structural correspondence. Second, fur- ther predicates connected to the aligned sys- tem in the base are mapped to the tar- get as candidate inferences, which then count as further correspondences. One out- come of this process is that the resultant system of commonalities is highlighted.\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 117 Both the common system and the set of related inferences become more salient and more likely to be used in future situations. This process of highlighting and abstrac- tion is also seen in studies of analogical rea- soning in which learners appear to induce problem schemas as a result of structural alignment (e.g., Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Loewenstein & Gentner, 2001; Novick & Holyoak, 1991; Ross & Kennedy, 1990). It is also consistent with abstraction models of category learning (e.g., Elio & Anderson, 1981). Further, because structural alignment favors connected relational systems (Bowdle & Gentner, 1997; Clement & Gentner, 1991; Gentner & Medina, 1998), the abstractions that arise are often relational systems that have explanatory power. On this view, when a given concept is encountered as the base of a metaphor for the ﬁrst time, it does not evoke a metaphoric category independently of the target; rather, the category emerges from the alignment of the target and base. However, if the same abstraction is derived repeatedly in the context of the base, it may become conventionally associated with that term and may eventually be lexicalized as a sec- ondary meaning of the base term. Only once a base term reaches this level of con- ventionality does it achieve dual represen- tation of the type described by Glucks- berg and Keysar (1990). This account is in line with Swinney and Cutler’s (1979) lexical representation hypothesis, according to which idioms and other conventional- ized “stock” expressions have stable nonlit- eral meanings that can be accessed directly without needing to be derived anew. This hypothesis is supported by ﬁndings indicat- ing that the nonliteral meanings of idioms (Cacciari & Tabossi, 1988; Gibbs, 1980, 1994; Gibbs & O’Brien, 1990) and conventional- ized metaphors (Blank, 1988; Blasko & Con- nine, 1993; Swinney & Cutler, 1979) are pro- cessed as fast, or faster, than their literal meanings. As Giora (1997) has persuasively argued, whenever a term is associated with more than one meaning, the most salient of these meanings will typically dominate dur- ing comprehension, even if this meaning is ﬁgurative rather than literal. Evidence for the career of metaphor hypothesis has mounted over the past decade. As discussed earlier in this chap- ter, Gentner and Wolff (1997) found that only when the base terms of metaphors were highly conventional did they prime metaphor comprehension more effectively than the target terms. More generally, it has repeatedly been demonstrated that conven- tional metaphors are processed more quickly and automatically than novel metaphors (e.g., Blank, 1988; Gildea & Glucksberg, 1983; Martin, 1992). This pattern buttresses the conclusion that conventionalization results in a shift in metaphor processing from on-line active interpretation to retrieval of stored meanings (Bowdle & Gentner, 1995, 1999, 2005; Gentner et al., 2001; Gentner & Wolff, 1997; Wolff & Gentner, 2000). An important implication of the career of metaphor framework is that metaphors can indeed give rise to new categories but only over time, as they become conventionalized. Thus, the career of metaphor view agrees in part (but not entirely) with Glucksberg and Keysar’s (1990) category-inclusion model. In their original theory, the base or vehi- cle gives rise to a metaphoric category that is either already associated with or newly derived from the base term. Our evidence supports the ﬁrst claim but not the second: a metaphor can be processed as a cate- gory statement if there is already an abstrac- tion associated with the base; but otherwise, comparison of the two literal representations is necessary, and the abstraction emerges from the alignment process. Thus, highly conventional metaphors can indeed serve as category statements, but novel metaphors in general do not. Degrees of conventionalization. This evo- lution can be described in terms of four stages of conventionalization, as shown in Figure 6.3. In a novel metaphor (as dis- cussed earlier), the base concept has no stan- dard metaphorical category attached to it, although the comparison between base and target will promote the formation of such a category. In a conventional metaphor, the\n118 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE lit eral concept lit eral concept Novel M etaph o r target base lit eral concept lit eral concept Conventional M etaphor target base m etaphoric categor y lit eral concept lit eral concept Dead 1 M etaphor target base m etaphoric categor y lit eral concept Dead 2 M etaph o r target base m etaphoric categor y Figure 6.3. Living and dead metaphors. base refers simultaneously to a literal con- cept and to a metaphoric category. Typically, the relationship between these senses is clearly recognizable: for example, the term river (as in Time is a river) has two associ- ated senses: namely, a large stream of ﬂow- ing water and anything that moves contin- uously forward. For these kinds of polyse- mous bases, the two senses may be processed simultaneously (Williams, 1992). However, metaphors often evolve further, to the point where the metaphoric sense seems to stand on its own, with only a tenuous relation to the literal sense. These are often called frozen metaphors or dead metaphors. The conclusion of this evolutionary pro- cess is the death of metaphors as such (though, Phoenix-like, they often take on new life as literal category senses). Thus, in dead2 metaphors, the base term refers only to the derived abstract sense, which is now taken as a literal meaning; the original spe- ciﬁc sense no longer exists. A good exam- ple is the term blockbuster (as in “Star Wars” was a blockbuster), which roughly means something that has a profound popular effect. This term does not seem metaphoric; in fact, most people are unaware of the original sense of blockbuster, namely, a bomb that can demolish an entire city block. But on the way from conventional metaphor to dead2 metaphor, there is an intriguing intermediate stage, which we call dead1 metaphors. These are similar to con- ventional metaphors in possessing both a lit- eral and a metaphorical meaning, but for dead1 metaphors, the relation between lit- eral and metaphorical has become obscure. For example, temporal prepositions (e.g., AT nine o’clock, ON Monday, IN January) have been analyzed as metaphoric extensions of spatial prepositions (e.g., AT the swimming pool, ON the cruise ship, IN the Paciﬁc Ocean; e.g., Clark, 1973; Traugott, 1978). However, a series of studies by Sandra and Rice (1995) suggests that people often do not recog- nize the semantic relationships between the spatial and temporal uses of prepositions.\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 119 Of course, the fact that people do not read- ily notice the relation does not rule out implicit connections. For example, we use two systems of space–time metaphors – ego-moving (e.g., We are fast approaching the holidays) and time-moving (e.g., Exams are coming closer). Although speakers typically appear unaware of the metaphorical nature of such usages (see McGlone & Harding, 1998), Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002) found a metaphoric consistency effect, indi- cating that these two systems are processed as coherent mappings. Further, Boroditsky (2000) found a priming effect from spa- tial sentences to temporal uses of the same metaphors. This is consistent with Gibbs’s (1980) ﬁnding that dead1 metaphors can be “awakened” to their metaphorical roots in some circumstances. The career of metaphor hypothesis is con- sistent with the idea that metaphor is a pri- mary source of polysemy – metaphors allow words with speciﬁc meanings to take on additional related meanings (e.g., Dirven, 1985; Lee, 1990; Lehrer, 1990; MacCormac, 1985; Miller, 1993; Nunberg, 1979; Sweetser, 1990). Over the career of a metaphor, it can move from having but a single stored (lit- eral) meaning (the novel metaphor stage) to being polysemous (for conventional and dead1 metaphors), and, sometimes, on to again having but a single meaning, namely the derived abstract sense (the dead2 case). Metaphors and Similes Proponents of category-based approaches to metaphor comprehension point out that nominal metaphors have the same grammat- ical form as literal class-inclusion statements, namely, An X is a Y (e.g., Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990; Kennedy, 1990; Shen, 1992). However, nominal metaphors can also be paraphrased as similes – ﬁgurative compar- isons of the form X is like Y – which are grammatically identical to literal comparison statements. Thus, we can say both Time is a river and Time is like a river. What is the cognitive status of metaphor– simile distinction? The dominant view is that similes are simply clearer than metaphors, explicitly inviting a ﬁgurative compari- sion. For example, many theorists have assumed that metaphors are understood as implicit similes (e.g., Kintsch, 1974; Miller, 1979; Ortony, 1979; Tirrell, 1991). Consis- tent with this view, Vosniadou and Ortony (1986) found that children were better able to understand similes than metaphors, as would follow from the idea that similes more directly invite the necessary comparison process. However, Glucksberg and Keysar (1990) have argued the reverse position: that similes are understood as implicit metaphors. This is in keeping with their class-inclusion model of ﬁgurative meaning: Metaphors directly suggest class-inclusions, and similes must be converted to metaphors in order to be processed. We propose an integrative account of the metaphor–simile distinction – namely, gram- matical concordance (Bowdle, 1998; Bowdle & Gentner, 1995, 1999, 2005; Gentner & Bowdle, 2001). A central intuition behind grammatical concordance is that linguistic form tells us something about function. Here we adopt Glucksberg and Keysar’s (1990) insight that metaphors are seen as category statements, but we take the idea a step fur- ther, and argue that linguistic form also tells us something about similes – namely, that they are seen as comparisons. On this view, metaphors and similes invite different comprehension strategies. Because metaphors are grammatically iden- tical to literal class-inclusion statements, they invite categorizing the target as a member of a category named by the base. Likewise, because similes are grammatically identical to literal comparison statements, they invite comparing the target with the literal base concept. The combination of grammatical concordance with the career of metaphor hypothesis leads to a set of predic- tions, and thus offers a valuable route toward testing the career of metaphor hypothesis (Bowdle, 1998; Bowdle & Gentner, 1995, 1999, 2005; Gentner & Bowdle, 2001). Consider ﬁrst the case of novel ﬁgura- tive statements. According to the career of metaphor hypothesis, such statements are\n120 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE interpreted as comparisons between the two literal concepts. Thus, they should most felicitously be phrased as similes. The sim- ile form invites comparison, which accords with the comprehension strategy required. If a novel ﬁgurative is phrased as a metaphor, the hearer is invited to access a stored metaphorical sense which does not in fact exist, so comprehension is initially thwarted. The hearer must then start over using a comparison process – a horizontal alignment with the literal concept evoked by the base. Now consider the case of conventional ﬁgurative statements. According to the career of metaphor hypothesis, such state- ments may be interpreted either as compar- isons or as class-inclusions, as the base term refers simultaneously to a speciﬁc literal con- cept and to an abstract metaphoric category. Thus, either form – simile or metaphor – can be processed directly. For conventional ﬁgurative statements, then, metaphors are interpreted as class-inclusions, whereas sim- iles are interpreted as comparisons. This account generates several testable predictions (see Bowdle, 1998; Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Gentner & Bowdle, 2001). Here, we summarize some ﬁndings on gram- matical form preference and comprehension time. Later, we turn to studies of the conven- tionalization process itself. Grammatical form preferences. If conven- tionalization results in a processing shift from comparison to categorization, then there should be a corresponding shift in people’s preference. People should prefer the comparison (simile) form for novel ﬁg- uratives and the categorization (metaphor) form for conventional ﬁguratives. Therefore, Bowdle and Gentner (2005) gave individuals novel and conventional ﬁguratives and asked which form they preferred for each state- ment. To calibrate the results, we also gave participants literally similar statements (e.g., lemon →orange), for which the compari- son form is most natural, and literal category statements (e.g., robin →bird), for which the categorization form is most natural. As expected, the “X is Y” form was strongly preferred for literal categorizations and the comparison form (“X is like Y”) for literal similarity. More importantly, con- sistent with our predictions, the preference for the metaphor form was far higher for conventional ﬁgurative statements than for novel ﬁgurative statements. Indeed, partic- ipants’ preference for the comparison form was as strong for novel ﬁguratives as it was for literal similarity statements. The conven- tional ﬁguratives were more mixed, consis- tent with the claim that conventional ﬁgu- ratives may be treated either as comparisons or as categorizations. Processing predictions. The career of metaphor hypothesis also makes clear pre- dictions about the effects of conventionality on on-line comprehension. One prediction is that conventional ﬁguratives will be faster to interpret than novel ﬁguratives overall. This is because conventionalization results in storing a metaphorical abstraction; and, as noted earlier, vertical mappings between a target and an abstract category will tend to be computationally less costly than horizontal mappings between two concrete concepts from different domains.8 A more critical prediction concerns the effects of conventionality on the relative comprehension times of metaphors and similes. Because novel ﬁguratives must be interpreted as comparisons, novel similes should be easier to comprehend than novel metaphors. This is because the simile form directly invites comparison, whereas the metaphor form prompts the expectation that an abstract metaphorical category is available – a kind of bait-and-switch, since this expectation will be unfulﬁlled in a novel ﬁgurative. In contrast, conventional ﬁgura- tives should be easier to comprehend as metaphors than as similes. This is because the metaphor form invites categorization – a relatively simple vertical alignment between the target and the abstract metaphoric cat- egory named by the base. Here the simile form, by inviting comparison, invites a more demanding horizontal alignment between the target and the literal base concept. We collected participants’ comprehen- sion times for novel and conventional ﬁgurative statements phrased as either metaphors or similes. The results were\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 121 as predicted. First, conventional ﬁguratives were interpreted faster than novel ﬁgura- tives. And second, there was an interaction between conventionality and grammatical form, such that novel similes were faster than novel metaphors, but conventional metaphors were faster than conventional similes. Naturalistic evidence. There is also indi- rect evidence on the real-life process of conventionalization. First, Zharikov and Gentner (2002) examined the course of development over history for a set of ﬁg- uratives, based on their occurrences in the Oxford English Dictionary. The results showed a frequent pattern of an initial literal meaning, followed over time by ﬁgurative uses with overt comparison marking (such as simile form), followed by metaphorical uses. Table 6.1 shows the example of sanctu- ary, which initially referred to a place of wor- ship and came over time to have a secondary reference to any safe place. As predicted by the career of metaphor account, its initial ﬁgurative uses had overt similarity markings (e.g., She was as safe as in a Sanctuary . . .) with the metaphoric form (e.g., A Sanctuary was opened in his Court . . .) occurring later, presumably as the metaphorical abstraction became conventionalized. Second, a study of natural text by Ron- cero, Kennedy, and Smyth (2006) suggests that (at least for conventional target–base pairs) similes are more likely than metaphors to be accompanied by explanations. Ron- cero et al. searched the Internet for ﬁgu- rative expressions linking concepts such as crime and disease – either as similes (crime is like a disease) or as metaphors (crime is a disease). They found that similes were more likely than metaphors to be accompanied by explanations such as “Crime is like a disease because it spreads by direct personal inﬂu- ence.” They concluded that similes may be preferred when the writer wants to express an out-of-the-ordinary relation between the target and the base. Given that a base has a conventional meaning, if the writer wants to invite going beyond that meaning, a return to the simile form is one way to invite a fresh comparison between base and target.

[First unmarked ﬁgurative meaning] 1700 To form his Party, Histories report, A Sanctuary was opened in his Court, Where glad Offenders safely might resort. Aptness. Some researchers have sug- gested that the simile–metaphor difference is one of aptness rather than of convention- ality (e.g., Chiappe, Kennedy, & Smykowski, 2003; Glucksberg, 2003; Jones & Estes, 2005). Speciﬁcally, it is claimed that the metaphor form is preferred for highly apt ﬁg- uratives and the simile form for less-apt ﬁgu- ratives. This view is consistent with the sense that the metaphor form seems to suggest a stronger relationship between the target and base concepts than the simile form (e.g.,\n122 DEDRE GENTNER AND BRIAN BOWDLE Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990; Kennedy, 1990). Indeed, some studies have found a corre- lation between aptness and conventional- ity (e.g., Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Jones & Estes, 2005). However, there are problems with this line of argument. First, aptness is highly correlated with many other aspects of ﬁg- urative statements, including relationality (Gentner & Clement, 1988), ease of inter- pretation, degree of metaphoricity, imagery, subjective familiarity, and the number of alternative interpretations possible (Katz, Paiio, Marschark, & Clark, 1988), as well as with ease of comprehension (Chiappe, Kennedy, & Chiappe, 2003). Thus, it’s not clear whether aptness itself or one or more of these correlated dimensions is involved here. It’s also not clear how aptness could play a causal role in ﬁgurative language pro- cessing, as it seems to arise as part of the pro- cess of evaluating a metaphor (e.g., Gerrig & Healy, 1983; Gibbs, 1994). Third, the empir- ical ﬁndings are not encouraging.9 For exam- ple, Bowdle & Gentner (2005) found a sig- niﬁcant negative correlation between rated aptness and preference for the metaphor form among novel ﬁgurative statements. That is, the more apt a novel ﬁgurative was, the more strongly the simile form was preferred over the metaphor form. For conventional ﬁguratives, there was no difference in aptness between similes and metaphors. In our view, the likeliest contributor to metaphor preference is relational similarity. There is evidence that relational similarity is a major determinant of aptness (Gent- ner & Clement, 1988) and that it can facilitate online processing (Wolff & Gent- ner, 2000). Indeed, Aisenman (1999) pro- posed that the preference for metaphor form increases with the degree of relational match. Although Aisenman found positive evidence, her study did not control con- ventionality. When Zharikov and Gentner (2002) orthogonally varied both base con- ventionality and the relationality of the ﬁgu- rative’s interpretation10 and elicited partici- pants’ form preferences, the results showed a strong effect of conventionality in determin- ing a preference for metaphor form, and only a marginal main effect of relationality. In a further study, when participants were give the same ﬁgurative statements and asked to rate their agreement with either a rela- tional or an attributional interpretation, they strongly preferred the relational interpreta- tion for both metaphors and similes. Aisenman’s idea that relational similarity contributes to the strength and aptness of a metaphoric mapping seems correct. But the evidence to date suggests that conventional- ity is a far stronger determinant of preference for the metaphoric form. From simile to metaphor – the in vitro conventionalization of novel ﬁguratives. The most dramatic evidence for the career of metaphor hypothesis would be a demon- stration that conventional metaphoric cate- gories can be generated by repeated and con- sistent ﬁgurative comparisons involving the same base term. Therefore, we decided to test this claim directly by seeing whether we could speed up the process of conventional- ization from years to minutes. The idea was to give participants multiple similes with the same base term and parallel meanings, and then test whether this shifted their prefer- ence towards the metaphor form for that base term. There were two phases. The key manip- ulation occurred in the ﬁrst (study) phase, in which participants were given a subset of the later test items. These items were always given in simile form in the study phase. Each subject received one-third of the items in the multiple-similes condition and one-third in the multiple-literal condition; the remain- ing third was not shown during study and served as the control condition. (Item con- dition was counterbalanced over subjects.) In the multiple-similes condition, the key simile (e.g., An obsession is like a tumor) had its base term paired with two new tar- get terms to create new similes (e.g., Doubt is like a tumor, A grudge is like a tumor) with roughly parallel interpretations. In the multiple-literal condition, each base term was paired with new target terms to create two further literal comparisons (e.g., A blis- ter is like a tumor; An ulcer is like a tumor).\nMETAPHOR AS STRUCTURE-MAPPING 123 For both these conditions, these examples were followed by an incomplete statement of the form “– is like a tumor.” Participants were asked to complete it by writing a target term that would make it “similar in meaning to the ﬁrst two.” The second (test) phase, which occurred after a 20-minute ﬁller task, was a grammat- ical form preference test. Participants saw a large set of ﬁguratives (e.g., An obsession is (like) a tumor). This included the ﬁguratives they had seen in the study task, plus other ﬁguratives (both novel and conventional), that they had not seen in the study phase. For each statement, they indicated their prefer- ence for the simile form versus the metaphor form on a sliding scale. The key items were the ﬁguratives used in the study task. Consistent with the career of metaphor account, participants were more likely to prefer the metaphor form (i.e., the categorization form) for items in the multiple-similes condition than for items in the multiple-literal condition, which did not differ from items not seen before. Strik- ingly, seeing/generating a set of novel similes led to a shift toward preferring the metaphor form. (Note that this cannot be explained in terms of a novel-form preference, for there was no such shift in the multiple- literal condition). A further striking point is that the same ﬁguratives were judged in all conditions; thus, the presumed aptness of the match was held constant. Simply by varying the metaphoric conventionality of the base term – by varying participants’ experience aligning parallel ﬁgurative uses, we were able to induce a shift towards the metaphoric form. These results are evidence that aligning parallel ﬁguratives (even in our brief in vitro condition) can give rise to an abstraction that becomes associated with the base; and, fur- ther, that the existence of such an abstraction leads to a preference for the metaphor form. Summary We have suggested that metaphor is like analogy – that the basic processes of anal- ogy are at work in metaphor. Speciﬁcally, we suggest that structural alignment, infer- ence projection, progressive abstraction, and re-representation are employed in the pro- cessing of metaphor and simile. This view can help resolve some tensions in the ﬁeld: for example, on this view, metaphor both reﬂects parallels (Murphy, 1996) and creates new similarities (Lakoff, 1990) between the domain compared, via struc- tural alignment and candidate inferences, respectively. We further propose that individual metaphors evolve over the course of their lives from comparison – horizontal align- ment between literal meanings – in the early stages to categorization – vertical align- ment between the literal target term and the base’s metaphorical abstraction – as they become conventionalized. Convention- alization often results in local metaphoric categories, but it can also take the form of large-scale conventional systems of metaphors. The career of metaphor account offers a uniﬁed theoretical framework for the study of metaphor, analogy, and similarity (see Steen [2007] for an extended discussion of these issues). It renders explicit the process- ing differences between metaphors at differ- ent levels of conventionality and provides a mechanism for the metaphoric generation of polysemous words. Finally, it reconciles the seemingly opposing intuitions behind tradi- tional comparison models and more recent categorization models. Comparison is not inimical to categorization, but rather engen- ders it over time.

However, the basic tenets are accepted by most current models of anal- ogy (e.g., Holyoak & Thagard, 1989; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997; Keane & Brayshaw, 1988; Kokinov & Petrov, 2001; Larkey & Love, 2003; Ramscar & Yarlatt, 2000). 4 Local-to-global is not the same as bottom- up, a point that occasionally engenders confu- sion. In SME, processing starts by identifying matching nodes at any level of the structure, from higher-order relations to concrete per- ceptual attributes. These local identities are then coalesced into global system-mappings (Falkenhainer et al., 1989; Forbus et al., 1995). 5 The attributive category theory can pre- dict a metaphoric slowdown for forward metaphors, such as some suburbs are parasites, by assuming that participants implicitly expe- rience a ﬁt between the target, suburbs, and the metaphorical category associated with parasite, and that this spontaneous catego- rization temporarily overrides their ability to notice that the statement is literally false. But this explanation is highly implausible for a reversed metaphor, such as some parasites are suburbs. Although it might be possible to ﬁnd a category associated with suburb that could apply to parasite, the search for such a match would be laborious and deliberate – hardly likely to spontaneously capture participants’ attention and prevent them from noticing that the statement is literally false. 6 In this condition, participants encountered the terms from the metaphoric base domain in the passage but not the metaphor itself (until the ﬁnal test sentence). If the facili- tation for the consistent condition over the inconsistent condition were due merely to associative priming, the ﬁnal sentence should not differ between the consistent condition and the literal control condition. 7 Note that in both cases, the global metaphors themselves were often familiar conceptual metaphors (e.g., Debate as war); the differ- ence lay in whether the individual metaphors were novel or conventional. 8 Of course, if the two concrete concepts are literally similar to each other, the comparison will be quite fast to process, because there will be many mutually supporting matches at both the relational level and the object- attribute level (see Gentner & Kurtz, 2006, for evidence). 9 One difﬁculty in sorting out the evidence is that some researchers have manipulated the familiarity of the whole ﬁgurative state- ment (that is, the base–target pair; e.g., Blasko & Connine, 1993; Chiappe, Kennedy, & Smykowski, 2003), rather than the conven- tionality of the base term (the focus of the career of metaphor). These two factors are by no means identical, and sorting out the evidence is not straightforward. 10 To vary the ﬁguratives’ interpretations, each ﬁgurative was preceded by a short descrip- tion of the target that focused either on object attributes or on relational structure.

A major claim of this chapter is that there is no sin- gle psychological process for metaphor com- prehension but that the process of compre- hending a metaphor depends on the type of metaphor and varies widely from simple associative mechanisms to elaborate prob- lem solving. Metaphor as a class makes sense linguistically, but it is not meaningful from a computational standpoint to lump together the automatic, immediate comprehension of simple metaphors and the problem solv- ing required to interpret an artful literary metaphor. It has often been recognized that conventional and novel metaphors may be processed in different ways (e.g., Bowdle & Gentner, 2005), but the claim made here goes beyond that: the simplest metaphors are processed in the same way as literal statements, while more complex metaphors require analogical reasoning. Table 7.1 lists four classes of metaphors, without any claim that these provide an exhaustive classiﬁcation or span the full range. The goal is merely to frame the present discussion. There are obvi- ous differences in automaticity between these examples: (a) and (b) are easy and automatic; (c) and (d) require a great deal of deliberate analysis. Of course, once any metaphor has been encountered often enough, its meaning need no longer be com- puted but is simply recalled from memory (Gentner, Bowdle, Wolff, & Boronat, 2001). The focus here is on computation, however. I discuss a model for (a) that simulates the essential aspects of human comprehension for literal sentences as well as metaphors of this kind. I also offer half of a model for (b) but have next to nothing to say about (c) and nothing at all to say about (d). Thus, the computational approach discussed here is still restricted to relatively simple prob- lems. Computational models of psychological processes have several advantages over the- ories stated only verbally. They demon- strate that the postulated processes actually work the way they are said to and allow one to test their implications. However, it is not an easy task to model how metaphors are comprehended because that depends on 129\n130 WALTER KINTSCH Table 7.1: Examples of different types of metaphors Types of metaphors: Examples: (a) Simple metaphors of the form N1-is-N2 My lawyer is a shark My surgeon is a butcher (b) Simple analogy based metaphors She blew up at me She shot down all of my arguments (c) Complex analogy-based metaphors The universe is a computer (d) Literary metaphors We are the eyelids of defeated caves the knowledge the comprehender has that is relevant to the metaphor. In metaphor comprehension, we use our knowledge to create new meaning, new knowledge. Thus, before we can even start modeling compre- hension, we need some way to represent human knowledge, which is a quite non- trivial requirement for there are no exist- ing models of human knowledge that are fully adequate, comprehensive, and objec- tive. There are two ways out of this dilemma. Instead of working with a general model of human knowledge, the theorist can feed the comprehension model whatever knowl- edge is required. Several existing models are discussed that take this approach. These models have made signiﬁcant contributions to our understanding of comprehension, but they are incomplete because they cir- cumvent the question how the knowledge representations relevant to understanding are constructed. Here, I propose to focus instead on the very process of constructing knowledge representations in comprehen- sion, using latent semantic analysis, or LSA, to model human knowledge. LSA is not a fully adequate model of all of human knowl- edge, but it is comprehensive and objective, and it captures enough of how word mean- ings are represented to serve as a useful basis for modeling higher cognitive processes that are strongly knowledge dependent, includ- ing metaphor comprehension. LSA infers meaning relations among words and texts by observing how words are used in a very large number of docu- ments, comprising millions of word tokens (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Landauer, McNamara, Dennis, & Kintsch, 2007). LSA constructs a semantic space that is both a generalization and an abstraction of the input data. It is a generalization because LSA ﬁlls in the gaps in the data, so that it is possible to estimate meaning relation- ships among words and texts that have never been directly observed in the cor- pus. It is an abstraction because LSA dis- cards incidental information and focuses on the essential semantic relations. The method that is used to construct a semantic space is dimension reduction via singular value decomposition, a well-known mathematical technique. A good way to think about a semantic space is as a map of meanings: one can look up in this map the semantic dis- tance between any items, where items may be words or sentences or whole texts. How- ever, the map of meanings is more com- plicated than the familiar two-dimensional maps because about 300 dimensions are needed to adequately represent the seman- tic space. Items are vectors in this space, and their semantic relatedness is given by the cosine of the angle between their vectors. The cosine is a measure like the more famil- iar correlation coefﬁcient, where values close to +1 indicate high levels of similarity, and 0 indicates independence, except that there are no large negative values in the seman- tic space because there are no real seman- tic opposites (antonyms are, in fact, highly related semantically). For example, tree and bark are semantically related with a cosine of .70; tree and trees are almost as highly related, with a cosine of .57 (one tree and many trees are related, but by no means the same), while tree and computer have a cosine of 0. Another concept that is made much use of in the present chapter is that of a semantic neighborhood. The semantic neighborhood of a word consists of the words that have the highest cosine with it in the semantic space. Thus, tree is a close neighbor of bark, the third closest; dog is also a neighbor of bark,\nHOW THE MIND COMPUTES THE MEANING OF METAPHOR 131 but a more distant one, being the 72nd clos- est, reﬂecting the fact that the tree-meaning of the homonym bark dominates the dog- meaning in the corpus on which the LSA space used for these computations is based. However, in the neighborhood of barked (a different word than bark for LSA), dog is the closest neighbor, whereas tree is nowhere to be found. Readers are invited to check these examples or explore their own on the Web site http://lsa.colorado.edu. What does this all have to do with metaphors? According to the model pro- posed here, simple metaphors like My sur- geon is a butcher are understood by modify- ing the vector that represents the meaning of surgeon in LSA in such a way that those parts that are related to butcher become emphasized and unrelated parts are de- emphasized, that is, by creating a contextu- alized vector that represents surgeon-who-is- a-butcher. The same process underlies literal comprehension: to understand My surgeon is skillful, a surgeon-who-is-skillful vector is cre- ated in much the same way. Word Senses, Literal and Metaphorical A caricature of the way most cognitive scien- tists currently conceive of how the meaning of words is represented in the mind might go something like this. There exists a mental lexicon that is a bit like a real lexicon in that it lists all the literal meanings and senses of all the words. There are signiﬁcant contro- versies about various aspects of this general scheme, such as how to retrieve the right sense at the right time, or about the role of perceptual information or embodiment, but the general scheme of listing senses and meanings is widely accepted. LSA suggests a completely different approach, discarding the whole concept of a mental lexicon. What LSA does is to infer a context-free seman- tic representation for the meaning of each word – a vector in the semantic space. Thus, the homonym bark (which can refer to the sound dogs make, the surface of tree trunks, or a certain type of sailing ship) is repre- sented by a single vector that mixes up the dog- and tree-, and ship- meanings of bark; similarly, in LSA, there is a single vector for the verb give, which has 44 senses in WordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/). Nevertheless, when these ambiguous vec- tors are used in context, sensible results are obtained. Thus, bark is strongly related to both tree (cos = .70) and dog (cos = .34), but dog and tree are not related (cos = .06). However, people are aware of the different meanings of bark and the many senses of give, and if LSA is to mimic how people perceive meaning, it too must be capable of contex- tualizing the meaning of a word. The predication model of Kintsch (2001) is an algorithm that allows word senses and meanings to emerge when an LSA vector is used in context. Thus, instead of a list of different meanings in a mental lexicon, a contextual meaning is generated from the context-free LSA vector every time a word is used. The word vector is subtly, or not so subtly, modiﬁed by the context it appears in. What a word means in this model is always different, depending on the context of its use. Word senses are not ﬁxed but are emergent. There is no mental lexicon; instead, meaning is always generated anew from two components: the context-free vec- tor that represents a word in the LSA space and the context in which the word is used. In the construction-integration model of Kintsch (1998), discourse representations are built up through a spreading activation process in a network deﬁned by the con- cepts and propositions in a text. Predica- tion works the same way: a network is con- structed containing the word to be modiﬁed and its semantic neighborhood and linked to the context; spreading activation in that network ensures that those elements of the neighborhood most strongly related to the context become activated and are able to modify the original word vector. Figure 7.1 shows how the meaning of bark is generated in the context of dog and in the context of tree. In the actual model, the semantic neigh- borhood of bark would be much larger; for simplicity, only three neighbors of bark are shown in Figure 7.1, linked to both bark and\n132 WALTER KINTSCH bar k lumber k ennel dog canoes .39 .38 .02 .04 .66 .34 Figure 7.1. Spreading activation networks for the generation of the contextual meaning of bark in the context of dog and tree. Only three items from the neighborhood of bark are included. The link strengths of positive links (plain lines) are the cosines between words; the total strengths of negative links (dashed lines) are chosen to equal the sum of the positive links. the context word (either dog or tree) by their cosine values. The three neighbors them- selves inhibit each other in such a way that the total positive and negative link strength balance. As a result of spreading activation in these networks, words in the semantic neighborhood of bark that are related to the context become activated, and words that are unrelated become deactivated. Thus, in the context of dog, the activation of kennel becomes 1 and the activation of the other two words becomes 0; in the context of tree, the activation values for lumber, kennel, and canoes become 1, 0, and .02, respectively. The contextual meaning of barkdog is then the centroid of the bark and kennel vectors; that of barktree is the (weighted) centroid of bark, lumber, and canoes. Barkdog becomes more dog-like and less tree-like; the opposite happens for barktree. If we had considered more than just three neighbors and selected a larger set of context-relevant neighbors to modify the bark vector two distinct mean- ings of bark would have emerged: selecting the six most highly activated neighbors to modify bark from a neighborhood of 500, the cosine between barktree and barkdog is only .03. Furthermore, barkdog is no longer related to tree, cos = –.04, and barktree is no longer related to dog, cos = .02. The effect of predication on homonyms that have unrelated meanings is quite dra- matic. That is not always the case. Words have different senses. In the present view, they have inﬁnitely many senses, a new one in every context the word is used, but these senses need not differ much from each other. For instance, if the adjective long is used in the context of time, its vector is hardly mod- iﬁed at all, for time selects neighbors of long that are already very close to it (and hence have little effect when combined with the original vector); when long is used in the context yard, its meaning is changed a lit- tle more because slightly different neighbors are emphasized in the context of yard than in the context of time; however, when we talk about a long story, the sense of long is noticeably different than in a yard long: it moves away from measure and distance and comes closer to book and read (for more detail, see Kintsch, in press). Similarly, the house vector in the context of yard is not much modiﬁed, but the context House of Representatives quite changes the house vec- tor, de-emphasizing the house–yard relation and moving it closer to Congress and Senate. In general, one can say that when words are used in the way they are normally used, con- text will have little effect on their meaning because high-frequency contexts are already well reﬂected by their LSA vector. How- ever, if a word is used in an unexpected way, context affects its meaning a great deal,\nHOW THE MIND COMPUTES THE MEANING OF METAPHOR 133 modifying its vector to reﬂect the unusual (or less usual) context. The model of a generative lexicon sketched here (also Kintsch, 2001, 2007) sidesteps many of the problems encountered by the conventional view of the mental lexi- con. (Klein & Murphy, 2001, although adopt- ing that view, provide an excellent discussion of the serious difﬁculties faced by models of the mental lexicon). But the mental lexicon is not the primary concern of this chapter; the point here is, rather, that metaphor com- prehension comes for free with the predica- tion model. More speciﬁcally, the compre- hension of metaphors of type (a) in Table 7.1 may involve no more than the same sort of sense generation that is needed every time a word is employed when it is used literally. Literal comprehension and metaphor com- prehension, at least for the simplest kind of metaphors, involve the same psychological process, except that there is more of it in the metaphor case. Predication often does not do much when words are used in their canon- ical sense; when they are used metaphori- cally, the effects of predication are always pronounced, in contrast. The Predication Model for Simple Metaphors Three lines of argumentation will be used here to evaluate the claim that (simple) metaphors and literal comprehension are the same in terms of the psychological pro- cesses involved. First, it will be shown that the predication algorithm yields intuitively sensible interpretations of metaphors. Sec- ond, the algorithm will be used to simu- late some experimental results from the psy- cholinguistic literature. Finally, an attempt will be made to situate the present model in the context of the literature on metaphor and metaphor comprehension. To show that predication generates sen- sible interpretations of metaphors is not a very strong argument, but it is a necessary precondition. Predication generates a vector, that is, a list of 300 numbers that by itself is totally uninterpretable. Kintsch (2000, 2001) demonstrated that this vector moves in the direction it is supposed to when com- pared with intuitively compelling seman- tic landmarks. Thus, shark alone is strongly related to swim and ﬁns and only moder- ately related to viciousness and bloodthirsty; however, the sharklawyer that is generated from My lawyer is a shark is less related to the ﬁsh and more strongly to viciousness and bloodthirsty. Thus, what we say about lawyer is not that he is a ﬁsh (though resid- ual ﬁsh-meanings are still there, too!) but that he is vicious and dangerous. Consider the reversible metaphor My surgeon is a butcher – My butcher is a surgeon with respect to the landmarks scalpel and axe. Surgeon is related to scalpel, cos = .29, but not to axe, cos = .05. Butcher is related to axe, cos = .37, but not to scalpel, cos = .01. Surgeon in the butcher context, however, is more strongly related to axe, cos = .42, than to scalpel, cos = .10. Conversely, butcher in the surgeon context has a cos = .25 with scalpel and cos = .26 with axe. According to this model, not even a surgeon-like butcher quite sheds his image. A somewhat stronger test of the model involves its ability to simulate experimen- tal results reported in the literature on metaphor comprehension. Kintsch (2000) has shown that the model can account for the qualitative results of two priming stud- ies. In the ﬁrst of these studies, by Glucks- berg, McGlone, and Manfredi (1997), the time readers took to comprehend metaphors was measured as well as the interpretation that they generated. The metaphors were presented in two experimental conditions, with a literal prime and alone. For instance, if the metaphor to be comprehended was My lawyer is a shark, the literal prime would be Sharks can swim. Glucksberg et al. found that readers interpreted the metaphors as intended in both conditions, but that they took signiﬁcantly longer when literal primes preceded them. Simulations with the pred- ication model yield just this pattern: the ﬁnal outcome is the same in the model, with and without prime, but a literal prime activates all the literal links in the seman- tic neighborhood and it takes several cycles\n134 WALTER KINTSCH of spreading activation before that activation is overcome and the appropriate metaphori- cal links begin to dominate. Without the lit- eral prime, the metaphorical links are strong from the very beginning. The ﬁnal state is the same, however, with and without a prime: the model settles on the intended metaphor- ical interpretation. Another experiment that was simulated in Kintsch (2000) is just the reverse of the study just described: at issue is the compre- hension of a simple literal statement (such as Sharks are good swimmers), with either a literal prime (The hammerhead is a shark) or a metaphorical prime (My lawyer is a shark). Gernsbacher and Keysar (1995) have shown that people have no problem verify- ing the target statement in either case, but the metaphorical prime slows them down. In the model, the literal prime activates all the right links in the semantic neighborhood, so that they have an advantage when the target statement is presented for veriﬁcation; the metaphorical prime, however, gives an initial advantage to all the wrong links when the lit- eral target has to be veriﬁed; it takes several cycles of a spreading activation to overcome that advantage, but overcome it will be, as both people and the model understand the target statement correctly. Kintsch and Bowles (2002) have used the predication model to explore the differences between easy to understand and difﬁcult to understand metaphors. Subjects rated a large number of metaphors of the form N1 is N2 for ease of comprehension on a scale of 1 to 5. For instance, The mosquito is a vampire was rated easy (1.29), while Happiness is a ditch was rated difﬁcult (4.20). Subjects also com- pleted sentence frames of the form N1 is – with what they thought each metaphor was supposed to mean. For example, in response to Some jobs are jails, the 30 subjects gave the following responses: conﬁning (six times), dead ends (twice), hell (twice), pris- ons with no escape (twice), and 18 answers given only by one person, such as endless and hard to get out of. The average cosine between pairs of responses in this set is .37. Easy and difﬁcult metaphors differed greatly in the responses they elicited. First, almost half of the subjects gave the same response (or paraphrases) when the inter- pretation was easy, versus only 21% for dif- ﬁcult metaphors. For difﬁcult metaphors, subjects often did not come up with a response at all, which never happened for easy metaphors. Also, responses were more coherent for easy metaphors (the average cosine among responses was .64) than for difﬁcult metaphors (cos = .55). All of these differences were statistically signiﬁ- cant. What is surprising here is not that sub- jects are more consistent when they inter- pret easy metaphors, but how consistent their responses still are even to metaphors whose interpretation is far from obvious. The model simulations help us to under- stand why. The ﬁrst question Kintsch and Bowles asked was whether the model generates interpretations of metaphors that are like the ones people generate. To answer this question, the cosine was computed between the metaphor vector the model generated (i.e., the centroid of N1, N2, and four of its neighbors that are most strongly related to N1) and the total set of responses pro- duced by the subjects. This cosine turned out to be cos = .51 on the average, which is a sizeable value, hugely above the cosine between the metaphor vector and a ran- dom set of words of equal size. Interestingly, this value was the same for easy and difﬁ- cult metaphors. In one case, there are a few strong responses given by most subjects; in the other, there is a more widely distributed response set, but the model accounts for both. Closer inspection of what the model does may help us understand what peo- ple do. For easy metaphors, such as Hap- piness is gold, the model does not have to look far among the close neighbors of gold to ﬁnd ones that are related to happiness; for instance, precious is a very close neigh- bor of gold with a cosine of .67, and it is also strongly related to happiness, cos = .30. Thus, the model will zero in on a few strong responses, as people do. One might think that with difﬁcult metaphors what happens is that the model has to search for neighbors much farther down the list to ﬁnd something\nHOW THE MIND COMPUTES THE MEANING OF METAPHOR 135 appropriate. Thus, for Happiness is a ditch, anything happiness-related in the neighbor- hood of ditch is very far away from ditch. But at that point, the spreading activation process does not activate that item strongly enough because the cosine with ditch is too low. Thus, no strongly activated item related to both words is found, and the most strongly activated words happen to be spurious items that are related only to one or the other of the words in the metaphor, not both. Thus, for Happiness is a ditch, whatever common- ality there is in the subjects responses are either words related to ditch only (deep) or words related to happiness only (precious) – subjects respond with something, and the model computes something, but in either case, it is not really an interpretation of the metaphor but a stopgap. Kintsch and Bowles (2002) conclude, albeit tentatively, that the predication model can predict the aptness of a metaphor: if the model ﬁnds a close neighbor of the predi- cate that is at all related to the argument, readers will consider it an apt metaphor, much as envisaged in the salience imbalance theory of Ortony (1979). However, gener- ating a metaphorical meaning is not a mat- ter of feature transfer: the neighbors that are selected by the predication model to create a metaphorical interpretation of a word do not simply become attributes of that word but rather, by being merged into the word vec- tor, change its relation to the whole seman- tic space, with possibly wide-ranging effects throughout that space. Many questions about metaphor com- prehension remain to be answered, how- ever. If literal statements and metaphors are processed the same way, how is it pos- sible that people have no trouble saying that My lawyer is a shark is a metaphor and Sharks can swim is not? Of course, human judgment is not always as reliable – it may take some convincing before the lin- guistically untrained undergraduate accepts that The stock market went down involves a metaphor, but in general, there is a real dis- tinction there. An explanation may involve the notion of embodiment: for literal state- ments, the nonverbal representation maps directly into the verbal one, whereas this may not be the case for metaphorical state- ments. Another distinction that needs to be made is that between metaphors and simi- les (e.g., Glucksberg, 2001). The predication model creates contextualized representa- tions in the same way for both. It may be the case, however, that the linguistic cues is-a versus like are instructions to treat these rep- resentations differently: for an is-a metaphor to be apt, all that is required is that there are one or a few links between the near neigh- borhood of the predicate and the argument; the like in a simile, however, requires that most or at least many of the neighbors of the predicate are appropriate for the argu- ment. Thus, He eats like a pig implies that his eating was like that of a pig in most respects, while He is a pig may say something about his behavior, character, even appear- ance, without disputing the obvious differ- ence in many other respects between man and pig. However, these questions deserve more systematic research before these spec- ulations can be considered as more than tentative. The most important claim made by the present model is that literal and metaphoric comprehension are the same. Historically, a sharp distinction has been made between literal and ﬁgurative language. Metaphor was considered a way to express literal semantics indirectly: if a statement does not make sense literally, it must be reinter- preted metaphorically (e.g., Searle, 1979). A series of psychological experiments in the 1970s and 1980s has provided conclusive evidence against this sequential view, how- ever (for a review, see Gibbs, 1994). Cur- rently, two classes of theories of metaphor dominate the discussion in cognitive sci- ence and compete with each other. Literal and ﬁgurative comprehension are thought to involve either parallel processes or are con- sidered essentially the same. According to Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Gibbs (1994) metaphor comprehension occurs in paral- lel with literal comprehension, but it is spe- cial because metaphors are understood with reference to a set of conceptual metaphors, which are organizing principles in long-term\n136 WALTER KINTSCH memory. According to Glucksberg and his collaborators (for a review, see Glucksberg, 1998), metaphor and literal comprehension are the same: metaphors are understood not by accessing conceptual metaphors from long-term memory but by creating an ad hoc category in working memory. The present model is closely related to Glucksberg’s class-inclusion model. The main difference is that it spells out exactly how that new category is generated in context. But the predication model is not nec- essarily in conﬂict with the Lakoff–Gibbs approach either. Predication works by select- ing context appropriate information from the semantic neighborhood of words, which contains information about the conceptual schemata that are claimed to be essential for metaphor comprehension. Thus, the neigh- borhood of love must contain items relevant to the various love-schemata, such as love is a journey, love is insanity, love is a bat- tle, and so on. A particular metaphor about love would pick out items relevant to one of these schemata to construct a unique and novel concept in working memory, thereby creating a new class in the Glucksberg sense, or accessing a Lakofﬁan knowledge schema. The difference between a literal statement like Love is an emotion and a metaphor like Love is madness might simply be that a different body of knowledge becomes rel- evant – what we know about emotions in one case, and what we have learned about how people behave when they are in love. One might argue, then, about whether human knowledge is indeed organized in terms of metaphorical knowledge schemata as posited by Lakoff, but the difference between parallel and same processing of metaphors disappears in the present model. Thus, expressing a theory in computational terms, in this case, does not help us to dis- tinguish between alternatives, but questions whether these theories are in fact alterna- tives as far as processing is concerned. In the present framework, literal and metaphorical statements are processed the same way but might very well depend on distinct bodies of knowledge. Metaphor and Analogy So far, we have restricted ourselves to metaphors of type (a) in Table 7.1, simple N1-is-N2 constructions. Metaphors of type (b) are considerably more complicated from a processing standpoint because of a shift in emphasis from semantic content to seman- tic relations. It no longer sufﬁces to look at how the meaning of a word, its seman- tic content, is modiﬁed when it is used metaphorically, but what matters is the semantic relationship between words. To understand She blew up at me, it is not suf- ﬁcient to let she select the items it likes out of the neighborhood of blew up; under- standing requires a deeper analysis in this case. Many authors (e.g., Gentner & Mark- man, 1997; Gentner et al., 2001; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) have pointed out that such metaphors are based on an underlying anal- ogy, and that understanding requires that the unexpressed implied elements of that analogy must in some way be reconstructed. To understand what she did, we must note that she corresponds to some object that can blow-up – a kettle, a bomb, or even a vol- cano, whatever happens to be most salient in one’s personal experience – and that blow- up corresponds to something like become- angry. The analogy problem that needs to be solved in this case is (volcano) : blow-up : she : (become-angry). Volcano and become- angry are enclosed with brackets, because the whole point of a metaphor is that these can be left vague and underspeciﬁed; it is some container that blows up, and she acts in a violent and destructive manner. What is important is that the relation between vol- cano : blow-up and person : become-angry is preserved. In LSA terms, we generate a vec- tor in the semantic space that is related to “person” in the same way that blow-up is related to “volcano” – naming it become-angry is only for our convenience and a little mis- leading, for the whole point is that we have created a vector in the semantic space that does not correspond to an existing literal expression in our language, thereby extend- ing the expressivity of language.\nHOW THE MIND COMPUTES THE MEANING OF METAPHOR 137 Table 7.2: Sample analogy problems (after Mangalath, Quesada, & Kintsch, 2004) scissors : cut diversion : boredom knife : cut clamp : sharpen pen : write chair : sing assurance : uncertainty enmity : hatred secrecy : curiosity reward : deed sluggishness : fatigue A complete computational model of how people understand metaphors like She blew up at me does not yet exist. However, to understand such metaphors, an underlying analogy problem must be solved, and the predication model has been extended to solving analogy problems. A set of 374 analogy problems from old versions of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) collected by Turney and Littman (2005) was used as a test bed. These prob- lems are all of the same form as the exam- ples shown in Table 7.2, with answers to be selected from a set of multiple-choice alter- natives. Intuitively, people solve these prob- lems by considering the meaning of each of the word pairs to determine the nature of the semantic relations that exist between the words. Are they related as an instance to a class, or a part to a whole, or as oppo- sites – or in some other way? If one or more prominent semantic relations are detected between the words of the source pair, peo- ple analyze the relations between the words in the target pairs and look for the alternative that most closely matches the source pair in terms of the semantic relationship between the words. In the case of the scissors : cut exam- ple, the most obvious semantic relation that links these two words is “is-used-to” which matches the relation in two of the target pairs, (a) knife : cut as well as (c) pen : write. These are said to be the structurally related target pairs, and both would be cor- rect answers in an analogy test. Alternative (b) is semantically similar to the source pair but is not structurally related because clamps are not used to sharpen. Mangalath, Quesada, and Kintsch (2004) have proposed a model of analogical prob- lem solving that mimics the way people solve such problems. First, the meaning of the source words is contextually elaborated. This is done with the predication algorithm in exactly the same way as for metaphors. Speciﬁcally, the contextualized meaning of each word in the context of the other is gen- erated, yielding a vector composed of the two words themselves and whatever seman- tic neighbors are most relevant to each in the context of the other. Second, this vec- tor representing the contextualized meaning of a word pair is compared with a number of prominent semantic relations that have been identiﬁed in the linguistic literature, speciﬁcally, 10 between-word relations that have been identiﬁed in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). Each relation is characterized for this purpose by a set of words commonly used to express this relation. Table 7.3 shows the semantic relations and their corresponding words that have been employed in the anal- yses reported by Mangalath et al. The cosines between the scissors-cut vec- tor and hyponymy or antonymy words, for example, will be relatively low (kind-of or opposite-of do not ﬁt in well with scissors- cut), whereas the cosines between the use and entailment words will be higher (scissors have the purpose of cutting, cut may imply scissors, etc.). To determine which multiple- choice alternative is most like the source pair in terms of semantic relations, the model computes the correlation between the cosines of the source pair and the 10 rela- tions and the cosines of each alternative pair and the 10 relations. In the present example, these correlations are r = .99 for knife-cut (i.e., the semantic relations between scissors- cut and knife cut are identical), and r = .86 for pen-write, also very high. The semanti- cally similar (scissors and clamp are related, as are cut and sharpen) but structurally unre- lated (clamps are not used to sharpen) dis- tracter clamp-sharpen correlates less highly than the semantically dissimilar but struc- turally related pen-write, r = .79. The unrelated alternative chair-sing, does not\n138 WALTER KINTSCH Table 7.3: Ten semantic relations and the words used to express these relations (after Mangalath, Quesada, & Kintsch, 2004) (i).

Antonymy – X is the opposite of Y (Find:Hide) {opposite, unlike, different, antithesis, opposed, contradiction, contrast, reverse, anti, not the same as, antonym} (vii).

Figure 7.2 shows the pattern of results obtained for the second example shown in Table 7.2. The pattern of cosines between the source pair boredom- diversion and the semantic relations corre- lates most highly with the correct choice assurance-uncertainty, r = .96. The two alternatives that share some relational simi- larity with the correct choice, enmity-hatred and secrecy-curiosity, yield high correlations, r = .55 and r = .61, respectively. The alter- natives that are clearly different structurally yielded low correlations, r = .29 for reward- deed, and r = .15 for sluggishness-fatigue. The Mangalath et al. model was evaluated against the whole set of 374 analogy prob- lems from old SAT tests collected by Turney and Littman (2005). The model chose the correct response on 48% of the problems and erred on 34%. For the remaining 18%, the model failed to produce an answer because one or more words in the problem did not appear in the corpus on which LSA was based. That corpus was the General Read- ing Space (available at lsa.colorado.edu) that estimates the total reading material that a typical high school graduate might have read, amounting to about 11 million words. Thus, the model’s performance should be compared to the performance of students taking the SAT, not to highly educated people who would get most of these SAT problems correct. In fact, Mangalath et al. estimated that their model performed at a level corresponding to the 41st percentile of college-bound seniors. They also reported an experiment in which the solution rates of college freshmen for various analogy prob- lems were compared with each other and the model. The model’s solution rates on different problems were just as similar to that of the college freshman as one student to another. Thus, the model’s performance does not appear to be discernibly different from that of the students who might be expected to take the SAT. Turney and Littman (2005) achieve a comparable performance rate, with 47% cor- rect solutions, which improved to 56% in a newer version of their model (Turney, 2004).

There are other psychological models of analogy making and several well-developed theo- ries. The present model is quite compati- ble with the theoretical thinking on analogy (e.g., Gentner, 1983; Holyoak & Thagard, 1989). Its main contribution is that it is a computational model that, unlike other computational models, builds its own prob- lem representation in an automatic way and does not have to rely on hand-coded repre- sentations. There are computational models that can handle more difﬁcult analogy prob- lems (French, 2002, provides a review), but they bypass the crucial initial step of gen- erating the knowledge representation for a problem. The model of analogy so far developed is a building block for a complete computa- tional model of metaphor understanding for metaphors of type (b) in Table 7.1. What is missing is a component that generates the terms for the analogy from memory. The existing model demonstrates, however, that a system based on associative knowledge like LSA can be extended to model analytical reasoning and hence may someday be capa- ble of modeling comprehension for more complex metaphors. Metaphors as Expressions of Similarity, Category Membership, and Analogies At various points in this chapter, com- parisons were made between the present model and the rich psycholinguistic litera- ture on metaphor. A recent paper by Bowdle and Gentner (2005) provides a convenient framework to make these comparisons more systematic, thus placing the present model more precisely within the existing literature. Bowdle and Gentner (2005) have com- pared and contrasted three different views of metaphoric mapping: the classical theory that metaphors express similarities (of which Aristotle and Ortony, 1979, are representative); the view of Glucksberg and others that metaphors express category memberships (e.g., Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990); and their own model, which regards metaphors as analogies. They discuss a num- ber of problems of the ﬁrst two approaches. Since the present model is clearly related to both of these approaches, it is\n140 WALTER KINTSCH instructive to see how it fares with respect to these criticisms. Bowdle & Gentner ﬁnd four problems with similarity models. 1. Similarity models beg the question, which properties are selected for the comparison. Thus, in Dew is a veil, there are numerous properties of dew and veil (e.g., silent) that are irrelevant to the meaning of the metaphor. The present model never selects properties but adds word vectors. Since both dew and veil are related to silent in more or less the same way, their vector sum will have the same relation to silent as either term alone. Hence, irrelevant properties are not (or only minimally) affected by the predi- cation algorithm. 2. Similarity models have problems with the asymmetry of metaphors. The predication procedure is essentially asymmetric. 3. Features can mean something different in different contexts, for example, both men and wolves are predatory, but what that means is quite different. In the predication model, when predatory is predicated about wolves its vector rep- resentation is different than when it is predicated about men. 4. Metaphors may transfer whole knowl- edge systems from one domain to another, as in The mind is a computer, or the example shown in Table 7.1 (c). This is a criticism of the present model, too, which has not been extended to com- plex system analogies. 5. Thus, the ﬁrst three criticisms that Bow- dle and Gentner have about similarity- based models of metaphor are no prob- lem for the present model. They also make two criticisms of the category- based models. 6. It is not clear how category member- ship models arrive at the appropriate category. In their example, A child is a snowﬂake elicits the category unique- ness, while Youth is a snowﬂake requires the category transience. In the present model, all categories are constructed interactively from topic and vehicle as the metaphor is comprehended, so no preexisting categories have to be selected (as in the interactive property attribution model of Glucksberg et al., 1997). 7. Bowdle and Gentner object to the com- putational complexity of category-based models because it would “place unrea- sonable demands on a hearer’s men- tal capacity” (p. 195). As the present model shows, that is not necessarily a problem: the predication algorithm is a simple spreading activation process in an already established semantic network, no more complex than many existing models of human performance. Spread- ing activation is presumably a parallel process in the brain and makes only small demands on its resources. The model proposed here combines aspects of similarity comparisons and cat- egory classiﬁcation, but it does not suffer from most of the limitations that Bowdle and Gentner noted for these types of models. Furthermore, it includes an analogy compo- nent. It is, however, limited to rather simple forms of metaphor and analogy. In its present form, it cannot deal with complex, system- based analogies that are central to some of the most interesting types of metaphor. The Creativity of Language Metaphor researchers typically are not sat- isﬁed with studying comprehension in the laboratory under controlled and hence unnatural conditions, or with computer sim- ulations of simple examples. The work reported here has been restricted to a limited range of metaphors – type (a) in Table 7.1, with a partial exploration of type (b). Both of these are simple metaphors whose com- prehension is typically automatic and effort- less. Indeed, one might complain that nei- ther really involves what makes metaphors so interesting for most people – the cre- ative aspect of cognition. Suppose we grant that people really understand simple, con- ventional metaphors in the manner sketched\nHOW THE MIND COMPUTES THE MEANING OF METAPHOR 141 here. Some researchers who believe that metaphor is essential to creative thought might not ﬁnd this work relevant to their concerns. That would be a mistake, however, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the creativity of language. What this chapter demonstrates is that human thought is cre- ative even in its simplest forms, that mean- ings are never ﬁxed, to be picked out ready- made from the right drawer when needed but are emergent, to be generated in the con- text of use. This is true for literal word senses as well as for metaphor, where the con- textual effects are particularly noticeable. Creative thought is found not only in deep, literary metaphors or complex, scientiﬁc analogies but is pervasive in language, even if we can only model it explicitly in its simplest forms. It has often been argued that metaphor represents an extension of the range of what language can express. People are simply unwilling to be silent about what they can- not talk about – they use metaphor instead. However, metaphor and literal comprehen- sion are still considered by most authors to be different processes. The present work suggests that, while they clearly differ in linguistic analysis, in terms of psychological processes their underlying continuity should be emphasized. The kind of computational model pre- sented here is at present unable to cope with complex metaphors. Type (c) is well beyond its scope. To understand such metaphors, we need to compute not merely a single anal- ogy as in the previous examples. Instead, a whole analogical structure must be gen- erated that may have many different cor- respondences and alignments.1 There are models of analogy making that can deal with complex structures, for example, like mapping the solar system into atomic struc- ture. Such models (e.g., Forbus, Gentner, & Law, 1995; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997) can perform more complex mappings than the present model. However, because they rely on hand-coded propositional knowl- edge representations, they circumvent an essential component of the comprehension process, the construction of the problem- relevant knowledge representation, which is the focus of the present approach. Writers have often reported that the very act of writing down an idea helped them to clarify it. Ideas in the head sometimes appear brilliant, only to be unmasked as unformed and incoherent when we try to put them down on paper. The virtue of computational modeling is much like that of writing down our thoughts: it forces us to think through a problem and face its implications. This chapter demonstrates how this approach, which has been successful in many areas of research, can also be effective in the study of metaphor. Note 1 Furthermore, this example (The universe is a computer) is an empty metaphor for most of us because understanding it requires a great deal of technical knowledge about quantum mechanics that we don’t have.

Rachel Giora Introduction Is metaphor unique as assumed by Aristotle (350 BCE-a, b) and more recently by Grice (1975) and Searle (1979)? Is metaphor more creative than literal language? Are the pro- cesses involved in making sense of nonlit- eral language different from those involved in interpreting literal utterances? The fol- lowing literal pun (1) and the (originally Hebrew) metaphors in (2) and (3) (in ital- ics for convenience) might help illustrate these questions. The ﬁrst example appeared in Haaretz in English; the second exam- ple appeared in an editorial of the far-left Israeli magazine Etgar; the third example projects the attitude of a rightwing Israeli journalist toward the prospective Road Map Agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis: (1) Till barriers do them part Together, the separation fence, the Law of Citizenship, and the curfew are break- ing down and restructuring marriages in Arab society. (Ettinger, 2004) (2) The anti globalization movement . . . refused to point an accusing ﬁnger at the political address responsible for the economic chaos – the White House and its satellites. Bin Laden made concrete, even if lunatic, the insubstantial slogan of the [anti globalization] movement. (“Smash Capitalism,” 2003, p. 3) (3) Yeah, during two years they [the Palestinians] are to pay lip service {Hebrew: ‘lip tax’} to democracy. But they are not required to pay hard cash – to truly and sincerely accept the exis- tence of a Jewish state. (Shavit, 2003) The ﬁrst example is a literal pun. It gives rise to two literal meanings: a novel one, which is made explicit (Till barriers do them part) and a salient one, which is evoked by the explicit and which is associated with the marriage vows (Till death do us part). The interplay between these two meanings, allowed by the activation and retention of both, makes up the message of the utter- ance. It alludes to the damage inﬂicted on Palestinian families by the Israeli brutal occupation. The second example seems 143\n144 RACHEL GIORA to invite activation and retention of the salient, nonliteral sense of a conventional metaphor – the anticapitalism sense of Smash Capitalism – alongside its less salient, somewhat literal meaning which evokes the sense of real smashing of some of the sym- bols of capitalism (on meaning salience, see Giora, 1997, 2003; see also section on “Mod- els of Metaphor Processing,” this chapter). The third example features a (Hebrew) con- ventional idiomatic phrase – pay lip service – which is suggestive of an apparent, insin- cere commitment. In addition, it features a novel metaphor – pay hard cash – which, in the given context, is an extension of both the literal and nonliteral senses of the previ- ous idiom, alluding to the opposite of that idiom, that is, to some substantial, binding commitment. Do we engage in different processes, then, when trying to make sense of such literal and nonliteral uses? Admittedly, in all the examples, the salient sense of the expres- sions cannot escape our mind even when apparently inappropriate: The novel literal use of Till barriers do them part activates the salient literal vow Till death do us part. The novel literal use of Smash Capitalism allows an insight into the salient nonliteral sense of the metaphor – the anticapitalism protest – on top of the novel literal interpretation of the collocation alluding to the physical destruction of trade center buildings, which is now brought to the fore (see also Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004). Similarly, the novel metaphor in (3) – pay hard cash – draws on the conventionalized nonliteral use of pay lip service intending, however, to get across its opposite – a binding com- mitment, while echoing the literal monetary sense. The third example is particularly inter- esting because it also resonates1 with metaphors, appearing earlier in the text (see 4). These also include a negative metaphor (does not include such an obvious barter) whose salient literal meaning derives from the same semantic ﬁeld (of ﬁnancial or monetary exchanges) as the metaphors that follow it: (4) The road map does not include such an obvious barter. Instead it goes back to the old mistake of giving a huge credit to a suspicious loaner. It gets back to the belying medicine of postponing the pay day. (Shavit, 2003) Such extensions (as seen in both 3 and 4) suggest that the literal meaning of the negated metaphor has been activated (via intra-lexical priming; see Fodor, 1983, p. 81) and has not been suppressed automatically even in the presence of a contextual cue to the contrary. Instead, it has been retained for future purposes. Thus, even when a local contextual cue such as negation alerts the comprehender to the contrary, suppression is kept on hold until late context either invites it or not (see, Giora, Fein, Aschke- nazi, & Alkabets-Zlozover, 2007). These literal and metaphoric examples help shed light on an enduring question in the pragmatics and psycholinguistics of metaphor. They suggest that, contra the tra- ditional view, which assumes the unique- ness of metaphor (Grice, 1975; Searle, 1979), metaphors and literals need not differ but instead may involve similar processes and products. In what follows, I will adduce evi- dence that argues against the uniqueness hypothesis. Apparently, some of the issues to be dis- cussed here belong in the early stages of comprehension, disclosing early processes, while others belong in the later interpreta- tion processes, disclosing utterance products (on the time course of metaphor interpreta- tion involving early processes and late prod- ucts, see Gibbs, 1993, 1994, pp. 115–119; see also section on “Models of Metaphor Pro- cessing”). Early stages pertain to bottom-up, automatic, and stimulus-driven processes such as lexical access; later processes per- tain to the products of these processes, which involve top-down procedures such as inferencing, loosening or narrowing of ini- tial outputs, and suppression or even reten- tion of inappropriate outputs. The various models of ﬁgurative language have different assumptions and predictions concerning the\nIS METAPHOR UNIQUE? 145 time course of metaphor understanding in as far as early processes and late products are concerned. Models of Metaphor Processing Metaphor theories can be viewed as either advocating the supremacy of context effects or subscribing to the priority of lexical effects. Though they all acknowledge the effects of context on the products of meta- phor, they disagree as to the size of the effect and its time course. The various assumptions have different implications with regard to the issue of metaphor uniqueness. On the Temporal Priority of Context Effects THE DIRECT ACCESS VIEW Most contemporary theorists advocate the superiority of contextual over lexical pro- cesses. They assume a single mechanism that is sensitive to both linguistic and nonlin- guistic information. On this view, contex- tual information interacts with lexical pro- cesses very early on, and when context is sufﬁciently rich and supportive, it allows comprehension to proceed smoothly and seamlessly, selectively accessing appropriate meanings while blocking incompatible albeit salient ones. Consequently, early processes should involve no contextually inappropri- ate phase (Ortony, Schallert, Reynolds, & Antos, 1978). This should be particularly true of meanings of complete phrases or sen- tences (Gibbs, 1994). Given that a strong prior context allows early processes to involve no inappropri- ate outputs, no suppression or retention of such outputs is anticipated when later interpretation processes take place. That is, a view that attributes to (rich) contextual information a major role in the early stages of comprehension, predicts no differences between metaphors and literals embedded in such a context (see Ortony et al., 1978). This view, however, will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to account for the involvement of “inappro- priate” literal meanings in metaphor com- prehension and interpretation (examples 2–4; though one could argue they might be reactivated). THE CONSTRAINT-BASED SATISFACTION MODEL A more recent version of the direct access view is the constraint-based satisfaction model. According to this view, comprehen- sion is achieved through parallel satisfac- tion of multiple probabilistic constraints, including constraints from lexical represen- tations. According to constraint-based mod- els, if contextual constraints outnumber lexical constraints, they will win over, and comprehension will proceed seamlessly, tap- ping only appropriate meanings (Katz & Ferretti, 2001, 2003; Pexman, Ferretti, & Katz, 2000). According to this version of the direct access view, differences in processes would be a result of difference in the amount of constraints biased in favor of one inter- pretation rather than between literals and metaphors. On the Temporal Priority of Lexical Meanings THE STANDARD PRAGMATIC MODEL The direct access view argues against the standard pragmatic model (Grice, 1975; Searle, 1979), which posits the priority of literal meanings. This view, which assumes that literal meanings of both words and sen- tences should be accessed initially, regard- less of contextual information, concedes that the consequences of initial input analyses are accidental. While they may result in contex- tual ﬁt, they might just as well lead to mis- match with prior context, which would then have to be redressed. Alleviating such disso- nances would, in many cases, invite suppres- sion of contextually inappropriate outputs. The standard pragmatic model, then, pre- dicts initial literally oriented processes for both literals and metaphors, with a second stage of adjustment in the case of metaphors only. According to this model, somewhat\n146 RACHEL GIORA downstream, literal meanings of metaphors will have to be suppressed. Much like the direct access view, this view will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to account for the involvement of ‘inappropriate’ literal meanings in metaphor comprehension and interpretation as shown by examples 2–4, though, again, one could argue that these meanings might be reacti- vated. THE UNDERSPECIFICATION VIEW The underspeciﬁcation model of metaphor comprehension (Frisson & Pickering, 2001; Pickering & Frisson, 2001) also posits the pri- ority of lexical effects. It assumes that lexical entries are stored as highly abstract, under- speciﬁed entities. Initially, metaphors (and other polysemies) are accessed via a single, abstract core. Context effects should occur following lexical access and determine the contextually appropriate, speciﬁc meaning of the metaphor. Results indeed show that only when resolution is required, compre- henders use contextual information to home in on the more speciﬁc, contextually appro- priate sense. Somewhat similar views are enter- tained by relevance-oriented theoreti- cians (Carston, 2002; Sperber & Wilson, 1986/1995, this volume). Though there is no commitment to an underspeciﬁcation view, metaphor interpretation is taken to be fully shaped by context only following initial access of minimal output – logical forms and linguistic meanings. The ﬁnal interpretation is achieved via loosening and narrowing down of these initial outputs (Carston, 2002, pp. 323–359). Narrowing down involves the extension of conceptual material and is thus consistent with an underspeciﬁcation view of the lexicon. Loosening, which involves the subtraction of conceptual material, seems less so. Discarding features of a concept that has already been accessed, however, is in line with the view that metaphor interpretation involves suppression of inappropriate fea- tures. But this might just as well be true of literals as well. On this view, then, literals and metaphors need not differ. THE GRADED SALIENCE HYPOTHESIS Following the modular view (Fodor, 1983), the graded salience hypothesis (Giora, 1997, 1999, 2003; Peleg, Giora, & Fein, 2001, 2004) assumes two distinct mechanisms that run parallel. One is bottom-up, stim- ulus driven, and sensitive only to linguis- tic stimuli; another is top-down, predictive and integrative, and sensitive to both linguis- tic and extra-linguistic knowledge. Unlike the traditional modular assumption (Fodor, 1983), however, the graded salience hypoth- esis assumes that the bottom-up, modular mechanism is salience sensitive: more salient responses – responses coded in the men- tal lexicon and foremost on our mind due to, for example, conventionality, frequency, familiarity, or prototypicality – are accessed faster than and reach sufﬁcient levels of acti- vation before less salient ones. Accordingly, such responses would be accessed upon encounter, regardless of contextual infor- mation or authorial intent. Low salience responses, however, may not reach a thresh- old and may not be visible in a context biased toward the more salient meaning of the stim- ulus. Nonsalient meanings are not coded. They are constructed on the ﬂy as a result of top-down processes. Though this model seems to argue in favor of the temporal priority of salient responses, it does not discard the possibil- ity of the temporal priority of nonsalient meanings. Rather, a highly predictive con- text may facilitate responses on its own accord very early on. Still, it would not inter- fere with automatic, stimulus-driven lexical processes and would not block activation of salient responses. Though the contex- tual mechanism has a predictive role that may speed up derivation of the appropri- ate responses, it would not obstruct inap- propriate, coded responses upon encounter of the stimulus. Indeed, contextual infor- mation may be strong and even faster than lexical processes, so that it may evoke appro- priate meanings even before the linguistic stimulus is encountered. This may be par- ticularly true when the stimulus is placed at the end of a strong sentential context, after most information has been accumulated and\nIS METAPHOR UNIQUE? 147 integrated, allowing effective guessing and inferential processes. However, it does not interact with lexical processes but runs parallel (Peleg et al., 2001, 2004). Unlike the modular view (Fodor, 1983), then, the graded salience hypothesis does not always predict slower contextual effects and resul- tant sequential processes. Neither does it assume that activation of a whole linguis- tic unit should be accomplished before con- textual information comes into play. Rather, across the communication route, context and linguistic processes run parallel, with contextual information evoking meanings on its own accord, yet affecting only the end product of the linguistic process. Additionally, the graded salience hypoth- esis does not assume that contextually inap- propriate meanings should be discarded unconditionally on account of their local contextual misﬁt (for a different view, see Gernsbacher, Keysar, Robertson, & Werner, 2001; Swinney, 1979). Instead, it views late processes such as retention of relevant and irrelevant information and suppression of contextually inappropriate outputs as more attentive to global discourse considerations, such as global coherence, than to local ones, such as local coherence (Giora, 2003; Giora, Fein, Aschkenazi, et al., 2007). Thus, even if the literal meaning of metaphors seems irrel- evant in a given context (local coherence; negation), it might be retained because it is perceived as instrumental in construct- ing the appropriate metaphoric interpre- tation or as conducive to the interpreta- tion of the next expression in line (global coherence). This might explain the avail- ability of the apparently inappropriate literal meaning of pay lip service in the extended novel metaphor pay hard cash (3) which follows it (global resonance). This may also account for the availability of this literal meaning in the metaphors (credit; loaner; pay day) that follow the negated metaphor (do not include such an obvious barter) in (4). This might also explain the availability of an inappropriate, metaphorically related meaning (fast) in the following (originally Hebrew) negated metaphor (in bold for convenience), which was retained in the mind of the producer echoing his interlocu- tor’s thought, in spite of a local cue to the contrary: (5) A: Listen, with your car, you are there, maximally, in 5 minutes . . . B: Come on . . . My Daihatsu is not a jet. A fast car . . . superb car . . . But there’s a limit . . . (Cited in Altiti & Arvatz, 2005; Giora, 2006) This view of suppression and retention, then, runs counter to the assumptions of the alternative models and suggests that both retention and suppression are not automatic but attentive to global discourse considera- tions. According to the graded salience hypoth- esis, then, the relevant distinction is not between metaphors and literals but between salient and less salient meanings. Salient meanings will always be accessed, which explains the involvement of such mean- ings in examples 1–5, regardless of ﬁgura- tiveness or literality. Less salient meanings will lag behind. Retention and suppression will affect salient and less salient meanings alike, whether or not they are “appropriate,” depending on their discourse role. Context Effects: Inhibition/ Suppression/Retention Although the direct access models and the standard pragmatic approach disagree as to whether early processes are sensitive to prior contextual information, they agree that later processes are. This is also true of the relevance theoretic account and the under- speciﬁcation model. On these views, the output of later integration processes involves only contextually appropriate meanings. Even if inappropriate senses have inﬁltrated early processes, they would later be subdued by a rich and supportive context and be replaced with contextually appropriate alternatives. Thus, if My surgeon is a butcher involves reference to a literal “butcher” whose salient property is “using knives to chop messily or clumsily,” this literal\n148 RACHEL GIORA property would be discarded once the abstract metaphoric sense of “messiness and clumsiness” is constructed (Glucksberg, Newsome, & Goldvarg, 2001). In contrast, according to the suppression/retention hypothesis supplementing the graded salience hypothesis (Giora, 2003; Giora & Fein, 1999b), suppression of salient, “inappropriate” meanings is not automatic. It would take effect only if meanings interfere with constructing the appropriate interpretation. However, if these meanings are not detrimental to comprehension or if they are conducive to the appropriate interpretation (e.g., the literal meaning of metaphors and ironies), suppression would not be triggered (see Giora, Fein, Laadan, Wolfson, Zeituny, Kidron, Kaufman, and Shaham, 2007). Indeed, at times, salient meanings would not be suppressed even when they interfere with contextually appropriate interpretations, because they would be too hard to quench on account of their high salience (e.g., the idiomatic meanings of familiar idioms, see example 9). Theories, then, that do not subscribe to early inhibition processes, acknowledge later suppression effects whether automatic or pragmatically oriented. According to the direct access view and the constraints-based model, however, one could, in fact, expect early inhibition of inappropriate meanings. Thus, when con- text is strong and supportive, initial acti- vation of inappropriate word and sentence meanings will be aborted. Such processing should result in exclusive activation of con- textually appropriate products. Inhibition, then, relates to early context effects, which should be able to monitor initial activation of responses. Findings Inhibition of Contextually Inappropriate Properties Is there support for the view that context penetrates lexical processes and selects con- textually appropriate meanings exclusively while inhibiting incompatible ones? In Peleg et al. (2001), we argued against the inhibi- tion hypothesis. Using lexical decision tasks, we demonstrated that even a strong and sup- portive (Hebrew) context (Sarit’s sons and mine went on ﬁghting continuously. Sarit said to me: These delinquents won’t let us have a moment of peace) did not inhibit salient but contextually incompatible meanings (“criminal”) of targets (delinquent) which were as available as contextually compati- ble meanings (“kids”). This was true even where contextual information should have been highly effective, as when target words were placed at the end of sentences and probed immediately afterward (Sarit’s sons and mine went on ﬁghting continuously. Sarit said to me: A moment of peace won’t let us have these delinquents). Similarly, in Rubio Fern´andez (2007), fol- lowing ﬁguratively biasing contexts, such as John doesn’t like physical contact. Even his girl friend ﬁnds it difﬁcult to come close to him. John is a cactus., salient, literal mean- ings, whether directly relevant to the (novel) metaphor (“spike”) or not (“plant”), were accessed immediately at 0 msec delay and retained even at a 400 msec delay. Likewise, in Hasson and Glucksberg (2006), “inappropriate” ﬁgurative meanings (“fast”) of negated metaphors (The train to Boston was no rocket) related to the metaphoric target (rocket) were accessed ini- tially in spite of a contextual cue (negation) to the contrary. They were accessible at short and medium delays of 150 and 500 msec. Note that even when, due to a strong con- text, reading times of literal and nonliteral interpretations of whole sentences did not differ signiﬁcantly (Inhoff, Lima, & Carroll, 1984; Ortony et al., 1978), incompatible (literal) meanings of metaphors were nonetheless accessed on account of their salience (Brisard, Frisson, & Sandra, 2001; Janus & Bever, 1985). In all, such ﬁndings argue against the inhibition hypothesis. They show that salient meanings were always accessed, regardless of context. Will contextually incompatible mean- ings of whole sentences, rather than just their constituents, be activated, regardless of context? According to the graded salience\nIS METAPHOR UNIQUE? 149 hypothesis (Giora, 1997, 1999, 2003), they will if they are highly salient. Indeed, read- ing times of whole sentences whose sen- tential meaning is salient (e.g., familiar idioms) were slower when rich prior context biased them towards their less salient, literal interpretation (Gibbs, 1980; Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004). There is then no evi- dence for inhibition of highly salient but incompatible meanings when the literal– nonliteral issue is considered. Suppression of Contextually Incompatible Properties Will incompatible meanings activated ini- tially be discarded as inappropriate follow- ing lexical processes? A number of stud- ies have attempted to test suppression of contextually inappropriate, particularly lit- eral meanings of metaphors. An outstand- ing study in this respect is Keysar’s (1994), which showed that suppression of inappro- priate meanings of whole sentences does not distinguish literal from metaphorical inter- pretations. If context falsiﬁes the literal inter- pretation or renders it implausible, compre- henders opt for the metaphorical one; if context renders the metaphorical interpre- tation implausible, readers opt for the lit- eral one. If both are acceptable, comprehen- sion is seamless; if both are unacceptable, comprehension runs into difﬁculty (Keysar, 1989). Context effects thus apply to literal and metaphorical interpretations in a simi- lar fashion. Some theories assume suppression of metaphor “inappropriate” (literal) proper- ties even in the absence of prior context. One such example is the class inclusion view (Cacciari & Glucksberg, 1994; Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990; Shen, 1992). According to this view, metaphors of the form X is a Y (That defense lawyer is a shark) involve a dual ref- erence to both a basic-level (literal) concept (the literal “shark”) and to an ad hoc, super- ordinate category constructed on the basis of the basic-level concept (the metaphor- ical “tenacity”). This dual reference, how- ever, is momentary. Once the superordinate category has been constructed, basic-level information is discarded, enabling a straight- forward, frictionless understanding of the metaphor. Suppression of basic-level infor- mation thus allows for the metaphor vehi- cle to uniquely refer to the superordinate category. To test this suppression hypothesis, Gernsbacher et al. (2001) presented partici- pants with either a metaphoric (That defense lawyer is a shark) or a literal (That large hammerhead is a shark) class inclusion state- ment as primes, followed by basic-level tar- get statements (Sharks are good swimmers). Reading times of basic-level targets were slower following a metaphoric than follow- ing a literal prime. Given that suppression comes with a cost (Gernsbacher, 1990), such ﬁndings are consistent with the view that basic-level meanings are suppressed during metaphor interpretation. However, it is possible that these basic- level (literal) meanings have been rejected on account of their irrelevance to the metaphor interpretation rather than on account of their basic-level abstraction. Had basic-level, metaphor relevant alternatives tested (such as “teeth” or “jaws” when “shark” is at stake), ﬁndings might have been differ- ent. Indeed, in Rubio Fern´andez (2007), fol- lowing a metaphor (John is a cactus), only relevant basic-level meanings (“spike”) were accessible both at short (0, 400 msec) and long (1000 msec) delays. In contrast, irrele- vant superordinate meanings (“plant”) were accessible only at the short delays. Such ﬁnd- ings demonstrate that basic-level meanings need not be discarded on account of their basic-level abstraction. Instead, when rele- vant, they are retainable and partake in the construction of the contextually appropriate metaphoric interpretation despite their con- textual misﬁt. Hasson and Glucksberg’s (2006) study demonstrates reduced levels of activation of irrelevant metaphoric meanings (“fast”) of negated metaphors (The train to Boston was no rocket) presented out of a spe- ciﬁc discourse context. Recall that in their study Hasson and Glucksberg showed that at short delays, incompatible concepts\n150 RACHEL GIORA (“fast”) were accessible, despite a contex- tual (negation) cue to the contrary. How- ever, 1000 msec after offset of the negative statements, no facilitation of incompatible meanings (“fast”) was observed. Following negation, then, and in the absence of a speciﬁc context, metaphor incompatible meanings were reduced to baseline levels. In a follow-up on Hasson and Glucksberg, however, Giora, Fein, Aschkenazi, et al. (2007) showed that once these items were furnished with late relevant contexts (The train to Boston was no rocket. The trip to the city was *fast*, though.), negated metaphors (“rocket”) facilitated related concepts (fast) even as long as 1000 msec following their offset. Such results demonstrate that, in the presence of a context motivating retention, suppression was not triggered. Note, further, that, as predicted by the retention hypothesis (Giora & Fein, 1999a, 1999b) studies investigating afﬁrma- tive metaphors demonstrated that only inap- propriate meanings that interfered with the ﬁnal interpretation of the utterances were suppressed. In contrast, incompatible mean- ings (e.g., literal meanings of metaphors) conducive to the ﬁnal interpretation of non- literal utterance were retained. Thus, in Williams (1992), salient meanings (“strict”) of familiar metaphors (ﬁrm) were shown to be activated initially, regardless of context (about “teacher,” “bed”). They were how- ever suppressed only in a context (about “bed”) in which they were disruptive. In con- trast, salient meanings (“solid”) conducive to the utterance interpretation (ﬁrm teacher) retained their initial levels of activation even after a long delay, despite their apparent inappropriateness. Complementarily, ﬁndings obtained from word-fragment completion tasks, which tap later processes, showed that salient (lit- eral) meanings of low familiar idioms were retained in idiomatically biasing contexts, suggesting that their apparent inappropri- ateness or “irrelevance” in that context did not trigger their suppression (Giora & Fein, 1999b). Indeed, as assumed by the sup- pression/retention hypothesis (Giora, 2003; Giora & Fein, 1999b), since metaphoric and idiomatic interpretations of such strings rely on their literal interpretation for their ﬁnal output, there is no need for these irrelevant interpretations to be discarded, as they are not disruptive (see also Cacciari & Glucks- berg, 1995). Additional support for this pragmatic view of suppression comes from ﬁndings that in literally biasing contexts, retention of the literal interpretations of idioms superceded that of the idiomatic meanings of idioms. In these contexts, where in fact the idiomatic meanings had no role in constructing the ﬁnal literal interpretation of the utterance, they were not retained. The same pat- tern was found for high and low famil- iar metaphors (though not for unfamiliar metaphors; Giora & Fein, 1999b). Interest- ingly the opposite was found for familiar proverbs and their familiar literal interpre- tation (Ferretti, Schwint, & Katz, 2007). In an ERP study, Ferretti et al. found that, although reading times did not distinguish ﬁgurative from literal targets, brain waves indicated ease of processing in literally rather than in ﬁguratively biasing contexts. It might be the case that the familiar proverbial meaning of proverbs does not interfere with its literal interpretation. In all, such ﬁnd- ings support the view that metaphors and literals are processed along the same lines. When the literal interpretation is disruptive to metaphoric interpretation it is discarded (Giora & Fein, 1999b; Rubio Fern´andez, 2007; Williams, 1992); when the metaphoric interpretation interferes with making sense of ﬁgurative items biased towards their lit- eral interpretations, these interpretations are discarded (Giora & Fein, 1999b). When it is not, it is retained (Ferretti et al., 2007). Is suppression triggered when no speciﬁc context is mentioned? Not really. Indeed, when tested out of a given context, familiar metaphoric words seemed to discard their metaphoric meaning in the left hemisphere. However, these meanings were retained in the right hemisphere. For instance, in Anaki, Faust, and Kravetz (1998), word primes (stinging), having salient metaphoric and lit- eral meanings, were shown to be accessed both literally and metaphorically in the left\nIS METAPHOR UNIQUE? 151 hemisphere but only metaphorically in the right hemisphere. However, after a delay, the metaphoric meaning was retained only in the right hemisphere, while in the left hemi- sphere, it was suppressed, retaining only the literal meaning. The left hemisphere, then, discarded the metaphoric information, which was, however, retained in the right hemisphere. Retention of Contextually Incompatible Properties According to the retention hypothesis (Giora, 2003; Giora & Fein, 1999b), mean- ings made available by lexical processes would be retained even when contextu- ally incompatible provided they are con- ducive, or, at least, not detrimental to the ﬁnal representation of the output. Evidence of retention of such incompatible meanings was found in the lab as well as in naturally occurring discourses. Recall that in Williams (1992) and Rubio Fern´andez (2007), salient, literal meanings of metaphors, which were shown to be activated initially regardless of contextual ﬁt, were retained when they contributed to the ﬁnal interpretation of the utterance. However, meanings, which were disruptive to the metaphor represen- tation, were not preserved (see previous section). Similar ﬁndings were also demon- strated by Allbritton (1992, as reported in Gibbs, 1994; see also Allbritton, McKoon, & Gerrig, 1995). In this study, recognition of incompatible, literally related probes (“boil- ing”) was facilitated following a paragraph that instantiated a conventional metaphor involving this meaning both in the out- set (Edward was boiling with anger) and at the end – at the priming sentence posi- tion (Hoping to prevent a scene, she tried to lower his thermostat). Such facilitation was not observed following a similar paragraph whose ﬁnal priming sentence was unre- lated to that metaphor. In addition, peo- ple showed preference for metaphor res- onance. They preferred metaphorical text progression, instantiating the same literal source domain, over one that did not. Thus, blow your stack was preferred over bite your head off (both alluding to anger) as a continuation of a description of anger, which was put in terms of heated ﬂuid in a container (Gibbs, 1994, p. 163; Nayak & Gibbs, 1990). This suggests that so- called metaphor irrelevant meanings might be retained for discoursal purposes such as maintenance of metaphor resonance. (For evidence demonstrating lack of metaphori- cal resonance, see Shen & Balaban, 1999). These ﬁndings, then, suggest that, instead of suppressing locally incompatible meanings (e.g., literal meanings of metaphors), context might affect their retention because they might become instrumental in future pro- cesses (see Giora, Fein, Aschkenazi, et al., 2007). Instances of natural discourses, which elaborate on early mention of metaphor irrelevant meanings, also support the reten- tion hypothesis (see examples 2 and 3 above). For example, a recent ad promoting an Israeli daily (Haaretz) abounds in refer- ences to the literal, irrelevant meaning of the metaphor used. The slogan – Haaretz. Food for thought – is placed against a background image of a jam jar whose label resonates with the literal meaning of the slogan: Haaretz – without a populist sweetener. In addition, there is a text extending this metaphor, elab- orating on its literal meaning: “Haaretz is inviting you to entertain and digest new insights. Haaretz is feeding you with a variety of ideas and opinions. Some of them might even be different from yours. So What? They are only an appetizer”. All these form an array of conventional metaphors whose lit- eral meanings, even those within the scope of negation, are retained and resonate with each other.2 Indeed, a survey of some spoken Ameri- can discourses reveals that the incompatible literal meanings of both conventional and novel metaphors are echoed and resonated with in late contexts by both the producer of the speech and her or his interlocutor (Giora, 2003). Consider, for instance, the elaboration on the literal meaning of the “death” metaphor (gone) in where did they go to (Du Bois, Chafe, Meyer, & Thompson, 2000, SBC: 005):\n152 RACHEL GIORA (6) PAMELA: . . . (H) I just think it’s so wei = rd, that they’re go = ne. . . . and where did they go to. This is also true of written discourses as shown by Giora and Balaban (2001). Giora and Balaban collected 60 metaphors from the op-ed section of Haaretz, half of which were literally resonated with by their late context. Findings showed that novel and familiar metaphors were equally likely to be followed by a reference to their literal mean- ing (see 7 below for a recent example). That is, the metaphors, whose literal meaning was resonated with and elaborated on in the immediate or next context, were not evalu- ated as more or less familiar than those that received no literal extension. Importantly, half of the metaphors that received the highest familiarity ratings had literal exten- sions. These ﬁndings suggest that meanings made available to the producer herself were not discarded automatically, even when con- textually incompatible. They were also not retained automatically. Instead, both their suppression and preservation seemed atten- tive to global discourse consideration rather than to local cues such as local irrelevance. (7) The billionaires’ racehorses Fifteen years ago, in an interview with Hadashot, the late Swiss millionaire Gabai Maimon called Benjamin Netanyahu “my racehorse.” Netanyahu’s friends in the Likud were scandalized by the blunt language, but ever since, it has been clear that every pri- mary race to elect the party’s candidates for Knesset brings out new racehorses from the stables of the wealthy. In effect, any self- respecting businessman now keeps at least one such racehorse in his stable (Kim, 2004). This is also true of contrastive metaphors, which resonate with the opposite of the literal meaning of a prior metaphoric occurrence: (8) A war in Iraq will soon break out, and with it a great darkness will descend on events in the territories . . . This is the time to caution us all that under the cover of that darkness, grave things may come to pass. Not that there is much light there now, either. (Levy, 2003) This last metaphor (Not that there is much light there now, either) is particularly illus- trative because it has an ironic reading. As shown in Giora, Fein, Ganzi, and Alkeslassy Levi (2005), negation of an overstatement (much light) results in an ironic reading. This was also true of negated metaphoric overstatements (Giora, Fein, & Aschke- nazi, 2004). In Giora, Fein, and Aschke- nazi, (2004), the negative metaphors used in Hasson and Glucksberg (2006), which contained top-of-the-scale expressions (The train to Boston was no rocket), were rated as more ironic than literal equivalents that did not make up an overstatement (The train to Boston was not fast). Clearly, to be read as such, these ironies must have retained their salient but “irrelevant” metaphoric mean- ing. Indeed, in Pexman et al. (2000), ironic metaphors took longer to read than baseline literals, suggesting that more than one inter- pretation was involved in the ﬁnal represen- tation (see also Colston & Gibbs, 2002). At times, contextually incompatible meanings are retained because they are too salient to be quenched. Consider the joke Iddo cracks in the following example (9, cited in Giora, 2003, p. 19). The episode took place at Iddo’s home while he and Omri (native speakers of Hebrew, aged 7 years and 8 months) were eating supper and Iddo had just fetched himself a glass of juice out of the refrigerator: (9) Omri: I want to drink too. Iddo’s mother: Iddo, totci lo et ha-mic (“take the juice out [of the refrigerator] for him”). Iddo (laughingly) ha . . . ha . . . le- hotci lo et ha-mic (“to take/squeeze the juice out of him” –a Hebrew idiom meaning “drive him crazy”). While the contextually compatible inter- pretation of this idiom is literal, the salient idiomatic meaning could not escape the addressee’s mind. Though disruptive, it\nIS METAPHOR UNIQUE? 153 was difﬁcult to suppress and was therefore retained for humorous purposes. Findings, then, demonstrating retention of contextually incompatible meanings, irrespective of ﬁgurativeness or literalness, are explainable only by the graded salience hypothesis and the suppression/retention hypothesis (Giora, 1997, 1999, 2003; Giora & Fein, 1999b). They are not account- able by the alternative models.3 Metaphor and Discourse Coherence Would metaphors and literals affect dis- course coherence differently? Are meta- phors unique in this sense? According to the standard pragmatic model (Grice, 1975; Searle, 1979) they are: metaphors but not their literal interpretations involve an overt breach of a coherence norm to be allevi- ated by inferential processes of adjustment to contextual information. On this view, metaphors should take longer to read than literals and should score lower on coherence ratings. The direct access view anticipates no processing difﬁculties for metaphors rel- ative to their literal interpretation when prior context is rich and supportive (Gibbs, 1994; Ortony et al., 1978). It therefore pre- dicts similar reading times for metaphors and their literal counterparts and similar coherence ratings for the two interpreta- tions. The underspeciﬁcation view also pre- dicts similar coherence ratings. According to the graded salience hypothesis (Giora, 1997, 1999, 2003), the relevant distinction is not between literals and metaphors but between various degrees of meaning salience. Thus, contextually compatible but less or non- salient meanings would often take longer to activate (depending on their sentential posi- tion, see Peleg et al., 2001, 2004) and would be rated as less coherent than contextu- ally compatible but salient meanings, regard- less of metaphoricity. This predicts that utterances whose less or nonsalient inter- pretation is contextually compatible (novel metaphors intended ﬁguratively; highly familiar metaphors and idioms intended literally) would take longer to read and would be rated as less coherent than their more accessible counterparts (literal meanings of novel metaphors intended literally; ﬁgurative meanings of highly famil- iar metaphors and idioms intended ﬁgura- tively). However, similarly familiar utter- ances (familiar metaphors intended ﬁgura- tively and their familiar literal interpreta- tions intended literally) would take equally long to read and would be rated as similarly coherent. Coherence, then, is not a matter of literality or ﬁgurativeness but a function of the salience of the intended interpretations. Indeed, as predicted by the graded salience hypothesis, idioms (spill the beans) took longer to read in a context inviting their less salient, literal interpretation than in a context inviting their more salient idiomatic meaning (Gibbs, 1980; Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004). Novel metaphors (their bone density is not like ours) took longer to read in a context inviting their nonsalient, ﬁgura- tive interpretation than in a context inviting their more accessible, literal interpretation (Giora & Fein, 1999b, see also Brisard et al., 2001; for different ﬁndings see Ortony et al., 1978); familiar metaphors (wake up) did not take longer to read than their familiar literal interpretations (Giora & Fein, 1999b). Similarly, as predicted by the graded salience hypothesis, contextually compati- ble familiar metaphors and their literal inter- pretation did not vary in terms of coherence. In contrast, contextually compatible novel metaphors were rated as less ﬁtting with prior context than their literal equivalents. In addition, most highly familiar metaphors (big eyes) were rated as less coherent when embedded in a context inviting their less salient literal interpretation than in a con- text inviting their highly salient ﬁgurative meaning (Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004; Shuval & Giora, 2005). Coherence then is sensitive to degree of salience rather than to literality or metaphoricity. Metaphor and Aesthetics Is ﬁgurativeness unique in that it is more pleasing or aesthetic or more creative than\n154 RACHEL GIORA literal language, as assumed by the classical view of metaphor (Aristotle, 350 BCE-a, b; see also Sopory & Dillard, 2002)? Accord- ing to the optimal innovation hypothesis (Giora, 2003; Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004), it is not. Instead, it is optimal inno- vativeness that is aesthetic. An optimally innovative stimulus is one that evokes a novel response while allowing for the recov- ery of a salient one from which it differs qualitatively. Smash Capitalism in the con- text of example (2) constitutes an optimal innovation. While activating the salient non- literal sense of the expression, it also allows an insight into its more concrete, less salient, literal interpretation from which it differs signiﬁcantly. Optimal innovation would thus be more pleasing than either a more or a less familiar stimulus, regardless of ﬁgura- tiveness. Findings indeed showed that metaphoric interpretations of novel metaphors, which, by deﬁnition, are optimally innovative, were rated as more pleasing than their more famil- iar, literal counterparts. In contrast, no such difference was found for familiar metaphors and their literal interpretations, which were rated as similarly pleasing. Given that both their literal and nonliteral meanings enjoy similar salience, they do not involve optimal novelty and were therefore indistinguishable from each other. In contrast, since the less salient, literal interpretations of highly famil- iar metaphors constitute optimal innova- tions, they were rated as more pleasing than their salient, metaphoric meanings (Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004; Shuval & Giora, 2005). These studies support the view that it is not ﬁgurativeness that accounts for aes- thetic judgments but optimal innovative- ness. Neurological Correlates and Processing Mechanisms The bulk of evidence adduced so far argues against the literal/nonliteral divide. Would more direct evidence such as neural corre- lates support this lack of distinction? Recent ﬁndings from brain research and brain imag- ing indeed support the view that the cru- cial distinction is not between literals and nonliterals but between salient and less or nonsalient meanings (Giora, 2007). While the left hemisphere was found to special- ize in processing salient meanings of famil- iar stimuli, the right hemisphere was found to specialize in processing less or unfa- miliar stimuli, regardless of metaphoric- ity (Arzouan, Goldstein, & Faust, 2007; Eviatar & Just, 2006; Giora & Stringaris, in press; Giora, Zaidel, Soroker, Batori, & Kasher, 2000; Mashal & Faust, 2008; Mashal, Faust, & Hendler, 2005; Mashal, Faust, Hendler, & Jung-Beeman 2007; Papagno, Oliveri, & Romero, 2002; Schmidt, DeBuse, & Seger, 2007; Sotillo et al., 2005; Sun- dermeier, Virtue, Marsolek, & van den Broek, 2005). Such studies corroborate ear- lier results showing that the left hemisphere is engaged in processing conventional verbal metaphors (Winner & Gardner, 1977) while the right hemisphere is engaged in process- ing novel metaphors (Bottini et al., 1994). An exception in this respect is a study by Rapp, Leube, Erb, Grodd, & Kircher (2004), who found activation in the left hemisphere for novel metaphors. It is possible, however, that this was affected by a nonlinguistic task, which involved judging whether the tar- gets had a positive or negative connotation (p. 401). But even utterances having similarly familiar interpretations such as literal (Some men are soldiers) and metaphoric (Some men are lions) class inclusion statements, tak- ing similarly long to read, might involve some different underlying processes. Using brain imaging, Stringaris, Medford, Bram- mer, Giampietro, and David (2007) showed that while these similarly accessible targets were largely processed in the left hemi- sphere, they engaged different areas in that part of the brain. Speciﬁcally, they showed that, in addition to increased involvement of areas classically associated with linguistic processing, the left thalamus was recruited for the processing of metaphors but not of literals (see also Mashal et al., in press. For somewhat conﬂicting ﬁndings, see Mashal et al., 2007, in which not just two-word\nIS METAPHOR UNIQUE? 155 metaphoric expressions but also such literal expressions activated the left thalamus com- pared to meaningless expressions). Stringaris et al. suggest that this might highlight some difference between metaphoric and literal class inclusion statements. In the former, but not in the latter, processing involves the identiﬁcation of shared properties resulting in the construction of a novel and emer- gent ad hoc concept. Such ﬁndings might allude to metaphors’ open-endedness, they argue. Indeed, such ﬁndings tie up with studies demonstrating that ﬁgurative expres- sions such as idioms, while being understood more quickly than literal paraphrases, con- vey a wider range of entailments (Gibbs, 1992). They further agree with the assump- tion that ﬁgurative language may be more poetic in that it allows for a wider range of weak implicatures than literals (Sperber & Wilson, 1986/1995). These claims, however, will have to be tested against studies of lit- eral puns of various degrees of salience and literal optimal innovations, which seem to make up a more appropriate literal counter- part for metaphors than the literals exam- ined (see Coulson & Severens, 2007; Mashal et al., in press, for an initiation). In any event, such studies suggest that the time it takes to process an utterance is not necessarily a good indicator of the underlying processes involved. Is metaphor processing different from irony interpretation? Colston and Gibbs (2002) embedded metaphoric utterances (This one’s really sharp) in irony and metaphor inducing contexts. They showed that targets took longer to read when intended ironically than when intended metaphorically. However, a close look at the items used suggests that, while most of the targets had a salient metaphoric sense, their ironic interpretation was novel, which might explain the different reading times found. A similar attempt to compare metaphors and ironies was made by Pexman et al. (2000). Using moving windows, Pexman et al. embedded familiar (Children are pre- cious gems) and less familiar metaphors (Her mind is an active volcano) in irony induc- ing contexts. They found that reading times of less familiar (metaphoric and ironic) tar- gets, measured at the ﬁgurative key word (volcano) of the statement, at the space fol- lowing that word, and at the ﬁrst word of the next sentence, increased relative to familiar items (embedded in metaphor inviting con- texts). Such ﬁndings do not attest to differ- ences involved in irony and metaphor pro- cessing. Rather, they contrast familiar and unfamiliar metaphors but equate unfamiliar instances of both irony and metaphor. They thus disclose differences involved in process- ing items of different salience. Indeed, neural correlates of the processes involved in mak- ing sense of conventional metaphors ver- sus nonconventional ironies reveal special- ization of the left hemisphere in processing metaphors and selective right hemisphere involvement in comprehension of nonsalient ironic language (Eviatar & Just, 2006; Giora et al., 2000). Although metaphor and irony involve different comparison processes (sim- ilarity vs. contrast), there is not enough evi- dence yet to suggest that they are processed differently. Counterexamples? On the view that, unlike literals, many metaphors involve conceptual mappings from source to target domain (notably Lakoff, this volume; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Lakoff & Turner, 1989), metaphor might indeed be unique. But is it really the case that source to target domain map- pings are different for metaphors than for literal expressions? According to Coulson (Coulson, this volume; Coulson & Van Petten, 2002) it is not. Rather, some liter- als involve literal mappings comparable to metaphors. For instance, in That stone we saw in the natural history museum is a gem, the lit- eral sense of the target word (gem) conveys its conventional, literal meaning and should involve simple processes. However, The ring was made of tin, with a pebble instead of a gem invites literal mappings – mappings of con- ceptual structure from a different domain. It should therefore require more complex pro- cesses. In contrast, processing the target in\n156 RACHEL GIORA After giving it some thought, I realized the new idea is a gem should induce most complex processes, because the speaker’s idea should induce metaphorical mapping – it should be metaphorically linked to a gemstone to evoke properties such as brightness and clarity. Findings indeed show that metaphors elicited the largest N400s (N400 brain waves’ amplitude is largest for contex- tually incompatible or surprising items). Next came the literal mappings, eliciting larger N400s than the literals. These results, thus, establish a complexity continuum in place of the literal/nonliteral divide (for a salience-based analysis of these ﬁndings, see Giora, 2003, p. 120). In addition, evi- dence from research into optimal innova- tions (Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004) allows us to suspect that literal (Till barriers do them part, see 1) and metaphorical optimal innovations might involve similar mapping processes. Conclusions Is metaphor unique in any sense then? Although we might have entertained the thought that metaphor is special, most of the evidence adduced so far offers but limited support of it (see also Giora, 2002). Rather, the bulk of evidence presented here argues against the literal/nonliteral distinction. Instead, it proposes the salient–nonsalient continuum. Thus, there is ample evidence suggesting that meanings are accessed in order of their salience rather than in rela- tion to their literality or nonliterality. Simi- larly, there is also enough evidence showing that it is not the incompatible literal mean- ing of metaphors that is always suppressed. Suppression might discard irrelevant mean- ings regardless of ﬁgurativeness or literality. Similarly, it is not only the irrelevant lit- eral meaning that is retained. Once contex- tual processes invite retention of irrelevant meanings, they are retained regardless of lit- eralness or nonliteralness. Similarly, it is not metaphor that is incoherent; it is less and at times nonsalient meanings that are difﬁcult to integrate into recently constructed repre- sentations. Likewise, it is not metaphor that is pleasing; it is optimal innovation that is aesthetic, whether literal or nonliteral (for more research on the non-uniqueness issue, see also Giora, 2002, 2003, 2007; Giora & Stringaris, in press). Is metaphor unique in that it is, at least, the only source of metaphoric or poetic effects? The following poem (10) by Aharon Shabtai (2005: 8; my translation) might dis- abuse us even of this belief. Although the poem is entirely literal, involving literal sim- iles, it results in metaphorical implicatures. Thus, “Sharon is like a man” implies that the Israeli Prime Minister is not human – not a “man” in the metaphoric sense: (10) Sharon is like a man Sharon is like a man, And the dawning peace is like peace And the newspaper trumpeting it Is like a newspaper, The teachers are like teachers, And education is like education. Out of the window of bus number 5 I look at the people on the sidewalks, Following them in my thought, And it all conﬁrms They are like people, The shoes, the bitten falafel, etc. At the grocery, In nervous hands I test the potatoes And they too, they too Are like potatoes. Metaphor, then, is not the only source of poetics or even of metaphorical interpreta- tions. It seems that notions such as “reso- nance” (Du Bois, 1998) and “optimal inno- vation” (Giora, Fein, Kronrod, et al., 2004) can be considered as additional sources for poetic effects.

Notes 1 In Du Bois (1998), resonance is deﬁned as “the catalytic activation of potential afﬁni- ties across utterances,” which while activating afﬁnities may also induce change. 2 For the view suggesting that these meanings might emanate from their “root metaphor,” that is, from preexisting conceptual mappings between conceptual domains, see Lakoff (this volume) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980). 3 Retention of meanings made available by interlocutors during conversation or dur- ing writing might originate in and allow for a more comprehensive communicative machinery titled “dialogic syntax” (Du Bois, 1998, 2001), whose verbal manifestation results in a vast amount of resonance of speak- ers’ utterances with their own and others’ utterances.

Gibbs, Jr., and Teenie Matlock Metaphor, Imagination, and Simulation: Psycholinguistic Evidence A person with a sharp eye can ﬁnd metaphors almost anywhere. A public bul- letin board on the University of California, Santa Cruz, campus once had a ﬂyer with a picture of a large black boot, typical of those worn by students, with the words You have feet. Stomp out racism in your scene, fol- lowed by an invitation to attend a campus meeting on the topic. This ﬂyer was notable with the contrast between the picture and the caption, because, after all, one cannot physically stomp out an abstract idea or con- cept like racism. Of course, racism is mani- fested in concrete behavior such as language and other acts. But the concept of racism also refers to certain beliefs and attitudes that are distinctly immaterial and cannot be stomped out, regardless of what sort of fashionable boot one is wearing. When students were asked about their reactions to the ﬂyer and their understand- ing of stomp out racism, they all observed the humor in the juxtaposition of the pic- ture and caption; yet, none thought that there was anything unusual about the idea of stomping out an abstract idea such as racism. “It’s sort of a metaphor,” as one woman said, because “you can’t really stomp out racism with your feet, but you can use your efforts to stop racism by ﬁnding and killing it, as if stomping out a nasty insect crawling on the ground.” Another student said that he could “think of racism as if it were some object, or a living thing, that does terrible dam- age and needs to be stopped or squashed, before it hurts other people.” A third stu- dent explained, “Racist people have to be stopped. As horrible as it sounds, these peo- ple need to be controlled, and destroyed, or at least the beliefs they have. Racism needs to be stopped dead in its tracks.” These students’ comments reﬂect their immediate, off-the-cuff imaginative under- standings of the phrase stomp out racism by conceiving racism as if it was a physi- cal being or object with the ability to hurt others that must be eradicated by those with the power to do so. Consistent with this ﬁgurative reading, people envisioned stomp out racism by imagining their bodies in action against the metaphorical object or 161\n162 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK living entity of racism, which is a speciﬁc instantiation of the more general concep- tual metaphor AN IDEA IS AN OBJECT OR LIVING ENTITY. We maintain that students’ impressions of stomp out racism illustrate a fundamental process by which metaphorical language is interpreted. People understand metaphors by creating an imaginative sim- ulation of their bodies in action that mim- ics the events alluded to by the metaphor. Understanding the word stomp in stomp out racism is not done by accessing some highly abstract meaning that captures something of all physical and nonphysical uses of stomp. Interpreting the metaphorical meaning of stomp out racism also does not require that the concrete, physical features of stomp be completely inhibited or ignored. However, under our view, the physical, embodied meaning of stomp makes perfect sense in combination with racism when this abstract concept is conceptualized metaphorically. Much research in cognitive linguistics suggests that many abstract concepts, such as racism, are understood, at least partly, in embodied metaphorical terms (Gibbs, 1994, 2006; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999). For example, understanding the conventional phrase Our relationship is at a crossroad is partly accomplished through the activa- tion of the conceptual metaphor ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS A JOURNEY. This endur- ing chunk of metaphorical thought has a source domain (e.g., JOURNEY) that is grounded in the pervasive bodily experi- ence, or image-schema, of SOURCE-PATH- GOAL, which together give the idea RELA- TIONSHIP its embodied character. Psycholin- guistic research shows that people appear to access embodied conceptual metaphors in some form when interpreting why many words and phrases have the metaphori- cal meanings they do, as well as when they immediately comprehend many verbal metaphors (Gibbs, 1994, 2006a). We claim in this chapter that the recruit- ment of embodied metaphors in some aspects of verbal metaphor understanding is done imaginatively as people re-create what it must be like to engage in similar actions. The key to this imaginative process is simu- lation, in this case the mental enactment of the very action referred to in the metaphor. For example, abstract concepts are often understood as physical objects that can be touched, held on to, dropped, and, indeed, stomped on. When hearing stomp out racism, listeners imagine engaging in a relevant body action, such as stomping with their feet, that facilitates metaphorical construal of the abstract notion of racism as a physical entity. Although there is no physical action per- formed, the mental simulation created has embodied elements as people imagine them- selves performing the relevant action. In this way, simulating what it must be like to engage in similar actions facilitates the recruitment of embodied metaphors in some aspects of verbal metaphor understanding. Our purpose in this chapter is to make the case for embodied simulation in a the- ory of metaphor understanding. We do this by describing relevant research from cogni- tive science on the importance of embod- ied simulation in cognition and language use. We then discuss current experimental work from psycholinguistics that is consis- tent with the claim that embodied simu- lations are created during metaphor under- standing. Embodied Simulation People simulate all sorts of things in all sorts of ways. Some simulations are phys- ical and serve a communicative function. Imagine, for instance, that you are sitting in a restaurant in a foreign country. You have long ﬁnished your meal and want to pay the bill. Eventually, you manage to catch your waiter’s attention and pretend to scrib- ble something in the air. In doing so, you are replacing the word bill, or its appropri- ate equivalent, with an iconic gesture that you assume will be familiar to him. The waiter understands and brings you the bill. Imagine next that you have just gotten on a crowded bus and see an old friend out- side on the street. She waves and you then hold your hand up to your ear as if you are holding a cell phone. As the bus is pulling\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 163 away, your friend nods and does the same in return. In both the restaurant and on the bus, you do a physical action that communicates something clear and unambiguous to your interlocutor. You simulate physical actions (signing a bill, making a phone call) that are familiar and grounded in shared knowledge. Such actions are common in everyday situ- ations in which speech may not sufﬁce on its own, or in which speech is not possi- ble (Bavelas, Kenwood, Johnson, & Phillips, 2002; Clark & Krych, 2004). People typically simulate actions or objects in these situations that are familiar and can readily be under- stood. Other physical simulations are not com- municative but are useful to performing var- ious cognitive tasks such as problem solv- ing. Imagine you are learning to play Tetris, a popular video game. In this game, two- dimensional shapes fall one at a time from the top of the screen, landing on the bot- tom or on top of shapes that have already landed. The object of the game is to ﬁll rows of squares all the way across. Filled rows dissolve and move down, and unﬁlled rows stack up. The game ends when incom- plete rows stack up and reach the top of the playing ﬁeld. As you decide where to place pieces, you press keys on a keypad to move them right or left, spin them clockwise or counterclockwise, or suddenly drop them to the bottom. Counter to what would be expected, as you become better at the game, you do more and more seemingly superﬂu- ous actions. For instance, you rapidly spin a piece to the right position before drop- ping it. Such actions might not seem use- ful while you are playing the game because they are not always necessary and take extra time. Yet they are useful because they allow you to simulate many possible placements before you move a piece to its ﬁnal loca- tion (see Kirsh & Maglio, 1994). Or imagine you are playing the word game Scrabble. As you wait for your turn, you move your tiles around before placing them on the board. In doing so, you simulate words to be played by activating new letter conﬁgurations that would not be available without moving them around (Maglio, Matlock, Raphaely, Chernicky, & Kirsh, 1999). Using physical actions to simulate future actions or states is not limited to playing games. It’s part of everyday reasoning. Imagine that you are presented with two glasses of water. Both glasses are the same height and both are half full, but one is thin and one is wide. You are asked whether water will pour from the thin glass or the wide glass ﬁrst if the glasses are tilted at the same rate. Like most people, you are likely to give an incorrect answer if you make this judgment on the ﬂy. However, if you are asked to pretend that you are tilting the glass, you are more likely to provide a correct answer (that the wide glass will pour the water ﬁrst) (Schwartz & Black, 1999). The role of physical actions or imagined physical actions in all these cases is impor- tant. In reasoning about everyday events and actions, people frequently engage in physical simulations as a way of “ofﬂoading” mental computation into the world, which makes problem solving much easier (Clark, 1997). Other simulations are purely mental. If you close your eyes and imagine your house right now, you can “see” various objects and rooms. You can visually scan from one object to another, or “walk” from one part of the house to another. You are constructing a spatial mental model from your memory of a place that shares certain attributes with that actual physical space (Bower & Mor- row, 1990). As you “go” through the house, you can imagine moving quickly or slowly (Morrow & Clark, 1988). You can keep track of where objects are or where they once were by anchoring them to other objects (Morrow, Bower, & Greenspan, 1989). You can change your perspective from a sub- jective viewpoint to a more objective one, such as from your own perspective as the mover to a bird’s-eye perspective (Tversky, 1996). You can also construct a spatial men- tal model when reading a description of a scene or seeing a graphical depiction, such as a map (Denis & Cocude, 1989). In all cases, when you imagine yourself or another per- son going through a house or any other spa- tial environment, you are simulating motion, and to some extent, that motion shares prop- erties with actual movement in the world,\n164 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK either perceived or enacted (Tversky, 2000; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). One of the interesting elements of embodied simulations is that people engage in these processes not only when motion is explicitly mentioned (e.g., when imagining stomping out something or moving through a house) but also when motion is to some degree implicit. For example, studies show that people infer the presence of motion when they read handwriting (Babcock & Freyd, 1988) or view a series of photographs where motion between the events depicted is implied (Freyd, 1983). Thus, people per- ceive handwriting displays based on the ges- tures that produced them and not just the static features of the letters. Neuroscience research reveals that brain areas associated with visual processing of motion are active when people see both pictures depicting real and implied motion (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000). These ﬁndings suggest that process- ing implied motion in static scenes is very similar to perception of real motion. All of these different studies suggest that people can readily, and mostly uncon- sciously, create simulations of real-world events as they communicate with others, hear stories, solve problems, and even per- ceive motionless displays. Psycholinguistic studies also demonstrate the importance of embodied simulations in ordinary language understanding. For instance, reading sen- tences with visual semantic components can selectively interfere with visual processing. Thus, participants in one study took longer to perform a visual categorization task in the upper part of their visual ﬁeld when they heard sentences depicting upward motion, such as The ant climbed (Richardson, Spivey, Barsalou, & McRae, 2003). When people perform physical actions, such as forming a ﬁst or moving a lever toward the body, they were slower to verify as meaningful sentences that described unrelated actions, such as aim a dart (Klatzky, Pelligrino, McCloskey, & Doherty, 1989), and close the drawer (Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002). More- over, performing a simple physical action, such as rotating a knob in a clockwise direc- tion, can interfere with people’s speed com- prehension of statements like Eric turned down the volume, which describes a scenario where a person moves his or her wrist in a counterclockwise manner (Zwaan & Tay- lor, 2006). In general, these psycholinguis- tic studies demonstrate that people’s under- standing of linguistic descriptions of action mentally simulate the action. As such, there is signiﬁcant psycholinguistic evidence con- sistent with the broad claim that language use is closely tied to embodied imagination. Many cognitive scientists, especially philosophers, describe cognitive simulations as conscious, deliberative acts of pretense (Goldman, 2006; Gordon, 1986; Harris, 1992). But simulation processes that are critical to language processing are differ- ent from engaging in pretense (Currie & Ravenscroft, 2002) and are likely automatic, unconscious, and prereﬂexive (Gallese, 2000). Thus, one pretends to do something (e.g., talking on a telephone) by performing some other, somewhat analogous, action (e.g., holding your hand in a particular shape by your ear). On the other hand, most imaginative simulations are mental actions where one is not doing one thing to stand for another but where one mentally engages in actions similar to those overtly referred to. For instance, when Ray imagines what it feels like to kick a football, he does not engage in some other action, such as kicking a cantaloupe. Instead, he mentally constructs a scenario of his own body kicking a football. This simulation is not abstract in the way, for example, that a computer simulation of a hurricane mimics abstract elements of how a hurricane moves. Embodied simulations often have a bodily feel to them, in the way that a person may experience sensations of movement when ﬂying an aircraft simulator (Gibbs, 2006a). People may not necessarily be aware of these sensations, as demonstrated by research on ideomotor actions, indicating that peo- ple often unconsciously move in similar patterns to others around them (Knuf, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001). Embodied simulations are imaginative acts that are intimately involved with subpersonal pro- cesses (Currie & Ravenscroft, 2002) and,\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 165 in most cases, are performed automatically without signiﬁcant conscious reﬂection. Studies on Metaphorical Simulation The research from cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics suggests that people can easily simulate motion, especially rele- vant to bodily movement, when they were engaged in various cognitive tasks, includ- ing nonmetaphorical language understand- ing. But do people simulate motion in situ- ations that are physically impossible to do, such as those represented by metaphorical phrases like grasp a concept and stomp out racism? The studies described next asked people to do different things in experi- mental situations that tap into various con- scious and unconscious mental processes, such as imagining metaphorical actions and answering questions about their images, draw maps depicting metaphorical events, making appropriate responses to metaphori- cal statements, reading metaphorical phrases after performing, or imagine performing, different bodily movements, and walk while thinking about the meaning of metaphorical narratives. Some of these experiments examined the products of metaphor understanding (i.e., the meanings people inferred), while oth- ers investigated the processes by which peo- ple construct these products. One must be careful to not draw unwarranted conclusions about the processes of linguistic understand- ing from an examination of products alone or assume that fast-occurring mental processes necessarily reﬂect much about the eventual products of those interpretation processes (Gibbs, 1994). Yet the experimental exam- ination of both the processes and product of understanding are useful to demonstrate different aspects of how people automati- cally construct imaginative understandings of metaphors that are closely tied to their mental simulating the actions referred to by these expressions. Metaphorical simulations are not abstract, or amodal, but are created in terms of “as if” bodily action, where peo- ple imagine moving their bodies in ways spe- ciﬁc to their metaphorical understandings of the abstract concepts noted in metaphorical statements, such as grasp a concept. Many psycholinguists studying metaphor use do not endorse our claim that metaphors are understood in terms of embodied sim- ulations. These scholars suggest that many of the types of metaphorical expressions studied in the research described below are not actually metaphors, or understood by processes linked to bodily processes related to mental simulations. Although it is quite possible that different theoretical accounts may be needed to explain various kinds of metaphorical language (e.g., “A is B” metaphors vs. metaphors arising from corre- lations in experience), we will argue later on that embodied simulations may be required to understand even classic “A is B,” or resemblance, metaphors. For the moment, the research described examines different aspects of how embodied simulations enable people to make sense of various metaphor- ical expressions, draw speciﬁc inferences about their meanings, and immediately com- prehend these expressions in certain exper- imental situations. We suggest as a method- ological imperative that one cannot dismiss the idea of embodied simulations as being critical to metaphor interpretation unless one has explicitly looked for such evidence and failed to ﬁnd it. However, much cur- rent psycholinguistic research indicates that positive evidence in favor of the simulation account can be readily observed as we now report. Imagining Impossible Actions Asking people to describe their understand- ing of stomp out racism reveals that peo- ple can easily imagine ways that an abstract idea like racism can be physically stomped out. For some, this ability to imagine con- cretely physically impossible events may seem odd. But people’s pervasive schemes of metaphorical thought, in which abstract concepts are often metaphorically under- stood in concrete ways, enables them to imagine the impossible and makes it seem quite plausible.\n166 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK There have been many experimental studies investigating people’s abilities to form mental images for metaphorical phrases (Gibbs & O’Brien, 1990; Gibbs, Strom, & Spivey-Knowlton, 1997), which reveal that conceptual metaphors constrain the kinds of images people have for expres- sions like spill the beans and don’t put all your eggs in one basket. These metaphori- cal expressions, however, may be easy to imagine because they are sensible when used concretely, because one can, for instance, literally spill the beans in some situations. But can people form mental images for physically impossible actions that express metaphorical meaning, such as stomp out racism or grasp the concept? If so, might these imaginative creations arise as a result of embodied simulations? One set of experiments explored these questions by comparing people’s mental images for concrete (e.g., chew on the gum) and metaphorical (e.g., chew on the idea) phrases (Gibbs, Gould, & Andric, 2006). Unlike imagining nonmetaphoriocal action statements (e.g., chew on the gum), where people’s images should focus on the proce- dural characteristics of the concrete actions (i.e., moving their mouths as they chew the gum), people’s mental images for metaphor- ical phrases should show an analogical understanding of how abstract domains, such as ideas or concepts, can be actively structured in terms of embodied source domains (i.e., chewing on something to get more out of it). Participants were ﬁrst presented speciﬁc phrases that were either metaphorical or nonmetaphorical, given 10 seconds to form a mental image of that action, and asked, “What is particularly noticeable in your image?” People’s responses could be roughly divided into two groups. The ﬁrst set of answers made some speciﬁc reference to the participants actually participating in the action mentioned in the statement. For example, “My jaw goes up and down as I chew,” was one response given to “chew on the idea.” People gave far more of these spe- ciﬁc references to participating in the action responses for the nonmetaphors (63%) than to the metaphors (29%). But for the metaphors, people gave sig- niﬁcantly more conceptualized descriptions of the action (71%) than they did for the nonmetaphors (37%). For instance, for the metaphor stretch for understanding, one per- son said that the most noticeable thing in his image was “there is much stretching going in both in terms of the ideas being stretched out to see if they are true and me stretching to better see of examine the idea.” The participant essentially noted that IDEAS ARE OBJECTS which can be physically inspected by stretching them out to more effectively examine them, and that UNDER- STANDING IS GRASPING enables the person to extend his or her body to better con- trol the object, and thus better understand it. This response concretely illustrates how embodied metaphors constrain the mental images people construct when interpreting metaphorical action statements. Participants were also asked, “Why is this concept (e.g., idea) sometimes associ- ated with this action (e.g., chewing)?” Once more, people could give a concrete explana- tion of the relevant process or action, such as, “That is what you do with gum – chew on it” for chew on the gum. But for the metaphors, people speciﬁcally provided analogous, con- ceptual explanations as to why some concept was sometimes associated with some action or process. For example, for the metaphor- ical phrase chew on the idea, one person said, “Chewing is related to a slow method- ological activity and it could be related to turning something over in your mind to better understand it.” Overall, people gave analogous, conceptual explanations far more often to the metaphors (77%) than to the nonmetaphors (36%), showing that peo- ple’s mental images for metaphorical action phrases are constrained by their embodied, metaphorical understandings of the target domains referred to in these expressions (e.g., ideas, concepts, feelings). If people understood metaphors by engaging in embodied simulations, then moving their bodies in ways relevant to the actions mentioned should enhance the creation of these simulations. A second study again presented people with dif- ferent metaphorical and nonmetaphorical\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 167 expressions, formed mental images for these phrases, and then answered a series of ques- tions about their images. In Experiment 2, however, people also participated in one of three enactment conditions in which they ﬁrst did one of three things: (a) watched the experimenter make a bodily action relevant to the main verb in each statement (e.g., making a stretching motion before form- ing a mental image for the phrase stretch for understanding), (b) watched the experi- menter make a relevant bodily action, which they then imitated, before being given 10 seconds to form their mental image for a phrase, or (c) watched the experimenter make a relevant bodily action, then imagined themselves doing the same action, before forming a mental image for the phrase. These three experimental treatments were referred to as the watching, imitating, and imagining conditions, respectively. This study showed, once more, that across all three enactment conditions, 78% of these referred to additional bodily actions and con- sequences of these actions related to the main verb in each metaphorical phrase. For example, when one participant was given the phrase put your ﬁnger on the truth (in the imagine condition), she replied, “I guess being able to touch the truth is an important thing, being able to relate to it, being able to actually see that it is a physical thing and can be examined.” This evidence shows how moving the body in relevant ways enhances the creation of embodied simulations, com- pared to Experiment 1 where no movement was performed. These actions enabled peo- ple to construct more easily embodied sim- ulation that made these impossible actions, like grasping the concept, plausible and mean- ingful. Real and Imagined Bodily Movement Enhances Simulations during Immediate Metaphor Comprehension The extent to which people ordinarily engage in imagistic processes during imme- diate metaphor processing that they can con- sciously reﬂect on is unclear. But one pos- sibility is that moving the body, or overtly imagining moving the body, in relevant ways facilitates immediate metaphor comprehen- sion. If abstract concepts are indeed under- stood as items that can be acted upon by the body, then performing a related action should facilitate sensibility judgments for a ﬁgurative phrase that mentions this action. For example, if participants ﬁrst move their arms and hands as if to grasp something and then read grasp the concept, they should verify that this phrase is meaningful faster than when they ﬁrst performed an unre- lated body action. Engaging in body move- ments associated with these phrases should enhance the online simulations that people create to form a metaphorical understanding of abstract notions, such as concept, even if a concept is not something that can be physi- cally grasped. In fact, a computerized reading-time study showed that participants responded more quickly to the metaphorical phrases that matched the preceding action (e.g., the motor action grasp was followed by grasp the concept), than to the phrases that did not match the earlier movement (e.g., the motor action kick was followed by grasp the con- cept) (Wilson & Gibbs, 2007). People were also faster in responding to the metaphor phrases having performed a relevant body movement than when they did not move at all. In short, performing an action facil- itates understanding of a metaphoric phrase containing that action word. One possibil- ity is that people’s bodily action prompted them to think of the verb in the subsequently presented phrase (e.g., a grasping action led people to think of the word grasp). But a control study showed that people were not especially good at thinking of the exact word in the phrase when they just performed the bodily action, and that there was no correla- tion between successful identiﬁcation of the actual word and priming effects for that item in the reading time experiment. It appears, then, that moving in an appropriate manner does not activate a lexical item but enhances how people create a relevant embodied sim- ulation to understand a metaphorical phrase. A second study asked people to imag- ine speciﬁc bodily actions before they made their speeded responses to word strings. Once again, participants were faster to\n168 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK process the metaphors when the act imag- ined was consistent with the meaning of the phrase than when the imagined act was inconsistent. This result reveals that real movement is not required to facilitate metaphor comprehension, only that people mentally simulate such action. Once again, a control study demonstrated that this ﬁnd- ing was not due to simple lexical associations created from doing or imagining the actions and seeing speciﬁc words in the phrases. Most theories of metaphor understanding assume that people must inhibit the physical meaning of a word like grasp in grasp the con- cept to properly infer its abstract, metaphoric meaning (Glucksberg, 2001). This view sug- gests that having people make a grasp- ing motion before reading grasp the con- cept should interfere with their immediate processing of the phrase. Yet the present studies show this is not the case. Real and imagined body movement helps people cre- ate embodied simulations of metaphorical meanings that involve “what it must be like” processes that make use of tactile- kinesthetic experiences. People may not cre- ate a complete literal interpretation for a phrase like grasp the concept, and reject that in favor of a metaphorical reading. But they do use their embodied understanding of var- ious action verbs to construct metaphori- cal interpretations of abstract concepts to make meaningful combinations of the phys- ical with the abstract. Of course, the stud- ies discussed here did not examine normal metaphor comprehension in context, and seeing how appropriate discourse situations, where various bodily actions are also per- formed, affect metaphor understanding. But this is an exciting topic for future psycholin- guistic research. Bodily Imagination in Thinking about Time Imagine that you have a meeting scheduled for this coming Wednesday when a colleague approaches you and says, Next Wednesday’s meeting has been moved forward two days. Would the meeting now be held on Monday or Friday of that week? Your answer to this question depends on your interpretation of moved forward, which alludes to the fact that people often conceptualize time in terms of physical space. But do people ordinar- ily simulate actual movement forward as part of their understanding of time state- ments such that referring to next Wednes- day’s meeting? One possibility is that many people’s embodied simulations for time con- cepts depend on their current bodily move- ments. Many studies have examined people’s experience of time, including the way they talk about time metaphorically. In a series of studies by Boroditsky and Ramscar (2002), students waiting in line at a caf´e were given the statement Next Wednesday’s meet- ing has been moved forward two days and then asked What day is the meeting that has been rescheduled? (The question was adapted from McGlone & Harding, 1998.) Students who were farther along in the line (i.e., who had thus very recently experienced more for- ward spatial motion) were more likely to say that the meeting had been moved to Friday. Similarly, people riding a train were pre- sented the same ambiguous statement and question about the rescheduled meeting. Passengers who were at the end of their jour- neys reported that the meeting was moved to Friday signiﬁcantly more than did peo- ple in the middle of their journeys. Although both groups of passengers were experiencing the same physical experience of sitting in a moving train, they thought differently about their journey and consequently responded differently to the rescheduled meeting ques- tion. These results demonstrate how ongo- ing sensorimotor experience has an inﬂuence on people’s comprehension of metaphorical statements about time. As seen in the stud- ies on imagining and understanding grasp the concept, moving the body in particular ways can facilitate people’s creation of sim- ulations of action relevant to the actions referred to by metaphoric language that alters the way these metaphors are inter- preted. Having people perform different types of movement can also affect their under- standing of time metaphors. Participants in\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 169 another experiment were asked to study a drawing that depicted a chair with a rope attached (Boroditsky & Ramscar, 2002). Half of the participants imagined that they were pulling the chair toward them with the rope. The other half imagined being seated in the chair, pulling themselves forward along the rope. Following the imagination activ- ity, the participants were asked the same question about the meeting being moved forward two days. Participants who imag- ined pulling the chair toward their bodies were more likely to answer that the meeting had been moved to Monday, consistent with the metaphorical idea that time is an object moving toward them. Conversely, the par- ticipants who imagined pulling themselves along the rope more often answered that the meeting had been rescheduled for Friday, consistent with the idea that time is a stationary object with the person moving toward it. Once again, ongoing body move- ment shapes online metaphor understand- ing, suggesting that people simulate what time, in this case, is like in relation to their bodies, which affects the way we respond to the metaphorical time question (see also Gentner, Imai, & Boroditsky, 2002; McGlone & Harding, 1998; N´u˜nez, Motz, & Teuscher, 2006). Fictive Motion and Embodied Simulation Suppose a Realtor is talking to you on the phone about a piece of property. He uses descriptions such as There’s an apple orchard that runs along the hillside and A dirt road goes across a creek. How do you make sense of his descriptions given that he is using motion verbs (runs, goes) but there is no actual motion? Such sentences are common in English, and you readily generate an image of an elongated orchard that “goes” from one point on a hillside to another. In pro- cessing the sentence, you understand that no actual motion transpires because you know that things like orchards and dirt roads can’t move and you are used to hearing sentences that have inanimate subjects; yet, in scanning from one part of the image to another, you experience a ﬂeeting sense of motion. This subjective sense of motion is what Talmy (1996) and others have called ﬁctive motion (see also Langacker, 1987; Mat- sumoto, 1996). Some language theorists have questioned whether any sort of motion imagery is involved in processing ﬁctive motion sen- tences (Jackendoff, 2002). But several psy- cholinguistic experiments have provided evidence to support the idea that people do simulate motion in processing these sen- tences. Participants in one set of experiments were timed as they read ﬁctive motion target sentences, such as The road goes through the desert, at the end of stories about protago- nists traveling through physical space (Mat- lock, 2004). Overall, people took less time to read and make a decision about these ﬁctive motion sentences after they had read about travel that was fast (versus slow), over a short distance (versus long), or through an easy terrain (versus difﬁcult). But critically, peo- ple did not differ in the time it took them to read nonﬁctive motion sentences (e.g., The road is in the desert) under the same condi- tions. The results of these studies indicate that thought about actual movement can inﬂuence the time it takes to process ﬁc- tive motion sentences. For instance, when people think about slow motion, they simu- late more slowly when thinking about ﬁctive motion. The results suggest that embodied simulation is part of understanding a com- mon form of ﬁgurative language. Other research supports the idea that ﬁctive motion includes simulated motion. Matlock, Ramscar, and Boroditsky (2005) tested whether ﬁctive motion would inﬂu- ence people’s understanding of time because relatively abstract ideas about time and the understanding of ﬁctive motion both involve a shared underlying representational for- mat extracted from our concrete experience with actual moving objects. In one experi- ment, participants ﬁrst read sentences with or without ﬁctive motion, such as The tattoo runs along his spine or The tattoo is next to his spine, and then drew the meaning conveyed by the sentence. Next, they answered the ambiguous question adapted from McGlone and Harding (1998) and used in Boroditsky\n170 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK and Ramscar (2002), Next Wednesday’s meet- ing has been moved forward two days. What day is the meeting now that it has been rescheduled? People were more likely to respond Friday (versus Monday) if they had read and drawn a ﬁctive motion sentence but were evenly divided in their answers if they had read and drawn a nonﬁctive motion sentence. Fictive motion depictions included more motion elements (e.g., cars, bikes) than did nonﬁctive motion sentences (see Mat- lock, Ramscar, & Boroditsky, 2004). In a second experiment, participants read one of four ﬁctive motion sentences that var- ied according to magnitude of ﬁctive motion, deﬁned as the number of scan points along a path (i.e., Four / 8 / 20 / over 80 pine trees run along the driveway). The question was whether more scan points would encourage more movement through time, and hence, more Fridays. Participants were more likely to say Friday than Monday overall. How- ever, the difference was enhanced for people who had read sentences with 8 and 20 scan points (pine trees) and nonexistent for peo- ple who had read sentences with very few (4) or very many (over 80) scan points, suggest- ing that number of scan points (and hence, more ﬁctive motion simulation) promoted more motion through time. In a third experiment, people read and drew ﬁctive motion sentences with motion “going away” from or “coming” toward the individual (e.g., The road goes/comes all the way to/from New York). The goal was to investigate whether ﬁctive motion simula- tion included a diffuse, undirected type of motion or a more directed type of motion. The results showed that participants were more likely to say Friday when the direc- tion was going away from them, and more likely to say Monday when the direction was coming toward them, suggesting that ﬁctive motion simulation includes direction. This set of studies shows that people engage in thought about motion when think- ing about ﬁctive motion and when they are thinking about time. So, for instance, when people have done a ﬁctive motion simula- tion, they imagine forward motion, and this encourages them to take a forward mov- ing perspective and move forward through time. And when the path they have thought about is long, they are even more likely to think about forward movement through time. Last, when people simulate motion along a path as they read The road goes all the way to New York, they are predisposed to then move forward through time, specif- ically, to Friday. Follow-up studies with the same ambigu- ous time question provide further evidence that ﬁctive motion can inﬂuence the under- standing of time metaphors (see Ramscar, Matlock, & Boroditsky, in progress). Even when participants draw no picture to con- vey the meaning of a ﬁctive or a nonﬁc- tive motion sentence, they are more likely to say Friday than Monday with ﬁctive motion. They are also more likely to say Friday with a “just right” number of scan points and with ﬁctive motion “going away” from them. The results of this control study are important because they demonstrate that the effect was not due to hand movements while draw- ing the meaning conveyed by the sentence. Other work shows that counting direction can inﬂuence the understanding of time (see Matlock, Ramscar, & Srinivasan, 2006). Peo- ple are more likely to respond Friday to the ambiguous time question after counting from 5 to 17, and more likely to say Monday after counting from 17 to 5. The results indi- cate that “going” from number to number either away from zero or toward zero, the default position of the speaker or listener (see Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2001), encourages peo- ple to conceptually move forward through time or back through time. The results pro- vide further evidence that people simulate motion even when there is no explicit mover to imagine, and novel evidence that they do so even when there is no physical space to imagine. Other psycholinguistic research has explored whether ﬁctive motion language affects people’s visual processing of spatial scenes (Matlock & Richardson, 2004). Par- ticipants’ eye movements were tracked as they were presented with simple drawings of trajectories, such as roads, rivers, and pipelines, while they passively heard either\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 171 ﬁctive motion or nonﬁctive motion descrip- tions such as The road goes through the valley, The road is in the valley. When peo- ple heard ﬁctive motion descriptions they spent more time inspecting the trajectory region of the scene than when they heard nonﬁctive motion descriptions. Follow-up work ruled out the possibility that ﬁctive motion descriptions were simply more interesting, and that alone attracted more visual attention to trajectory region versus other parts of the picture (Richardson & Matlock, 2007). Together these eye-tracking studies provide additional evidence that people engage in embodied simulation when they are processing ﬁctive motion sentences. Finally, data from a map task provide fur- ther evidence that ﬁctive motion includes mentally simulated motion. Pairs of partic- ipants were asked to put landmarks on a blank map where a director told a map- maker what to do (Matlock & Clark, 2006). All pairs drew the same map with the same lines. Some participants drew lines that represented roads, while others drew lines that represented pipelines. Overall, par- ticipants who depicted roads used more motion verbs and produced more path ges- ture (sweeping gestures that go from one point in space to another) than those who produced identical lines for pipelines. These results suggest that in giving directions about how to draw a system of roads the direc- tor was drawing on knowledge about what roads are ordinarily used for, in particu- lar, for travel through space. Drawing on that knowledge and putting it into verbal or visual form allows the director to simulate motion and invite the listener to simulate motion. Together these psycholinguistic studies on ﬁctive motion demonstrate that peo- ple naturally and tacitly simulate motion in understanding everyday spatial descriptions such as The road goes through the park or A fence runs along the coastline. The results show that ﬁgurative language understanding included embodied simulation that draws on what is known about motion through per- ception and action. Walking the Walk While Thinking about Metaphorical Talk Many of the psycholinguistic studies described in this chapter illustrate how bodily action, and imagining speciﬁc bodily acts, constrains, and often facilitates people’s interpretation of verbal metaphor. These real and imaginative bodily reenactments had speciﬁc consequences for how peo- ple interpreted the meanings of various metaphors. We now discuss a novel situation in which the embodied simulation created to understand metaphor affects how people move their whole bodies as they continue to think about what they have heard. Consider the following two brief narratives about the development of two different romantic relationships. STORY A Imagine that you are a single person. A friend sets you up on a blind date. You really like this person and start dating a lot. Your rela- tionship was moving along in a good direc- tion. But then it got even better. The rela- tionship felt like it was the best you ever had. This continues to this day. No matter what happens, the two of you are quite happy together. STORY B Imagine that you are a single person. A friend sets you up on a blind date. You really like this person and start dating a lot. Your relationship was moving along in a good direction. But then you encoun- tered some difﬁculties. The relationship did not feel the same as before. This lasted for some time. No matter how hard you two tried, the two of you were not getting along. Story A describes a successful relation- ship, while B describes a relationship that appears to be in trouble. Both stories are similar, however, in conceiving of the rela- tionships as entities that can move along some sort of path (RELATIONSHIPS ARE JOURNEYS), as indicated in the fourth line Your relationship was moving along in a good direction. Although no other part of the\n172 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK two stories explicitly refers to journeys, the two stories provide different impressions of the “relationship journey.” Thus, Story A suggests a smooth, uninterrupted jour- ney that is still progressing, while Story B implies a more difﬁcult, perhaps inter- rupted, journey that may no longer be progressing. Do people actually draw different infer- ences when reading these two stories? To what extent are the different meanings inferred based on the embodied metaphor RELATIONSHIPS ARE JOURNEYS? One study examined people’s metaphorical interpreta- tions of these two stories by asking them to make judgments about different aspects of the relationships depicted (Gibbs, 2006b). College students speciﬁcally judged the suc- cessful metaphorical relationships (Story A) to be progressing further, moving along in a straighter line and the story participants to be heading more in the same direction than was the case for the unsuccessful metaphor- ical story (Story B). Of course, there is noth- ing in these two stories that directly asserts anything about the distance, speed, extent, and direction of the relationship “journeys” traveled. All of these inferences were drawn on the basis of people’s metaphorical under- standings of the stories as referring to RELA- TIONSHIPS ARE JOURNEYS, as suggested by the Your relationship was moving along in a good direction statement. Might these inferences be based on people’s embodied simulation of the relationships, in which readers imagine moving along in a good direction that is then affected by the subse- quent positive and negative character of the relationships? One new set of studies used a new methodology to examine whether people’s interpretations of simple narratives, like the above stories, partly rely on their embod- ied simulations of the metaphors involved (Gibbs, 2006b). People infer the detailed meanings of simple narratives involving con- ceptual metaphors by imagining their partic- ipation in the metaphorical actions explic- itly mentioned in these stories. For example, when hearing moving along in a good direc- tion, listeners imagine engaging in a body action, such as traveling along some path, which facilitates their metaphoric under- standing of the abstract, and physically impossible, idea that romantic relationships can move along a path toward some goal. If people imaginatively simulate themselves in the journey, then listening to these different renditions of the RELATIONSHIPS ARE JOUR- NEYS conceptual metaphor should have dif- ferent real-world embodied effects. To assess this idea, people listened to one of the two above stories, were blindfolded, and then walked along a path toward an object while they thought about the story. People should walk differently when hearing suc- cessful and unsuccessful metaphor stories, while these effects should be greatly atten- uated after hearing nonmetaphorical narra- tives that did not suggest a conceptualiza- tion of the relationship as a kind of physical journey. This hypothesis was tested in a novel by having participants physically walk toward an object, 40 feet away, after hearing either a successful or unsuccessful story in either the metaphorical or nonmetaphorical condition. Another experimental condition asked par- ticipants to simply imagine walking to the object after hearing one of the stories. Anal- ysis of the walking times generally showed that people walked signiﬁcantly longer for the successful metaphorical stories (15.7 sec- onds) than for the unsuccessful metaphori- cal stories (12.8 seconds), but that this differ- ence was not reliable in the nonmetaphorical condition (14.8 and 14.6 seconds). Analysis of the length of walking (in vertical relation- ship to the target) again showed that peo- ple walked farther for the successful sto- ries (2.4 feet beyond the object) than for the unsuccessful ones (2.3 feet below the object). Another experimental condition asked participants to simply imagine walking to the object after hearing one of the sto- ries. For the imagined condition, partici- pants were blindfolded, heard a story, but were then instructed to only imagine walk- ing out to the yellow ball as they thought about the story and to press a stopwatch as soon as they imagined arriving at the\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 173 ball. The results of the imagine condition showed that people imagined walking longer for the successful metaphor stories (11.4 sec- onds) than for the unsuccessful metaphoric narratives (9.5 seconds). Unlike the data for the walking condition, where no differ- ence was obtained, people imagined walk- ing longer in the unsuccessful condition (12.5 seconds) than in the successful one (9.5 sec- onds). The reason for this latter ﬁnding is not clear. These studies suggest that people’s inter- pretation of the stories partly involved cre- ating an embodied simulation, or a reenact- ment, of the relationship journey alluded to in the different metaphorical narratives. Even though relationships are not physi- cal entities that literally travel along phys- ical paths, people nonetheless conceive of relationships in metaphorical ways, espe- cially when prompted to do so by state- ments like Your relationship was moving along in a good direction. This metaphori- cal conceptualization is not purely abstract but embodied in the sense that partici- pants imagine themselves moving in the dif- ferent relationship journeys which subse- quently affected their walking, and imagin- ing of walking, as they thought about the stories. We recognize that an experiment where people hear stories and then walk blind- folded toward an object is not a traditional method to assess immediate understanding of verbal metaphors. Unlike many of the other studies described in this chapter that examine the processes by which metaphors are understood, the walking experiment looks at the products of people’s inter- pretations. People may have walked dif- ferently in the various conditions of the walking experiment because of imaginative processes that occurred after they had origi- nally heard and understood the metaphor- ical and nonmetaphorical stories. More experimental work is necessary to test for this and other alternative explanations of these ﬁndings. But the results are still in- triguing, and indeed consistent with the embodied simulation view advocated for in this chapter. Conclusion Metaphor is closely allied to human imagina- tion. Our claim in this chapter has been that signiﬁcant aspects of metaphor use involve people simulating what it must be like to engage in speciﬁc bodily actions referred to in metaphorical expressions. These men- tal reenactments ﬁrst demonstrate how the imagination is tied to bodily action and more speciﬁcally suggest the ongoing role that imaginative processes play in verbal metaphor understanding. The vast body of work in cognitive sci- ence showing that simulations are critical to many aspects of cognition and non- metaphorical language use is certainly con- sistent with our arguments about embod- ied simulations in understanding metaphor. Yet the surprising part of the psycholin- guistic research described previously is that people engage in embodied simulations for actions that in many cases are not phys- ically possible to do in the real world, precisely because they involve abstract enti- ties. One may argue, once more, that phys- ical aspects of grasping or moving forward must be ignored or inhibited to understand properly metaphorical expressions such as grasp the concept or the relationship was mov- ing forward in a good direction. But imagin- ing one engaging in these actions is quite sensible given that many abstract concepts are at least partly understood in metaphoric terms. These embodied metaphorical con- ceptions mesh perfectly with bodily actions, such as when one thinks of concepts or racism as a concrete entity, sometimes animate, that can be touched, held on to, controlled, and stomped on. The psycholin- guistic evidence presented here provides different glimpses into how embodied sim- ulations shape people’s immediate inter- pretation and conscious reﬂection of dif- ferent kinds of metaphorical language that is rooted in correlations in bodily experi- ence (e.g., GRASPING IS UNDERSTANDING). We also contend that the empirical ﬁndings reviewed here are inconsistent with claims that (a) people do not understand conven- tional statements such as The road runs along\n174 RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR., AND TEENIE MATLOCK the coastline and He ﬁnally grasped the concept in metaphorical terms, or that (b) people access these ﬁgurative meanings by simply accessing a preestablished sense from a men- tal lexicon without engaging in any imagina- tive bodily activities. One of the peculiar aspects of metaphor scholarship is the degree to which the ﬁeld is split between people studying classic A is B metaphors (e.g., My lawyer is a shark), and those studying metaphors arising from correlations in experience (e.g., I can see the point you are making). Not surprisingly per- haps, people studying these different aspects of metaphor tend to adopt very different theoretical perspectives to explain metaphor in language and thought. Classic or resem- blance metaphors are typically viewed as having little to do with embodied action and are understood through comparison or categorization processes (Gentner and Bowdle, this volume; Glucksberg, this vol- ume). But it may be the case that people construct embodied simulations when they infer the metaphorical meanings of resem- blance metaphors. Consider, for example, some metaphors for teachers: teachers are tour guides, teachers are ﬁshermen, or teach- ers are astronauts. Each of these seems to contrast dissimilar domains where the goal is to understand which aspects of the source domain (e.g., tour guides) gets mapped onto the target domain (e.g., teachers). Yet people are not simply mapping static or relational features of source domains and not just creating some superordinate category of which the target domain is a prototypical member. Instead, people under- standing a statement like teachers are tour guides are constructing an embodied simu- lation of what it must be like to be a tour guide, and using that information to further constrain what the metaphor implies. One Web site (AnnenbergMediaLearner.org) has an interactive workshop for teachers titled, “What’s your metaphor,” where teach- ers write in answers to “What metaphor describes you as a teacher?” and asks partic- ipants to then “explain how this metaphor characterizes you as a teacher.” The remark- able thing about people’s metaphors is that they are the entire “A is B” form, but then describe the metaphor in terms of bodily action. For instance, one person claimed that their metaphor was A teacher is a ﬁsherman, and wrote, “Standing by the river, putting the hook into the water (no barbs on the hook). Constantly guiding the rod down the river, toward the sea of self-fulﬁllment. There are rapids that can cause the ﬁsh to experience a sense of confusion, but the tension from the rod is a constant, guiding them toward calmer waters. This journey cannot be com- pleted by one ﬁsher, the rod is passed to the next ﬁsher (teacher).” This example is representative of how all these teachers interpreted their metaphors. People simulated what it must be like to be a ﬁsherman, tour guide, astronaut and described in detail the actions they would take that may be similar to those done when teaching and what impact they had on their students. Thus, the new category of A teacher is a ﬁsherman, for example, is created and appreciated by running the simulation, or engaging in an “as if” sce- nario where bodily action and its effects are critical to the metaphor’s meaning. In fact, simulating embodied experiences may be critical to many aspects of categorization, not just those having to do with metaphor. One study supporting this idea asked peo- ple to generate exemplars from both com- mon taxonomic categories, such as furniture and fruits, and ad hoc categories, such as things dogs chase or reasons for going on a holiday (Vallee-Tourangeau, Anthony, & Austin, 1998). When people were then asked to describe their strategies for generating the exemplars, participants in both the tax- onomic and ad hoc groups often reported using “experiential mediation.” Thus, when generating exemplars of “fruit,” people did not read off some list in their heads but imag- ined themselves in a familiar grocery store walking in the produce section noting indi- vidual types of fruit as they were encoun- tered. These ﬁndings show that embodied simulation may not be something restricted to creating and understanding ad hoc cat- egories, which include novel metaphors but are applied when common taxonomic\nMETAPHOR, IMAGINATION, AND SIMULATION 175 categories are accessed as well (see Barsalou, 2003).

H. Raskin felt a strange sensation in his right arm and slowly slipped out of consciousness. When he awoke again in New York Hos- pital, his world would never be the same. Raskin had suffered a stroke that resulted in damage to the front portion of his left hemi- sphere. As a result, he was unable to move his right arm and leg, unable to speak, and unable to understand even the simplest lan- guage. Eventually, Raskin regained the abil- ity to walk, to move his arm, and to under- stand what was said to him. Though he did his best to produce nouns and verbs together in an order that others might make sense of, ﬂuent speech remained a challenge for him the rest of his life (Raskin, 1992). Raskin suffered from Broca’s aphasia, a language disorder often accompanied by weakness or paralysis of the right side of the body. Broca’s aphasics have largely intact comprehension abilities but can speak only with effort, typically producing short, tele- graphic phrases. The condition is named after 19th-century neurologist Paul Broca who prompted scientiﬁc discussion as to whether language ability could be local- ized in the brain with his classic report of two patients with profound communica- tive deﬁcits following large left frontal lobe lesions (Broca, 1865). Localization received further support from Broca’s contempo- rary, Wernicke (1874), who reported two patients with severe language comprehen- sion deﬁcits, apparently due to the presence of a lesion in the posterior portion of the left temporal lobe. Although Wernicke’s apha- sics can speak ﬂuently, their speech includes made-up words known as paraphasias (e.g., treen for train), and their sentences are often incoherent. In contrast, the incidence of aphasic deﬁcits in patients with lesions in the right hemisphere is far less common (H´ecaen & Consoli, 1973). Cognitive neuroscientists’ understanding of the relationship between brain activity and language ability derives largely from the study of brain injured patients. Since damage to the front portion of the brain 177\n178 SEANA COULSON is associated with difﬁculty speaking, it is assumed that left frontal areas play a cru- cial role in language production. Similarly, since damage to the posterior portion of the brain is associated with difﬁculty under- standing language, it is assumed that left pos- terior temporal areas play a crucial role in language comprehension. The logic is that the damaged area plays a critical role in the compromised function. Consequently, the left hemisphere (LH) is considered the lan- guage hemisphere, while the right hemi- sphere (RH) is the “minor” hemisphere. However, language deﬁcits have also been associated with damage to the RH. In contrast to the severe language impair- ment in patients with left hemisphere dam- age (LHD), patients with RHD exhibit more subtle deﬁcits involving the relation- ship between an utterance and its context. RHD production, for example, is marked by socially inappropriate remarks, tangential speech, digressions of topic, combined with a failure to utilize nonverbal cues (Joanette, Goulet, & Hannequin, 1990). In experimen- tal studies of their comprehension, RHD patients have been shown to have difﬁ- culty understanding jokes (Bihrle, Brownell, & Gardner, 1986; Brownell, Michel, Pow- elson, & Gardner, 1983), interpreting sar- castic utterances (Giora, Zaidel, Soroker, Batori, & Kasher, 2002; Rehak, Kaplan, & Gardner, 1992), and have been characterized as deriving overly literal interpretations of metaphoric language (Winner & Gardner, 1977). Thus, the left hemisphere is associ- ated with language processing traditionally construed as linguistic, that is, phonological, syntactic, and semantic analysis, while the right hemisphere has been associated with processing typically construed as pragmatic, or extra-linguistic. The role of the two hemispheres in metaphor comprehension thus has poten- tial implications for the dispute in cogni- tive science as to whether metaphor should be considered the province of semantics or pragmatics. According to traditional views, metaphor represents a departure from nor- mal, that is, literal, language use and thus falls within the province of pragmatics (Grice, 1975; Searle, 1979). However, oth- ers have argued that metaphoric mean- ings undermine the very distinction under dispute, that between linguistic and non- linguistic meanings. Ordinary language is replete with metaphors of varying degrees of entrenchment (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999; Sweetser, 1990; Turner, 1991). Moreover, the recruitment of real-world knowledge and local contextual information is necessary for the comprehension of both literal and metaphorical meanings (Coul- son, 2001; Gibbs, 1994; Gibbs & Gerrig, 1989). The relationship between the cognitive and neural processes underlying the compre- hension of literal versus metaphorical lan- guage has thus been a key research issue. Though much research on this topic has uti- lized various behavioral measures of process- ing, cognitive neuroscientists have increas- ingly used measures of brain function to address the validity of particular models of metaphor comprehension. In section 1, we review the use of electrophysiological measures to assess the real-time process- ing of metaphors. These ﬁndings suggest that while metaphor comprehension often recruits increased processing resources, it is inﬂuenced by many of the same variables as is the comprehension of literal language. The commonality between the processing of literal and metaphorical language sug- gested by electrophysiological measures is somewhat puzzling in view of the sugges- tion that metaphor comprehension recruits right hemisphere brain areas not utilized in the processing of literal language. This puzzle is addressed in section 2 as we review the original evidence for the right hemisphere theory of metaphor and counter with more recent evidence that argues against it. This section involves discussion of a number of the different sorts of meth- ods used in cognitive neuroscience, includ- ing the study of patients with brain damage as well as methods such as repetitive tran- scranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that lead to transient damage in otherwise normal people. We discuss experiments that use the divided visual ﬁeld priming paradigm that\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 179 is particularly helpful in drawing inferences about hemispheric differences, along with neuroimaging studies of metaphor compre- hension in healthy adults. These different methodologies provide convergent evidence that the recruitment of right hemisphere areas depends not on the ﬁgurativity of the materials, but on their complexity. Finally, in section 3 we speculate about how the study of the brain might enhance our understanding of metaphor comprehen- sion. We brieﬂy discuss evidence for the sen- sorimotor grounding of concepts in general, and metaphor in particular. In keeping with conceptual metaphor theory, we suggest that metaphor involves the utilization of brain areas implicated in concrete concepts for use in the construal of abstract domains. 1. Real-Time Comprehension of Metaphors The neurophysiology of language processes can be investigated in healthy people via the non-invasive recording of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). ERPs are small volt- age ﬂuctuations in the electroencephalo- gram (EEG) that are time-locked to percep- tual, motor, or cognitive events collected by recording EEG while participants perform a cognitive task such as reading (Rugg & Coles, 1995). By averaging the EEG time- locked to multiple tokens of a given type (e.g., the onset of a word used metaphori- cally), it is possible to isolate aspects of the electrical signal that are temporally associ- ated with the processing of that type of event (such as understanding a metaphoric mean- ing). The result of averaging is a waveform with a series of positive and negative peaks, known as components, and labeled by refer- ence to their polarity (“P” for positive-going and “N” for negative-going), and when they occur relative to the onset of the stimulus event, or relative to other ERP components. Over the past 25 years, cognitive neuro- scientists have identiﬁed ERP components associated with processing different sorts of linguistic information, such as the link between the N400 and semantic integra- tion processes. The N400 component of the ERPs was ﬁrst noted in experiments con- trasting sentences that ended sensibly and predictably with others that ended with an incongruous word. Congruous words elicited a late positive wave, while incongru- ous endings elicited a negative wave begin- ning about 200 ms after word onset and peaking at 400 ms (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). Subsequent experiments have shown that ﬁner gradations of semantic context also modulate N400 amplitude. For example, amplitude shows a strong inverse corre- lation with the predictability of the elic- iting word within a given sentence con- text (Kutas, Lindamood, & Hillyard, 1984). In general, experimental manipulations that make semantic integration more difﬁcult result in larger amplitude N400, while those that facilitate it result in smaller N400. Because ERPs provide an online index of brain activity related to language com- prehension, they have been used to test various models of metaphor comprehen- sion. Pynte, Besson, Robichon, and Poli (1996), for example, used ERPs to address the validity of three hypotheses about metaphor comprehension: the standard model, the parallel hypothesis, and the context-dependent hypothesis. First, the standard pragmatic model posits two discrete stages of metaphor processing, as metaphor- ical meanings are accessed only after the lit- eral meaning has been rejected. This model predicts an initial effect of metaphoricity on the N400, reﬂecting the literal incongruity, followed by a later ERP effect, reﬂecting the access of the metaphorical meaning. How- ever, although metaphors (Those ﬁghters are LIONS) elicited slightly larger N400s than literal controls (Those animals are LIONS), there were no reliable ERP effects after the N400, namely, between 600 and 1200 ms after the onset of the sentence’s ﬁnal word. Pynte and colleagues (1996) thus suggested that the enhanced N400 to the metaphors reﬂected participants’ apprehension of the literal incongruity of these sentences, as pre- dicted by the model. However, the absence of late ERP effects is contrary to the predic- tions of the standard model.\n180 SEANA COULSON In contrast to the standard model, the par- allel hypothesis is that literal and metaphor- ical meanings are processed in parallel. According to the parallel model, if N400 amplitude reﬂects the difﬁculty of com- prehending literal meanings, it should also reﬂect the difﬁculty of comprehending metaphorical meanings. The parallel model thus entails that differences in the com- prehensibility of familiar versus unfamil- iar metaphors should be reﬂected in N400 amplitude. However, when presented out of context, Pynte et al. (1996) found no differ- ences in ERPs elicited by familiar metaphors such as “Those ﬁghters are LIONS,” and unfa- miliar metaphors such as “Those apprentices are LIONS.” The context-dependent hypothesis is the idea that the metaphorical meaning is directly accessed when it is relevant to the preceding context. To test this hypothe- sis, Pynte and colleagues (1996) recorded ERPs as participants read sentences with familiar and unfamiliar metaphors placed in either relevant (e.g., for the lion example, “They are not cowardly”) or irrelevant (e.g., “They are not idiotic”) contexts. The context- dependent hypothesis predicts that regard- less of the familiarity of the metaphor, the relevance of the context should modulate N400 amplitude. Accordingly, Pynte et al. (1996) found that while metaphor familiar- ity did not affect the ERPs, the relevance of the context did. Compared to the rele- vant contexts, metaphors in irrelevant con- texts elicited more negative ERPs in both the N400 window and the subsequent 600–1000 ms interval, suggesting irrelevant metaphors were more difﬁcult to process. Further evidence that metaphorical meanings are activated very early in the processing stream comes from an ERP study of the metaphor interference effect (MIE). The MIE is elicited in a sentence veriﬁcation paradigm in which the subject is given literally true, literally false, and metaphorically true (but literally false) sentences. The MIE refers to the increased response times to reject metaphorically true sentences such as, “The divorce is a night- mare,” compared to literally false sentences such as “The divorce is a table” (Glucksberg, Gildea, & Bookin, 1982). Because the task demands that the participant attend only to the literal meaning of these sen- tences, the MIE is interpreted as reﬂecting the automatic activation of metaphoric meanings. Kazmerski and colleagues recorded ERPs as healthy participants judged the literal truth of sentences such as “Tulips grow from a bulb,” “The beaver is a lumberjack,” and “The rumor is a lumberjack.” They observed an MIE in participants’ reaction times, as it took participants longer to respond “no” to the metaphorical sentences than their literal counterparts (Kazmerski, Blasko, & Dessalegn, 2003). Interestingly, the MIE was only 11 ms in participants with low IQ (<100), but was 35 ms in participants with high IQ (>115). The ERP correlates of the MIE included a smaller N400 for the metaphorically true sentences than the literally false sentences, suggesting partici- pants found metaphorical words easier to process than the anomalous endings, as well as a larger late positivity for the metaphors, perhaps reﬂecting the greater difﬁculty in responding “no” to these items. Moreover, these ERP effects were marked and robust in the high IQ group, but largely absent in the low IQ group whose behavioral MIE was also negligible. Research to date thus suggests that, con- trary to the Standard Model of metaphor comprehension, metaphoric meanings are available quite early in processing, affect- ing the ERPs beginning 250–300 ms after the onset of a metaphorical word (Kazmer- ski et al., 2003; Pynte et al., 1996). Decon- textualized metaphors elicit slightly larger N400s than plausible literal controls such as “Those animals are lions” (Pynte et al., 1996), suggesting they place more demands on semantic integration processes. However, metaphors elicit smaller N400s than implau- sible literal controls such as “The rumor is a lumberjack” (Kazmerski et al., 2003), suggesting they are easier to process than incongruous sentence completions. This lat- ter ﬁnding casts doubt on the suggestion that the enhanced N400 (relative to plausible\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 181 literal endings) elicited by metaphors indexes their literal incongruity. Coulson and Van Petten (2002) have sug- gested that N400 amplitude to metaphors is driven by the complexity of mapping and blending operations involved in the com- prehension of metaphors but also in the comprehension of literal language. In our model, metaphor comprehension involves coordinating various conceptual domains in a blend, a hybrid model that consists of struc- ture from multiple conceptual domains, and that often develops emergent structure of its own. Metaphor comprehension involves the temporary construction of simple cog- nitive models along with the establishment of mappings, or systematic correspondences among objects and relationships represented in various models. Mappings are based on relationships such as identity, similarity, or analogy. Consequently, metaphoric mean- ings – that use analogy to link objects in dif- ferent spaces – do not fundamentally differ from meanings that employ other sorts of mappings. For instance, understanding the metaphor in “All the nurses at the hospital say that surgeon is a butcher,” requires coordinat- ing conceptual structure associated with surgery, butchery, and a blend of the two. To understand this metaphor it is neces- sary to apprehend mappings between sur- geon and butcher, patient and dead animal (e.g., cow), as well as scalpel and cleaver. However, it also involves construction of a blended model that integrates some infor- mation from each of the two domains. In this example, the blend inherits the goals of the surgeon, and the means and manner of the butcher. The inference that the surgeon is incompetent arises when these structures are integrated to create a hypothetical agent with both characteristics. Similar conceptual operations are in- volved in understanding literal language. For example, understanding butcher in “During the war, that surgeon had to work as a butcher,” also requires the comprehender to establish mappings and integrate information about a surgeon’s training and skill with gen- eral information about butchers, and other aspects of the context (Coulson & Matlock, 2001). One might for instance, infer that the surgeon in question was overqualiﬁed for his job, or that he was forced to work as a butcher in a labor camp. Differences in the comprehensibility of these butcher sen- tences, then, might be less a matter of their ﬁgurativity than the extent to which they require the comprehender to activate addi- tional information to establish mappings and elaborate the blend. To test these ideas, Coulson and Van Petten (2002) compared ERPs elicited by words in three different contexts on a con- tinuum from literal to ﬁgurative, as sug- gested by conceptual integration theory (Fauconnier & Turner, 1998). For the literal end of the continuum, they used sentences that prompted a literal reading of the last term, as in “He knows that whiskey is a strong intoxicant.” At the metaphoric end of the continuum, they used sentences such as “He knows that power is a strong intoxicant.” The literal mapping condition, hypothesized to fall somewhere between the literal and the metaphoric uses, involved sentences such as, “He has used cough syrup as an intoxicant.” Literal mapping stimuli employed fully literal uses of words in ways that were hypothesized to include some of the same conceptual operations as in metaphor comprehension. These sentences described cases where one object was substituted for another, one object was mistaken for another, or one object was used to repre- sent another – all contexts that require the comprehender to set up a mapping, that is, understand a correspondence, between the two objects in question and the domains in which they typically occur. In the time window in which the N400 is observed (300–500 ms post-onset), ERPs in all three conditions were qualitatively sim- ilar, displaying similar waveshape and scalp topography, suggesting that processing was similar for all three sorts of contexts. More- over, as predicted, N400 amplitude differed as a function of the metaphoricity, with liter- als eliciting the least N400, literal mappings the next-most, and metaphors the most N400, suggesting a concomitant gradient of\n182 SEANA COULSON processing difﬁculty. The graded N400 dif- ference argues against the literal/ﬁgurative dichotomy inherent in the standard model, and suggests processing difﬁculty associated with ﬁgurative language is related to the complexity of mapping and conceptual inte- gration. Although the comprehension of meta- phoric meanings poses a challenge that is greater than that associated with literal lan- guage of comparable syntactic complexity, there does not seem to be much evidence to support a view of metaphor compre- hension as involving a qualitatively distinct processing mode. ERP studies of metaphor comprehension suggest metaphoric mean- ings are active during the same tempo- ral interval as literal meanings (Kazmerski et al., 2003). As in the case of literal language, semantic integration difﬁculty of metaphoric language is largely a function of contextual support (Pynte et al., 1996), and may also be attributable to demands of con- ceptual mapping and blending operations (Coulson & Van Petten, 2002). 2. RH Role in Metaphor Comprehension Results reviewed above thus suggest that qualitatively similar processing mechanisms underlie the comprehension of literal and metaphorical meanings. These, however, stand in opposition to the argument from neuropsychology that the right hemisphere (RH) is crucial for metaphor compre- hension. If metaphorical meanings can be construed as “residing” in the RH, metaphor could be considered pragmatic, extra-linguistic knowledge distinct from lit- eral language. Perhaps because of its theoret- ical implications, this issue has received by far the most attention from cognitive neuro- scientists. However, the exclusive association bet- ween RH damage and metaphor compre- hension deﬁcits is in fact rather equivocal. We review evidence both for (2.1.1) and against (2.1.2) the right hemisphere theory of metaphor from the study of patients with neurological deﬁcits. We follow with a dis- cussion of evidence from techniques used on healthy adults, such as rTMS (2.2), visual half-ﬁeld priming (2.3), and neuroimaging (2.4), all of which argue against the claim that the RH is the exclusive province of metaphoric meanings. 2.1 Patient Studies 2.1.1. EVIDENCE FOR THE RH THEORY The characterization of RHD patients as being overly literal in metaphor interpreta- tion originates in a study done by Winner and Gardner (1977) in which they asked RHD patients to match sentences such as “He had a heavy heart,” to a pictorial depiction from an array that included an illustration of the literal meaning of the phrase (a man lifting an oversized heart), the metaphoric mean- ing (a man crying), and different aspects of the literal meaning (a picture of a large weight, a picture of a heart). While RHD and LHD patients were both impaired rel- ative to healthy controls, the RHD patients were more likely to err by choosing the lit- eral foils, that is, the man stumbling under the weight of the massive heart. In a sim- ilar task, LHD aphasic patients were better able to match words such as wealth with con- notative pictorial representations, such as an arrow pointed up or down, than were RHD patients (Gardner & Denes, 1973). RHD patients have also been shown to have problems with metaphoric meanings in purely verbal paradigms. For example, Brownell and colleagues gave participants word triads, such as cold-hateful-warm, and asked them to pick the two words that had the same meaning, or that went together better (Brownell, 1984; Brownell, Simpson, Bihrle, Potter, & Gardner, 1990). Semantic relationships between the words were based on either denotative relationships, such as the antonymy between cold and warm, con- notative relationships, such as that between cold and foolish, metaphoric relationships as in cold and hateful, or were unrelated as in cold and wise. RHD patients showed nor- mal use of antonym association, but less than normal use of metaphoric equivalence;\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 183 LHD patients showed the opposite pattern (Brownell, 1984). Further, in a comparison of RHD and LHD patients’ language abilities, Van Lacker and Kemplar (1987) found that while both groups performed well in the comprehen- sion of single words, and RHD patients were better able to comprehend novel sen- tences, the LHD patients were better able to comprehend familiar idiomatic phrases. Given that LHD patients tend to have more obvious language deﬁcits than their RHD counterparts, the ﬁnding that LHD patients actually perform better than those with RHD on ﬁgurative language compre- hension tasks points toward a special role for the RH in ﬁgurative language compre- hension. An alternative explanation, however, is that the RHD deﬁcit lies in appreciat- ing the less frequent meaning of an am- biguous word, rather than the apprecia- tion of metaphoric meanings, per se. To address whether the RHD deﬁcit could be attributed to the appreciation of the less frequent meaning of an ambiguous word, Gagnon and colleagues tested metaphoric adjectives as well as non-metaphoric, but ambiguous, nouns (cf. Brownell et al., 1990). Relative to normal controls, both RHD and LHD patients’ performance was impaired. Although performance of both groups was comparable on the metaphoric adjectives, RHD patients outperformed the LHD patients on the non-metaphoric nouns (Gagnon, Goulet, Giroux, & Joanette, 2003). While the LHD patients’ deﬁcits argue against the idea that metaphor com- prehension is the exclusive province of the RH, these data suggest that metaphoric meanings pose a particular problem for RHD patients. 2.1.2. EVIDENCE AGAINST THE RH THEORY The original studies reporting impaired metaphor comprehension in RHD patients have been criticized for several methodolog- ical shortcomings (see e.g., (Joanette et al., 1990). For example, in their landmark “heavy heart” study, Winner and Gardner (1977) did not assess whether perceptual deﬁcits often associated with RHD affected patients’ task performance. Indeed, in many such stud- ies, perceptual deﬁcits are not assessed, and even the language abilities of the patients are not studied in detail (see Oliveri, Romero, & Papagno, 2004, for critique). The number of subjects is typically quite small, as is the number of stimuli. Further, because many of the studies that support the view of RHD metaphor comprehension deﬁcits have used forced choice paradigms, some researchers have suggested the RHD deﬁcit lies not in comprehension, per se, but in rejecting the alternative meanings of the experimental stimuli. RHD metaphor comprehension impair- ments are most evident in tasks that require controlled strategic processing. For example, Tompkins used an auditory word priming paradigm to test both automatic and con- trolled aspects of word processing (Tomp- kins, 1990). As is customary, this was achieved by varying the amount of time between the onset of the prime and the tar- get words (known as stimulus onset asyn- chrony, or SOA). When SOA is short, performance reﬂects fast-acting automatic processes; when SOA is longer, performance reﬂects slower controlled processes. At the short, but not the long, SOA, ambiguous primes facilitated performance for both lit- erally and metaphorically related targets, suggesting RHD patients can access the metaphoric meanings of words, but are impaired in the strategic use of seman- tic knowledge (Tompkins, 1990; Tompkins, Boada, & McGarry, 1992). These ﬁndings suggest that while both hemispheres are sen- sitive to word-level metaphoric meaning, task demands can impact performance due to limited attentional and memory resources in these patients. Working memory limitations may par- ticularly affect performance on picture matching as there is considerable evidence that these tasks underestimate patients’ metaphor comprehension abilities. A test of a large number of RHD participants’ metaphor comprehension abilities showed that although RHD patients were signiﬁ- cantly impaired on both a picture-matching\n184 SEANA COULSON and a verbal task, their impairment on the picture-matching task was more severe (Rinaldi, Marangolo, & Baldassarri, 2002). As in Winner and Gardner (1977), RHD par- ticipants were able to verbally explain the meaning of statements for which they had chosen the incorrect literal picture (Rinaldi et al., 2002). Other investigators have found that even neurologically intact participants perform better on verbal tests of ﬁgurative language comprehension than on tests that involve picture matching (Papagno, Tabossi, Colombo, & Zampetti, 2004). Further, in a test of both LHD and RHD patients, while LHD performance on verbal and pictorial subtests was correlated, RHD performance was not, suggesting non-linguistic factors may contribute to this dissociation (Zaidel, Kasher, Soroker, & Baroti, 2002). Indeed the ability to understand ﬁgu- rative language is compromised not only by unilateral lesions in the RH, but also by other neurological conditions. As noted above, both LHD and RHD individuals are impaired on tests of ﬁgurative language com- prehension (Gagnon et al., 2003; Papagno et al., 2004). Unlike their RHD counter- parts, LHD patients have been shown to be impaired both on picture matching tasks and on a task that requires them to give a ver- bal explanation of idiom meaning (Papagno et al., 2004). Giora and colleagues (Giora et al., 2002) found that RHD patients per- formed better than LHD patients on a test of the comprehension of highly conventional metaphors – though not on a test of sarcasm comprehension. Moreover, these investi- gators found that metaphor comprehen- sion was negatively correlated with lesion extent not in the right hemisphere, but, rather, in the left middle temporal gyrus and the area surrounding the left supramarginal and superior temporal gyri (also known as Wernicke’s area). Impaired idiom comprehension in the face of largely intact literal language com- prehension has also been observed in indi- viduals with conditions that compromise executive functions, such as Down’s syn- drome (Papagno & Vallar, 2001), and Alzheimer’s disease (Papagno, 2001). To address the relationship between execu- tive functions and idiom comprehension, Papagno, Lucchelli, Muggia, & Rizzo (2003) gave patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) a wide battery of tests that assessed their language abilities, executive function (via a dual task performance paradigm), and idiom comprehension using a picture match- ing task. As a group, AD patients per- formed similarly to healthy controls on the literal language tests, but worse than controls on the idiom task. Although lit- eral sentence comprehension scores were not correlated with performance on any other tests, idiom comprehension scores correlated with performance on the dual task. The detrimental effect of AD on central executive functions can negatively affect ﬁgurative language comprehension by impairing the ability to suppress literal meaning. In fact, the study of patients with agen- esis of the corpus callosum (ACC), has shown that metaphor comprehension can be impaired even in individuals with damage to neither side of the brain (Paul, Van Lancker- Sidtis, Schieffer, Dietrich, & Brown, 2003). In this condition, the corpus callosum, the ﬁber tract that connects the two hemi- spheres, does not develop, but brain mat- uration is otherwise relatively normal. In a study of a large sample of these patients with normal IQ stores, individuals with ACC performed normally on tests of literal lan- guage comprehension, but were impaired on tests of formulaic, non-literal language (Paul et al., 2003). Moreover, as in the idiom comprehension deﬁcits of RHD patients, the ACC patients tended to err by picking a lit- eral depiction of the idiomatic phrase. The similarity between performance of RHD patients and ACC patients with intact RHs indicates a crucial role for interhemispheric interaction in idiom comprehension. 2.2 Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Although the study of brain injured patients has been an invaluable source of informa- tion for cognitive neuroscientists, there are some inherent limitations to this method. Lesion size and location can vary drastically\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 185 among the members of a patient group, com- plicating inferences about the cause of any observed deﬁcits. People also differ in their degree of neural plasticity, or the extent to which the brain can “rewire” itself to com- pensate for the damaged tissue. Indeed, plas- ticity makes it difﬁcult to infer whether preserved language function reﬂects activ- ity in the reorganized brain, or the nor- mal ability of the spared tissue. However, these limitations are much less of a factor in rTMS. Used on neurologically intact adults, rTMS involves transmitting a series of mag- netic pulses to the scalp in order to disrupt the underlying brain activity. In these exper- iments, participants undergo stimulation to particular scalp regions (either with a real series of magnetic pulses, or a “sham” series), and subsequently perform a cognitive or language task. Although the disruption is transient and fully reversible, its effect on cognitive activity can be used to infer the importance of the affected brain area for the cognitive process being tested. rTMS allows the cognitive neuroscientist to test the effects of disrupting activity in a rela- tively small, targeted area of an otherwise normal brain. Oliveri and colleagues used rTMS to dis- rupt activity in right and left frontal and temporal brain areas while participants did a picture matching task (Oliveri et al., 2004). Sentences involved either opaque idioms (He is in shape) or literal controls (He is draw- ing). Pictures included either a depiction of the idiomatic interpretation (a picture of a man showing off his muscles) or a potential literal interpretation of the same sentence (a mouse embedded in a geometric wedge of cheese). Pictures for the literal sentences were either literal depictions of the sentence (a boy drawing), or an identical picture save one detail (a picture of a boy approaching a canvas). rTMS was applied over left and right temporal and frontal cortex. Left frontal rTMS induced a small but sig- niﬁcant impairment, but right frontal rTMS did not (Oliveri et al., 2004). Further, left temporal rTMS disrupted performance on both literal sentences and idioms, while right temporal rTMS actually facilitated perfor- mance on both idioms and literal sentences. This facilitation may result because homol- ogous LH areas were disinhibited, suggest- ing a critical role for left temporal areas in performance of this task. These studies sug- gest LH temporal lobe activity is critical for idiom comprehension. Thus neuropsy- chological studies that point to the impor- tance of the RH for idiom processing may instead reﬂect a generalized reduction in processing capacity (e.g., working memory and attentional resources). In the face of reduced resources, patients resort to strate- gies that result in their preference for literal depictions. 2.3 Visual Half-Field Priming Another technique that has been used to investigate the role of the right hemisphere in neurologically intact individuals is the visual half-ﬁeld priming paradigm. By pre- senting stimuli outside the center of gaze, it is possible to selectively stimulate visual cor- tex in the left or right hemisphere. In nor- mal individuals, the information is rapidly transmitted to other brain regions, including those in the other hemisphere. Nonetheless, differences in the initial stages of processing can indicate hemisphere-speciﬁc computa- tions (Chiarello, 1991). Presumably, because reading is primarily supported by LH activ- ity, lexical decision times (the amount of time it takes a participant to judge whether or not a string of letters forms a real word) are typically shorter with presentation to the right visual ﬁeld (RVF/LH). However, priming effects – the difference in response times to related and unrelated words – are sometimes larger with presentation to the left visual ﬁeld (LVF/RH), depending on the sorts of materials. Larger priming effects with RVF/LH presentation are typ- ically interpreted as indicating an LH bias for the materials, while larger LVF/RH priming effects indicate an RH bias. Research in the visual half-ﬁeld paradigm has suggested the two hemispheres play different, complementary roles in language processing (Beeman & Chiarello, 1998). Chiarello (1985), for example, has suggested that linguistic input results in automatic\n186 SEANA COULSON semantic activation in both hemispheres, but that only the LH engages in post-lexical inte- gration processes. Moreover, semantic acti- vations in the LH are more speciﬁc than in the RH, and subject to inhibitory pro- cesses (Chiarello, 1988). This portrait of focused semantic activation in the LH, and more disparate activations in the RH is sup- ported by a study of semantic paralexias pro- duced by normal participants when words were laterally presented (Rodel, Landis, & Regard, 1989). Further, whereas both hemi- spheres show priming for closely associ- ated words (sharp, knife, cut), the RH is more likely to show priming when the rela- tionship between words is more oblique (glass, foot, cut) (Beeman & Chiarello, 1998). Beeman and colleagues explicitly link RHD patients’ impaired performance on pragmatic language comprehension tasks such as metaphor comprehension to dif- ferences in semantic activations in the two hemispheres of the brain (Beeman et al., 1994). Alluding to hemispheric differences in the size of receptive ﬁelds in the visual system (Marsolek, Kosslyn, & Squire, 1992), Beeman and colleagues suggest semantic representations in the LH are ﬁne coded, while those in the RH are coarsely coded. These investigators speculate that while information activated by the LH is usu- ally adequate to connect discourse elements, information activated in the RH can be crucial for connecting elements that are distantly related. RHD patients’ deﬁcits in metaphor comprehension might result because the pertinent information is not activated in the RH. Similarly, Brownell suggests the RH contribution to metaphor comprehension is diffuse activation across a loosely organized semantic network that is not actively suppressed, and consequently can result in the formation of distant asso- ciations needed to understand metaphors (Brownell, 2000). Using the visual half-ﬁeld priming paradigm to examine hemispheric asym- metries in the processing of metaphoric language, Anaki and colleagues had par- ticipants read centrally presented words with literal and metaphoric meanings, and then make lexical decisions to laterally presented target words (Anaki, Faust, & Kravets, 1998). If the prime was stinging, for example, the target might be a word such as bee that related to the literal meaning of the prime, or a word such as insult that related to the prime’s metaphorical meaning. Target words appeared either, 200 ms after the onset of the prime, thought to index automatic processing, or 800 ms after the onset of the prime, thought to index later, more controlled, stages of processing. At the short SOA, both literal and metaphorical meanings were primed with presentation to the RVF/LH, and the metaphorical meaning was primed with presentation to the LVF/RH. At the longer SOA, Anaki and colleagues found priming for the literal meaning with presentation to the RVF/LH, and priming for the metaphorical meaning with presentation to the LVF/RH. These researchers have argued that their ﬁndings suggest metaphoric meanings are initially activated in both cerebral hemispheres, and subsequently decay rapidly in the LH, while being maintained in the RH. However, researchers using senten- tial stimuli found evidence that suggests metaphor comprehension involves both left and right hemisphere processing (Faust & Weisper, 2000). Faust and Weisper showed participants centrally presented sentence fragments such as “My job is a” followed by the lateralized presentation of a target word. Target words could make the sentence literally true, literally false, or metaphorically true. Participants were asked to judge the literal truth-value of the sentences – and thus respond “no” to the metaphoric endings. Results showed that regardless of which visual ﬁeld the target was presented to, a metaphor interference effect was observed. That is, “no” responses to metaphoric endings were slower and less accurate than those to the literally false endings, suggesting the metaphoric meaning was available in both hemispheres to produce response conﬂict. In fact, subsequent attempts to replicate results reported by Anaki and colleagues\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 187 have failed. Using English materials, Kacinik found literal (stinging BEE) and metaphor (stinging INSULT) priming with RVF/LH pre- sentation at short SOAs, but only literal priming with an 800 ms SOA; with LVF/RH presentation, literal priming was observed at SOAs of 100, 200, and 800 ms, while metaphor priming was evident only in accu- racy scores, suggesting the activation of the metaphoric meaning in the RH was weak, at best (Kacinik, 2003). When the adjective–noun pairs were pre- sented in sentence contexts, RVF/LH lit- eral and metaphor priming was observed after both ambiguous (Andrea obviously wasn’t aware of the icy SLOPE/GLARE) and unambiguous (I lost my balance on the icy SLOPE/GLARE vs. Ben turned his head only to see her icy GLARE/SLOPE) sentence primes (Kacinik, 2003). Similarly, with LVF/RH presentation, literal and metaphor priming was observed after both sorts of sentence primes, though priming effects were larger after the unambiguous sentences (Kacinik, 2003). These results suggest metaphoric meanings are available to both the LH and the RH (see also Kacinik & Chiarello, 2007). Kacinik also addressed hemispheric asym- metry in the processing of more complex sentential metaphors such as “The train I take to work is a bullet,” by testing for hemi- ﬁeld priming of probes related to the literal (KILLED) and metaphorical (FAST) meaning of the sentence ﬁnal noun (Kacinik, 2003). Probes (e.g., JAWS) were preceded either by a consistent sentence prime, (e.g., The life- guard thought he saw a shark), or an incon- sistent one (e.g., The lawyer they’ve hired is a shark). Priming was observed bilaterally for both literal and metaphorical meanings in con- sistent contexts. Inconsistent probes were never primed with RVF/LH presentation. Further, while inconsistent literal probes were primed in the LVF/RH, inconsis- tent metaphorical probes were not. Though these data support the idea that semantic activations in the RH are somewhat less sensitive to context than in the LH, they argue against the RH as the preferred sub- strate of metaphor comprehension. Indeed, recent work in the visual half-ﬁeld priming paradigm suggests both hemispheres have the capacity to comprehend metaphorical meanings. 2.4 Neuroimaging Perhaps the best-known technique for assessing the functional role of various brain regions in healthy people is neuroimaging. Imaging techniques such as positron emis- sion tomography (PET) and functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used to detect brain regions in which differ- ent experimental conditions are associated with increased metabolic activity. Though metaphor comprehension has received lit- tle attention from neuroimagers, one widely cited PET study of metaphor comprehen- sion supports the view of the RH as being preferentially involved in this aspect of lan- guage comprehension. In this study, participants judged whether literal sentences were plausible (The boy used stones as paperweights) or implausible (The lady has a bucket as a walking stick). In the metaphor condition, participants judged whether metaphors were interpretable (The old man had a head full of dead leaves), or uninterpretable (The investors were trams). Both literal and metaphorical sentences acti- vated LH areas in the prefrontal and basal frontal cortex, middle and inferior tempo- ral gyri, temporal pole, parietal cortex, and precuneus (Bottini et al., 1994), areas often activated by sentence comprehension tasks (Bookheimer, 2002). However, metaphor comprehension was also associated with increased RH activa- tion in the prefrontal cortex, the middle temporal gyrus, the precuneus, and the posterior cingulate (Bottini et al., 1994). Activations in the right precuneus have pre- viously been attributed to conscious inspec- tion of mental images, while prefrontal activation has been argued to reﬂect the difﬁculty of a decision task (Fletcher, Shal- lice, Frith, & Frackowiak, 1996). Bottini and colleagues argue that the prefrontal acti- vations reﬂect retrieval from episodic\n188 SEANA COULSON memory, and the precuneus activation reﬂects increased mental imagery associ- ated with metaphor comprehension. They speculate that these activations result because metaphor comprehension requires the retrieval of imageable experiences from episodic memory. In contrast, an event-related fMRI study revealed no evidence of preferential RH acti- vation to metaphor comprehension (Rapp, Leube, Erb, Grodd, & Kircher, 2004). Rapp and colleagues asked healthy adults to read simple metaphorical statements or literal statements with the same syntactic struc- ture. For example, the metaphor “The lovers’ words are harp sounds,” had the following lit- eral counterpart, “The lovers’ words are lies.” Participants’ task was to judge whether each sentence had a positive or negative connota- tion (matched across literal and metaphori- cal sentences). Relative to literal statements, metaphors activated left inferior frontal cor- tex, inferior temporal gyrus, and posterior middle temporal gyrus. No RH activation was observed. One difference between the PET study that revealed RH activation for metaphors and the fMRI study that did not is that task difﬁculty in the literal and metaphorical sen- tences was well-matched in the latter (Rapp et al., 2004) but not the former (Bottini et al., 1994). Consequently, RH recruitment may depend on overall task difﬁculty, rather than the ﬁgurativity of the meanings. Other fMRI studies in healthy adults indicate that when literal sentence comprehension places increased demands upon lexical and syntac- tic processes it results in increased activation both in classic LH language areas and in their RH homologues (Keller, Carpenter, & Just, 2001). In general, RH activation is associ- ated with complex sentences and discourse level processing (Bookheimer, 2002; Kircher, Brammer, Andreu, Williams, & McGuire, 2001; St. George, Kutas, Martinez, & Sereno, 1999), suggesting it is semantic complexity that triggers the recruitment of RH areas. RH activation in metaphor comprehension tasks, then, might not reﬂect the retrieval of metaphoric meanings from the RH. Rather, RH activations might simply result because the semantic complexity of metaphors is greater than that of their literal controls. 2.5 Summary Initially, the portrait of the RH as the preferred substrate of metaphor com- prehension looked quite compelling. On picture-matching tasks, RHD patients are more likely than their LHD counterparts to choose literal depictions of metaphoric idioms as the best representation of their meaning (Van Lancker & Kempler, 1987; Winner & Gardner, 1977). Further, on ver- bal tests, while RHD patients are able to understand multiple meanings of ambigu- ous nouns, they have difﬁculty access- ing the metaphoric meaning of adjectives (Brownell, 1984; Brownell et al., 1990; Gagnon et al., 2003). Visual half-ﬁeld stud- ies suggest that while metaphoric meanings are initially activated in both hemispheres, they are only sustained in the RH (Anaki et al., 1998). Finally, functional neuroimag- ing of healthy adults has revealed increased activation of RH brain areas during meta- phor comprehension (Bottini et al., 1994). However, in each case there is evi- dence against the RH metaphor proposal. Recent functional imaging results reveal that metaphor comprehension activates only LH language areas (Rapp et al., 2004). Visual half-ﬁeld studies suggest that when metaphors are embedded in sentence con- texts, both hemispheres have access to metaphoric meanings (Faust & Weisper, 2000; Kacinik, 2003). Both neuropsycholog- ical studies and rTMS research with nor- mals suggests that the crucial brain areas for metaphor comprehension are left temporal lobe areas crucial for normal comprehension of literal language (Giora et al., 2002; Oliveri et al., 2004). 3. The Neural Substrate of Metaphor Comprehension As we progress through the 21st century, it will be important to move beyond the\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 189 traditional question of the right hemi- sphere’s role in metaphor comprehension to address the particular cognitive and neu- ral underpinnings of this complex process. By combining information from the study of brain injured patients with behavioral, electrophysiological, and imaging data from healthy participants, it is possible to learn a great deal about the neural substrate of particular cognitive processes. In particular, research on the sensorimotor grounding of concepts and research on the neural instan- tiation of cross-domain mappings are areas of great promise in the study of metaphor. 3.1 Sensorimotor Grounding of Concepts An exciting development in neuroimag- ing research is the ﬁnding that the neu- ral substrate of action and perception is often exploited in higher cognitive activi- ties, including conceptualization that may be important for language comprehension. Sensory regions, for example, are active dur- ing sensory processing as well as during sen- sory imagery (Kosslyn, Thompson, Kim, & Alpert, 1995). Motor regions are active dur- ing the execution of action, but also during motor imagery, as well as during the percep- tion of the motor actions of others (Decety et al., 1997; Deiber et al., 1998; Jeannerod & Decety, 1995; Jeannerod & Frak, 1999). A series of studies suggest further that modality-speciﬁc areas become active in conceptual tasks, for example, color- processing regions (i.e., V4) are active for color concepts, motion processing areas (MT/MST) are active for conceptualizing motion, and shape (infero-temporal) versus motor (pre-motor cortex) processing regions for animals versus tools, respectively (Mar- tin, 2001; Martin & Chao, 2001). One issue for future research is whether modality- speciﬁc activation occurs in the comprehen- sion of metaphors. Reasoning on the basis of neural learning mechanisms, Pulverm¨uller and colleagues have long argued that the neural rep- resentation of word meaning must dif- fer as a function of our experience with what those words represent (Braitenberg & Pulvermuller, 1992; Pulverm¨uller, 1996, 1999). Hebbian learning, for example, is a mechanism by which connection strength between two neurons increases as a func- tion of correlated ﬁring. Because we might expect that words for objects would tend to co-occur with the visual experience of those objects, correlated ﬁring patterns between the neural representations of the wordforms and the associated visual experiences would result in the establishment of permanent connections between their neural substrates. Similarly, because words for actions would tend to co-occur with motor activity, simple Hebbian learning would result in connec- tions between activity in motor cortex and the neural representation of action words (Pulverm¨uller, 2003). Similarly, in the neural theory of lan- guage (NTL), it has been proposed that language comprehension involves simulat- ing the situation being described (Feldman & Narayanan, 2004). For example, the sim- ulation semantics of NTL suggests that cor- tical networks that subserve the action of grasping also serve as the neural substrate of the meaning of grasp. Because metaphor involves exploiting concepts from a con- crete domain to understand a more abstract one, this framework suggests that networks that subserve the action of grasping are also activated to understand the metaphorical meaning of grasp. Conceptual blending the- ory, which suggests that “grasping an idea” involves the parallel activation of an abstract and a concrete meaning of grasp, also makes this prediction (Coulson & Matlock, 2001). Recent ﬁndings suggest the represen- tation of word meaning extends beyond the classic language areas identiﬁed by neuropsychologists (Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio, 1996; Tranel, Logan, Frank, & Damasio, 1997), and raise the possibility that the neural substrate of metaphor comprehension depends on the particular source (vehicle) and target (topic) domains of the metaphor. In this framework, one would not expect metaphorical mean- ings to be processed in a single brain area, or even a particular network of brain areas. Rather, action metaphors would be expected\n190 SEANA COULSON to recruit brain areas underlying the compre- hension of action, while spatial metaphors would be expected to recruit brain areas that subserve spatial cognition. 3.2 Cross-Domain Mappings and the Mental Number Line The idea that conceptual knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor experience is closely related to the claim in cognitive lin- guistics that metaphoric understandings of abstract domains recruit concepts from more experientially basic ones (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000). One example for which there is some empirical support is that the abstract con- cept of numbers is understood by recruiting spatial concepts in the metaphor of numbers as points on a spatially extended line. Inher- ent in the concept of a number line, this metaphor posits a mapping or correspon- dence between particular numbers and par- ticular regions in space, such that quantity goes from left to right, with the largest num- bers mapping onto the right-most regions of the line. This predicts that neural structures that support spatial reasoning will be systemati- cally recruited in numerical operations, and that damage to brain structures involved in spatial reasoning will also have a detri- mental effect on numerical calculations that recruit the mental number line. In fact, neu- roimaging studies show that right intrapari- etal areas important for visuospatial pro- cessing are consistently activated by number comparison tasks (Chochon, Cohen, van de Moortele, & Dehaene, 1999; Pinel, Dehaene, Rivi`ere, & Le Bihan, 2001). Further, the pre- diction that damage to the underlying sub- strate of visuospatial processing is borne out by the fact that hemineglect impacts various arithmetic tasks. Hemineglect is a neurological condition resulting from lesions to the RH parietal lobe in which the patient has difﬁculty attending to objects on the left side of space. Consis- tent with a mapping between numbers and regions of space, hemineglect patients have been shown to be impaired when making judgments about numbers to the left of a reference number on a linear number line. For example, when asked to judge whether numeric stimuli were greater or less than 5, patients with neglect were slower to respond to 4 than to 6; when asked to judge whether numeric stimuli were greater or less than 7, patients with neglect were slower to respond to 6 than 8 (Vuilleumier, Ortigue, & Brugger, 2004). Another task on which hemineglect is apparent is line bisection, in which the par- ticipant is asked to mark the midpoint of a line. Patients with neglect tend to place their marks slightly to the right of the midline – presumably because they are unaware of the left-most portion of the line (Bisiach & Vallar, 2000). Zorzi and colleagues tested RHD patients with and without hemine- glect on a variety of arithmetic tasks (Zorzi, Priftis, & Umilta, 2002). All patients scored well on tests of subtraction and number comparison. However, only the hemineglect patients were impaired on a test on which they had to estimate the midpoint of two numbers. They tended to pick a number that was higher than the correct answer – anal- ogous to a mark to the right of the midline on the line bisection task. These analogous patterns of deﬁcits on the spatial and arith- metic problems points to the neurological reality of a metaphorical mapping between numbers and points on a spatially extended line ordered from left to right. This mapping is further supported by evi- dence that experimental manipulations that affect the direction of attention in space affect performance on the midpoint esti- mation task. Rossetti and colleagues (2004) tested for the cognitive consequences of prism adaptation by having patients with hemineglect perform the midpoint estima- tion task before and after a session in which they wore prism glasses that shift the visual world by 10 degrees. In addition to the actual prism adaptation session, patients also underwent a sham adaptation period in which they wore goggles that had no effect on the visual world. Performance on number bisection was not impacted by wearing the sham goggles, but was reliably improved after prism adaptation, suggesting\nMETAPHOR COMPREHENSION AND THE BRAIN 191 a functional link between parietal regions involved in the representation of space and numbers (Rossetti et al., 2004). 3.3 Conclusions Overall, the investigation of the neurolog- ical substrate of metaphor comprehension has proceeded at a rather coarse level, and addressed only the most basic of issues. Indeed, most research on this topic treats metaphoric language as a single monolithic category. Metaphors and idioms are fre- quently lumped together into one undif- ferentiated category (see Gagnon et al., 2003; Oliveri et al., 2004, for critique). Fur- ther, though there are a number of reasons to expect differences in the processing of highly conventional, lexicalized, metaphors and more novel ones Giora, 1997; Giora et al., 2002, this difference has not been thor- oughly tested with the methods of cogni- tive neuroscience. Similarly, among novel metaphors there has been no investigation of the impact of conformity to conceptual metaphors, abstract patterns of metaphoric mapping such as that between progress and motion along a path, or love relation- ships and journeys (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999; Lakoff & Turner, 1989). However, research on how the neural substrate of perception and action can be co-opted by higher-level processes suggests new avenues for research. Rather than con- trasting literal and metaphorical meanings, future researchers may investigate differ- ences between visual, auditory, and kines- thetic metaphors. Though the mental num- ber line may seem a far cry from the so-called dream work of language, the under- lying mechanism of cross-domain mappings may ultimately help us to understand how abstract concepts can emerge in brains that evolved to propel the body through the physical, social, and cultural world.

(Paul Klee) When people talk to each other, they make widespread use of metaphor. In talk, metaphor is a shifting, dynamic phe- nomenon that spreads, connects, and dis- connects with other thoughts and other speakers, starts and restarts, ﬂows through talk developing, extending, changing. Meta- phor in talk both shapes the ongoing talk and is shaped by it. The creativity of metaphor in talk appears less in the novelty of con- nected domains and more in the use of metaphor to shape a discourse event and in the adaptation of metaphor in the ﬂow of talk. Metaphor in talk is not evenly spread but gathers in clusters and occa- sionally, and then signiﬁcantly, is altogether absent. People use metaphor to think with, to explain themselves to others, to organ- ise their talk, and their choice of metaphor often reveals – not only their conceptualisa- tions – but also, and perhaps more impor- tantly for human communication, their atti- tudes and values. Beginning with speciﬁc instances of metaphor in talk, and under- standing how people use metaphor, will help us construct better hypotheses about the nature of metaphor. This chapter reviews features of metaphor use that have been found in a range of types of spoken discourse. The ﬁrst major section focuses on the ‘shape’ of metaphor in talk: its density and distribution, form and systematicity, conventionality and signalling. The second section describes how people use metaphor in processes of human social interaction: how metaphor carries attitudes and values, how metaphor is used in the management of talk and in the negotiation of ideas and understandings. The third section considers the connection between metaphor in talk and conceptual metaphor. Methodological issues in researching metaphor in talk are discussed in each section, with some concluding thoughts on a future research agenda. 197\n198 LYNNE CAMERON The ‘Shape’ of Metaphor in Talk Metaphor in talk is dynamic. In even short stretches of talk, we can see metaphor in ﬂux as speakers adjust and adapt to what the other says. When metaphor is examined over longer stretches of talk, regularities and sta- bilities in the dynamics of metaphor emerge, and it is these features that are described in this section. The ﬁrst extract of talk is between two people engaged in post-conﬂict recon- ciliation.1 Pat Magee was a political acti- vist in Ireland, and nearly 20 years earlier planted a bomb that killed Jo Berry’s father. They have come together at Jo’s request so that she can construct some understanding of Pat’s motivation. Extract 1 comes from near the start of their second meeting at a point where they are exploring their respec- tive reasons for talking to each other. Pat asks Jo whether she expected their meet- ings to lead to her understanding him as an individual person or as a member of a movement that was engaged in a polit- ical struggle. In her response, Jo explains how the personal and the political came together for her on the day of the bombing. (Micro-pauses are marked with dots inside brackets.) Extract 1 Reconciliation talk 1 Pat: I suppose there’s a question that comes to my mind from that er I don’t (.) think we’ve covered before (.) er did you see it as like individuals 5 or did you see it as a sort of (.) big polit- ical picture the IRA or the war you know what I mean er you were you were aware that there’s a 10 er it was going to be an individual who you’d be sitting down with Jo: I saw it as both as er when 15 (. . .) on that day it was like suddenly I was thrown into the conﬂict it was suddenly my conﬂict it was suddenly my conﬂict and it felt like my heart was broken 20 through the conﬂict and (.) the suffering was my suffering I couldn’t separate it I couldn’t be detached anymore and that that er 25 that pain that loss was shared by (.) everyone and you know and after that (.) the pain on every side you know I felt it 30 and I wanted to understand (. . .) the politics of it In this talk, the ‘speciﬁc instances’ that are of interest are linguistic metaphors, indi- cated by underlining in Extract 1. Linguis- tic metaphors are expressions in language that have the potential to be understood metaphorically. Context, preceding and sub- sequent utterances may offer evidence of speakers’ intentions or interpretations, but this evidence is not required for metaphor identiﬁcation. Linguistic metaphor is iden- tiﬁed through the use of words or phrases that potentially link to a vehicle (or source) domain which is distinct from the domain of the surrounding, ongoing talk (the topic or target). An alternative to domain differ- ence as criterion for linguistic metaphor is the use of words and phrases with some meaning other than their basic or core sense, where basic is primarily physical and concrete. How Much Metaphor Is Used in Talk? The ﬁrst question that might be asked about metaphor in talk is how frequently it is used. Anyone who has tried to answer such a ques- tion will know that it is far from straight- forward. Consider Extract 1, which lasts for about 50 seconds, from a 50-minute conver- sation. If we are to calculate the frequency of metaphor use in the extract, we need some measure of the number of metaphors per unit of time. The 16 metaphor vehicles are likely to include several controversial decisions, while there may well be other lexical items that some researchers would want included as metaphorical. For example, the inclusion\nMETAPHOR AND TALK 199 of through (line 20) as metaphorical relies on a series of decisions: ﬁrst, to include prepositions and second, to distinguish a physical sense of through that might be said to be metaphorically invoked in talk- ing about conﬂict (Cameron, 2003, p. 73). For some people, felt in line 30 might war- rant being considered metaphorical, since it could be argued that there is a basic physical sense of feeling which is distinct from the emotional and cognitive sense implied here. How researchers deﬁne and identify ‘metaphor’ can vary enormously. What is more, borderline cases often involve very frequent lexical items and so decisions about inclusion or exclusion can make con- siderable differences to the overall num- ber of metaphors identiﬁed. I have writ- ten elsewhere and at length about the dif- ﬁculties involved in putting boundaries on a fuzzy category like metaphor, with its many graded dimensions (Cameron, 1999, 2003). The solution lies in explicit state- ments about the identiﬁcation procedure, especially boundary decisions, that will enable other researchers to replicate the method. A meta-analysis of ﬁgures reported for the number of linguistic metaphors used in talk of different types showed that metaphor density ranges from around 20 metaphors per 1,000 words for college lectures to around 50 in ‘ordinary discourse’ and 60 in teacher talk (Cameron, 2003, p. 57). In order to compare ﬁgures, assumptions had to be made about relations between the various units chosen by researchers to represent time. Most researchers do not in fact use temporal units, but textual units of transcribed talk, that is sentences, turns, or words. Textual units are in some ways more helpful since they allow comparison with metaphor density in written discourse, but they vary in how valid they are as temporal equivalents. A candidate for a standard unit of tran- scription for spoken interaction that, being both linguistic and cognitive, may better suit metaphor research than the turn, is the into- nation unit, as developed by Chafe (Chafe, 1996). The intonation unit aims to be a unit of language and thought in which a single ‘idea’ is voiced in a single intonation con- tour. Accurate transcription of full and trun- cated intonation units requires training and practice, and reliability checking (Stelma & Cameron, 2007). Once training is com- pleted, the researcher has a unit that offers possibilities for analysing the interaction of talking and thinking. Over a considerable amount of transcribed data, the intonation unit also turns out to be fairly stable as a temporal unit, of nearly 2 seconds (Cameron & Stelma, 2004). Precise reporting of deci- sions made about categories and units is needed for replicability and for reliable or valid comparisons across studies. Without this, we will be unable to build reliable knowledge of how people use metaphor in talk. To calculate metaphor density, we divide the number of linguistic metaphors by the number of words in the transcription, after removal of non-talk features such as pause markings and speaker names. When calcu- lated as the number of metaphor vehicles per 1,000 words, metaphor density presents in sensibly sized numbers. The metaphor density of Extract 1 comes out at 100.6 metaphors per 1000 words, which happens to coincide with the overall ﬁgure for the conversations. Across three types of spoken discourse that I have so far examined using the same methods of identiﬁcation and mea- surement, there is considerable variation in metaphor density. In comparison with the high metaphor density of reconciliation talk at about 100 metaphors per 1,000 words, a doctor–patient interview used around half as many metaphors, with a density of 55 metaphors per 1,000 words. Classroom talk had the lowest metaphor density but this also varied with the type of discourse event or lesson. Overall density was around 27 metaphors per 1,000 words, with the highest density of over 40 in a lesson on apostrophes and the lowest of under 15 in a mathematics lesson. To understand why speakers in different discourse contexts make differential use of metaphor, we need more qualitative, discourse-analytic, studies\n200 LYNNE CAMERON of talk such as those reviewed later in this chapter. The Distribution of Metaphors in Talk When we plot the occurrence of metaphors minute by minute across a discourse event, we ﬁnd that they are not evenly distributed but tend to cluster at certain points in the talk. This tendency has been noted in psychotherapeutic talk (Pollio & Barlow, 1975), college lectures (Corts & Pollio, 1999), classroom talk (Cameron, 2003), sermons (Corts & Meyers, 2002), and is also a feature of some written texts (Koller, 2003; Low, 1997). Recent work has also found the con- verse, that there may be phases of talk in which metaphor is nearly absent (Cameron & Stelma, 2004); this is further discussed later in the chapter. Clustering (or bursts, as Corts and col- leagues call them) of metaphors occur on both micro and macro scales of talk. As hap- pens in Extract 1, it is common in talk for metaphors to be used in groups of three or more (lines 1–6; 15–20; 22–28), and rare for a single, isolated metaphor to occur. Clustering also occurs on a scale of min- utes, compared with the seconds covered by three or four intonation units, and, in the studies described previously, often mark points in talk where something complex or unfamiliar needs to be explained or inter- preted. Part of the reason for clustering is thus topical; explanations of a topic that requires the use of metaphor are likely to produce multiple instances of the same and connected metaphors. It seems likely that processing factors also contribute to clus- tering. Like any lexical item, metaphors are subject to the repetition and reformu- lation that characterise spontaneous talk (McCarthy, 1988). Furthermore, when one speaker uses metaphor, other speakers seem more likely to adapt their own talk and become metaphorical in response. The Grammar of Metaphor in Talk The form of linguistic metaphors in a par- ticular language depends on the affordances offered by its vocabulary and grammar. Metaphors in English make particular use of: r verbs: 63% of the linguistic metaphors in my educational data were verbs or verb phrases, compared to 22% for nom- inal metaphors. This tendency is repli- cated in my other data sets and is clearly evidenced in the extracts in this chap- ter. Brooke-Rose (1958) reported a similar phenomenon in her study of poetry. r delexicalised verbs and prepositions, often in combination, for example now go back to your memory ( = think about it again) r noun phrase formulations such as ‘the xxx of yyy’, for example the blanket of gases; the overall picture of the age r adjective + noun for condensing compar- isons into metaphors, for example trees like little lollipops →lollipop trees. The tendency for English to place metaphoricity in the verb merits more attention than it has been given, since it has implications for what we take to be the very nature of metaphor. There is considerable evidence from a range of sources that nouns and verbs play different roles in language use. Sapir (1921) claimed that every language expresses a distinction between what is being talked about, usually a person or object, and what is said about that subject, usually an action or outcome of an action. The “universal lexicalisation of the prototypical discourse functions” (Hopper & Thompson, 1984, p. 703) leads to what are termed nouns and verbs. The process is replicated ontogenetically as nouns emerge from early labels for concrete objects and verbs from early labels for speciﬁc actions in ﬁrst language acquisition (Brown, 1958). Cross-linguistically, nouns function referentially and are reliably acquired early and rapidly. Verbs, on the other hand, show more cross-linguistic variation. They express relations between objects or people and seem to encode slightly different conceptual relationships in different languages (Gentner, 1982, p. 325). Early vocabulary acquisition typically shows a small number of verbs that are used in a\nMETAPHOR AND TALK 201 range of communicative contexts (Gentner, 1978). This early ﬂexibility of the verb contin- ues (Hopper, 1997). Brooke-Rose noted the ability of verbs to shift their meaning slightly depending on their collocated nouns, and suggested that the easy extension of a verb’s meaning when used with many different nouns might lead to an originally metaphoric use becoming much less striking (Brooke- Rose, 1958). The ease with which verbs can extend their meaning may also explain why verbalisation occurs less frequently than nominalisation in morphological conversion (Hopper & Thompson, 1984). In English, the two processes of nominalisation (a verb becomes a noun) and verbalisation (a noun becomes a verb) are asymmetric. Nominal- isation of events is frequent and carried out through a range of afﬁxes including -ion, -ing, -ment. The converse process of creating new verbs from nouns is less frequent and is conceptually loosening, in the sense that it creates an event or action that has links with an entity. Consider the examples: he burrowed through the crowd (from Hopper & Thompson, 1984) the computer calendarises the data (author’s data) I video-ed the programme they are being short-cutted In each case, the new verb has a connec- tion with the original noun (burrow, calen- dar, video, short cut) but these connections are of very different sorts. There are impli- cations here for metaphor, in that identify- ing a verbalisation like burrowed as a linguis- tic metaphor requires there to be sufﬁcient connection to the original noun to warrant a claim of cross-domain mapping. Corpus studies of metaphor suggest that the process of conventionalisation involves a stabilising of lexico-grammatical form. For example, the word shoulder appears in metaphors either as a verb (always meta- phorical) or in a small number of nomi- nal phrases such as cold shoulder (Deignan, 1999). A person’s knowledge of conven- tionalised metaphors will thus be likely to include knowledge about form, which can be used to assist processing and interpreta- tion. The ﬂexibility of verbs in use contributes to the difﬁculty that researchers face when identifying verb metaphors. Decisions about verbs need to consider both the verb and its conventional collocates, since the meaning of a verb inheres in its use with these, rather than in its referential uses as with nouns. Implicit Topics The verbal nature of many linguistic metaphors connects with the frequent absence of explicit metaphor topics. In Ex- tract 1, metaphor vehicles such as see, thrown into, separate are used without explicit refer- ence in the topic domain; the other speaker has to make sense of the inferred mean- ing from the context of the ongoing dis- course. The need to infer metaphor topics seldom seems to create a major problem for shared understanding, but it does open up the possibility for differences in under- standing between one speaker and another. The lack of an explicit topic also creates an opportunity for more signiﬁcant or inten- tional shifts in meaning when a speaker shifts the use or interpretation of a vehicle term. In a later section, we see how the appro- priation of one speaker’s metaphor vehicle by the other can help achieve interactional purposes. In educational discourse, lack of knowledge of the topic domain may lead stu- dents to misinterpret the intended reference of a metaphor vehicle (Cameron, 2003). Vehicle Development and the Systematicity of Linguistic Metaphor The metaphor vehicles include two lexi- cal chains across Extract 1 (line numbers in brackets): see (4) – see (5) – picture (6) – saw (12) broken (19) – separate (22) – detached (23) – loss (25) – shared by (25) – on every side (28) These connected vehicle terms create the systematicity of metaphor which is found locally in speciﬁc discourse events and,\n202 LYNNE CAMERON more globally, across discourse communi- ties (Cameron, 1999). It is, of course, the systematicity of linguistic metaphor that underpins many of the claims of cogni- tive metaphor theory, in which globally sys- tematic metaphors are labelled ‘conceptual metaphors’. At the more local level of the extract, systematicity is created by several modes of ‘vehicle development’ (Cameron, 2003, p. 165; 2008). The vehicle see is repeated, verbatim and with change of tense, while the vehicle separate is relexicalised as detached. Repetition and relexicalisation of metaphor vehicles parallels what happens with other lexis in spontaneous talk (McCarthy, 1988). A third mechanism of vehicle development is Jo’s explication of separation through elab- oration of the idea of the coming together of the personal and the political, from line 20 on. Vehicle development is the basis for cre- ativity and play with metaphor in talk, through novel relexicalisations or expan- sions (Carter, 2004). In the following extract, a student picks up a teacher’s throw- away comment by extending the vehicle of her metaphor about time. The teacher recip- rocates by adding to the vehicle develop- ment in the last line with quickly. Extract 2 Student play with teacher’s metaphor (from Cameron, 2003, p. 141) Teacher: (to the class) where does the time go? (some minutes later) yes Paul? Paul: I know where the times goes (1.0) into the past Teacher: into the past (.) you’re right quickly into the past As we will see in the rest of this chapter, vehicle development and metaphor shifting underlie many of the phenomena observed in metaphor use in talk. Conventionalized and Deliberate Linguistic Metaphors The two vehicle domains of seeing and of separation illustrate another dimension of metaphor: the degree to which a metaphor is conventionalised within the discourse com- munity. Conventionalisation is a dynamic process that takes place within the talk of a discourse community and from which emerges a metaphor that can act as com- mon currency in future talk. In talk between a particular teacher and group of children in my data, the phrase lollipop trees emerged as a way of describing over-simple pictures in which trees were drawn as a circle on top of a stick (Cameron, 2003, p. 117). The metaphor UNDERSTANDING IS SEE- ING is conventionalised, not just in this particular discourse community but across many, and is likely to be automatically used and understood by speakers. In comparison, the metaphors of separation and bringing together of the personal and political, and of shared pain, found in Extract 1, appear to be constructed on the spot by Jo as she tries to explain herself to Pat. The metaphors that she constructs are not particularly novel, the usual contrast with conventional, but they are deliberate, meaning that the speaker searches for what she or he con- siders an appropriate way of expressing an idea. The result of the search is a linguis- tic metaphor. I suggest that for metaphor in talk, it is useful to think of deliberate metaphors in contrast to conventionalised metaphors. Novel metaphors – which seem to occur quite rarely in spontaneous talk – are deliberate, since some kind of search for an appropriate expression must have pre- ceded production. In my classroom data, deliberate metaphors account for about 10% of the linguistic metaphors, are likely to be nominal rather than verbal, and to be sig- nalled in some way. Tuning of Linguistic Metaphors Signals of deliberate metaphors may include pausing, hesitation, and the use of ‘tuning devices’. The metaphor of the big political picture in lines 5–6 is a deliberate metaphor signalled by the phrase a sort of. In a corpus- based study of such words and phrases, we found that sort of and kind of are widely used in front of metaphors, often in combination\nMETAPHOR AND TALK 203 with each other and with like (Cameron & Deignan, 2003). We suggested that such phrases act as ‘tuning devices’ to help speak- ers activate metaphorical interpretation in on-line talk. What appears to govern the use of tuning devices is a speaker’s judge- ment about the ‘expectedness’ of a particu- lar metaphor in the speciﬁc discourse con- text (Cameron & Deignan, 2003, p. 158). They may direct listeners to one of several possible interpretations, preventing inappro- priate literal interpretation, or indicate the nature of the mapping between topic and vehicle. Tuning devices can also tone down or mitigate the interpretation of a metaphor, that, without the device, might come across as overly strong (compare it was like sud- denly I was thrown into the conﬂict, line 16, with suddenly I was thrown into the conﬂict) or face-threatening. Tuning devices are used across genres and contexts of talk, as one of several ways in which speakers reduce the risk of ambigu- ity that is, in theory but seldom in prac- tice, associated with using metaphor. They serve as an example of how metaphor in talk is shaped by the pressures and possi- bilities of human interaction, and it is to these pressures and possibilities that we turn next. How People Use Metaphor in Talk In understanding the discourse roles and functions of metaphor, researchers combine analysis of metaphor use with various meth- ods of discourse analysis, including conver- sation analysis, functional analysis and nar- rative theory. In this section, I describe how metaphor has been found to work in the affective dimension of human interaction, how it helps in discourse management, and how it can be used to construct discourse spaces in which speakers can negotiate new understandings. The Affective Impact of Metaphor When speakers bring a new vehicle domain into their talk through the use of metaphor, they have the potential to adjust the seman- tic prosody of the ongoing discourse (Louw, 1993). Metaphors carry not only ideational content but also something of speakers’ atti- tudes and values in respect of that con- tent. Vehicle choice offers affective poten- tial. Three dimensions of affect help to analyse how speakers’ choices of metaphor vehicles contribute to the affective work of metaphor: alignment–distancing; positive– negative evaluation; emphasis–de-emphasis (Graumann, 1990). When the topic of talk is uncomfortable for speakers in some way, metaphor helps to distance and de- emphasise. Comparing the use of metaphor with its absence shows how this distancing works. Absence of metaphor is not much men- tioned in the literature but was a signiﬁ- cant feature of reconciliation talk (Cameron & Stelma, 2004). Stretches of talk with- out metaphor were of two sorts. Talk about travel or meeting arrangements had no need of metaphor because content was literal and physical. The more interesting metaphor- free episodes were narrative accounts of extremely painful events. In a particularly key episode, Jo Berry, who we saw in Extract 1, describes her daughter asking if she could come to meet the bomber: Extract 3 Jo tells Pat what her daughter said 1 Jo . . . (1.0) before I . . . left this morning, I decided to tell my children, . . . that I was gonna meet you. Pat hmh 5 Jo . . . (1.0) and I told my seven year old. Pat yeah Jo . . . and she said, I want to come. . . . I want to tell him, 10 . . . that was a bad thing he did, to kill my mum’s daddy. Pat hmh Jo I want to tell him, Pat hmh 15 Jo . . . can I come? she said, and I said, well no, . . . but you can write it down, 20 or I’ll tell him,\n204 LYNNE CAMERON . . . no. she said, I must come and tell him. Pat hmh The use of the child’s words and simple syn- tax in lines 8–23 makes for a striking stretch of talk, that clearly affects Pat, who refers to it several weeks and again several years later. By using reported speech, Jo presents the human consequences of his political action to Pat in an abrupt and raw manner, to kill my mummy’s daddy, without the distancing effect of metaphor. Pat himself sometimes talks without metaphors, again creating raw and high- impact narratives, for example, about being imprisoned and beaten by the army. Such bare, direct talk, marked by an absence of metaphors, is rare; it seems that, although it creates a strong impact on the listener, it is probably too painful to say or to listen to more than rarely (Kirmayer, 2004). More often, as with loss or separation in Extract 1, metaphor helps speakers by enabling emo- tionally difﬁcult topics to be talked about indirectly. Metaphor and the Management of Talk Extract 1 begins with Pat doing some dis- course management in lines 1–4, as he intro- duces the new topic of the personal and the political. Metaphor plays several important roles in the management of talk. Firstly, it is used in talk to describe the process of the talk: a question that comes to my mind (a question that) . . . we’ve covered before and in doctor–patient talk: let me just say something and put it on the table and then we can think about this ok let me go back one step In classroom talk, metaphors are frequently used in ‘agenda management’ at the begin- ning and end of lessons and tasks (Cameron, 2003). At this point in a lesson or task, the teacher summarises upcoming activity in terms of both content and procedure. In addition, however, agenda management metaphors often served affective purposes as well as transactional ones. In Extract 4, the teacher not only tells students what they are going to study but also frames this activity so that it does not seem too onerous. (Note: intonation units were not used in this tran- scription. Longer pauses are shown in brack- ets with time to the nearest second) Extract 4 Opening a lesson on rocks (from Cameron, 2003, p. 127) 1 Teacher: now what I’m going to do (.) this afternoon (1.0) because I can’t think of any other way to do it (1.0) 5 is to give you a little bit of information (2.0) on which we can build (.) our under- standing (1.0) of (.) rocks (4.0) and the minerals that come out of 10 rocks (1.0) and also (.) how rocks weather (2.0) in other words (.) what happens to rocks (1.0) when (.) the snow (.) and the wind 15 and the ice and the rain and the tem- perature (1.0) acts upon them so there are really two things we’re going to look at (2.0) this half term (1.0) 20 one is how rocks weather (1.0) and the other is (.) about the min- erals (.) that are in them (.) that we can use In terms of content, the geological activity is talked about using personiﬁcation or at least animacy, a common technique in expla- nations of scientiﬁc concepts (Cameron & Low, 2004): come out of; acts upon. In terms of procedures, teaching the quite difﬁcult geological concepts set out in lines 20–24 is metaphorically referred to as give a little bit of information (line 5), and later (in line 18) as look at. In doing agenda management, the teacher uses metaphor to align herself with the students in the learning process (also through the use of we with the metaphor build on in line 7), and chooses metaphors that emphasise the ease of the process rather\nMETAPHOR AND TALK 205 than its possible difﬁculties. Metaphors in agenda management help teachers not only to summarise content but also to moti- vate and engage students in the learning process. A combined ideational and affective role for metaphors in discourse manage- ment is also found in non-classroom talk. Metaphors, and in particular metaphorical idioms, are used by speakers in spontaneous informal conversations at points of topic transition as a way of simultaneously sum- marising content, expressing an opinion, and closing the topic (Drew & Holt, 1988, 1995, 1998). Extract 5 is taken from Drew and Holt’s collection of telephone conversations, and shows Leslie (L) telling her mother (M) about the death of someone they both knew. The metaphorical idiom occurs in line 17: he had a good innings (a cricketing metaphor meaning a long life). Extract 5 Completing a topic with a metaphorical idiom (from Drew and Holt, 1995, p. 121, with some changes to the origi- nal transcription) 1 L: he was the vicar’s ward n anyway he died suddenly this week and he was still working (0.3) 5 M: good gracious L: he was seventy nine M: my word? (.) L: yes he was um M: you’ve got some real workers down 10 there heh L: he was a p yes indeed he was a buyer for the only horsehair factory left in England 15 M: good gracious L: and he was their buyer (.) so he had a good innings didn’t he? M: I should say so. yes (.) 20 marvellous L: anyway we had a very good evening on Saturday The metaphor had a good innings does sev- eral discourse management tasks. It sum- marises the topic of the old man’s life and death, with a positive evaluation. In lines 18–20, the mother accepts this summary by agreeing with her daughter, and the daugh- ter then opens the new topic of Saturday evening. The summary clears the way for topic transition, not just in terms of con- tent but also affectively, by providing a ‘space’ in which both speakers can agree and align. Metaphor as Offering a Shared Discourse Space Drew and Holt’s suggestion that metaphor- ical idioms offer speakers a neutral ‘third space’ outside of the conversation where they can align and agree (Drew & Holt, 1988) suggests a powerful way of understanding how deliberate linguistic metaphors can con- tribute to the dynamics of talk and think- ing, beyond the mechanics of topic transi- tion. In psychotherapeutic talk, for example, the therapist may deliberately shift to a new generative metaphor and offer it to the client as a way of thinking about the problem under discussion. Extending the metaphor through vehicle development can build a third, metaphorical, space in which therapist and client can discuss very painful topics in a more neutral or less negative way, returning later to the real world, in hopes of bring- ing new understandings generated by the metaphorical talk (Evans, 2003). Research into the use of metaphor by seriously ill people shows that generative metaphors are used, with and without mediation by oth- ers, to conceptualise experience and adjust behaviour (Gibbs & Franks, 2002; Gwyn, 1999). The idea of a metaphorically con- structed third space can be applied to the reconciliation talk. Here metaphor offers speakers, coming from very disparate stand- points, a place in which to align or to nego- tiate towards deeper understanding of the other. Negotiating and Appropriating Metaphors in Talk There are many instances, as with see in Extract 1, where conventionalised meta- phors used by one speaker are repeated or\n206 LYNNE CAMERON developed by the other in a subsequent turn. However, sometimes a speaker adopts the other’s metaphor over a longer period of talk, in a move that is signiﬁcant for increased alignment and understanding, and that exploits the opportunities of non- explicit topic and vehicle shifting. This hap- pened with the gradual appropriation of healing, a metaphor ﬁrst used by Jo in a poem she read aloud to Pat to describe recovering from her father’s death in the bombing and on a wider scale: the heat heals the pain . . . for the healing of the world . . . I feel that my heart heals As Ireland heals In responding to the poem, Pat picks up this metaphor and uses it to refer to helping other victims: move on in their own healing process Later in the same discourse event, when Pat is talking about his feelings, he uses the heal- ing metaphor for the ﬁrst time in reference to himself, with much hesitation, pausing, and rhetorical questions all suggesting some difﬁdence or unease at doing so: how do you put it? . . . maybe that’s part of healing too my healing After this point, the healing metaphor is used in the talk to refer to both Jo’s recovering from grief and Pat’s working through the consequences of his actions. We can see how metaphor offers affordances in spoken inter- action for participants to shift their align- ment and their meanings: the affective force of healing is intrinsically positive; in using it to refer to recovering from grief as Jo does, Pat aligns himself with her; in tenta- tively appropriating it to describe his own process of accepting responsibility, he moves even closer by placing their two processes in the same vehicle space. By extending and shifting the topic reference of the vehicle term healing, the metaphor offers an expres- sion that can be shared, a discourse space where the distance between participants is reduced. The property of a metaphor vehicle to be applied to different Topics has been labelled ‘multivalency’ (Goatly, 1997, p. 255). The action of employing a previously used vehi- cle with a new topic can be called ‘vehi- cle re-deployment’, and appropriation of another’s metaphor is one possible out- come of vehicle re-deployment (Cameron, 2008). Metaphors offered by one speaker can also be directly challenged, although this does not seem to happen very often. In one instance in the reconciliation talk, Jo describes the reconciliation process as building a bridge. Pat uses this metaphor but adjusts the vehicle slightly, suggest- ing that he is not ready to agree com- pletely with Jo’s perspective, and that their disparate starting points still need to be acknowledged: in the journey . . . coming to a bridge . . . with two ends Negotiating Technical Language through Metaphor An important ideational role of metaphor in talk is making accessible the techni- cal language of specialist groups to non- experts. Although technical language makes use of metaphor, greater use of metaphor is observed when experts from a group are required to talk with non-experts, as when a teacher talks to students or a doctor talks to a patient. In this kind of situation, techni- cal ideas are mediated through language that is somewhere between everyday talk and the technical language. This mediating talk makes heavy use of ‘sub-technical metaphor’ (Cameron, 2003, p. 112). We can see an example in the next extract, where a doctor is explaining to a patient how her urinary problem will be treated. He explains the cognitive behavioural therapy through a series of metaphors that include recalibrate, messages, re-acclimatise, drill.\nMETAPHOR AND TALK 207 Extract 6 Doctor explains treatment to a patient2 1 actually what’s required is a behaviou- ral approach to try and tackle that problem and re-recalibrate those messages in a 5 way so that actually your brain re- acclimatises to only passing only getting the message pass urine when the pressure volume is signiﬁcant 10 so it actually is quite an uncomfortable process to go through we call it bladder drill In addition to their ideational function, the sub-technical metaphors also work on an affective plane, through empathy and through personiﬁcation. In line 10, the doc- tor explicitly empathises with the patient with the euphemistic metaphor uncomfort- able. In line 8, he uses personiﬁcation when he speaks of the brain as getting the message. As in the agenda management process of Extract 4, the personiﬁcation of non-human processes serves to make them less distant and threatening. The philosopher David Cooper cites Hegel’s suggestion that personiﬁcation is ‘an important strategy for making the world seem less alien’. He argues further that metaphor works towards the ‘cultivation of intimacy’ among people and socio-cultural groups, and that this affective function may be even more crucial to human beings than the ideational function of develop- ing concepts (Cooper, 1986, p. 166). How- ever, we might wish to argue the relative importance of the affective and the concep- tual, we need to take account of the many ways in which linguistic metaphor inﬂu- ences the attitudes and feelings of people in interaction. Linguistic and Conceptual Metaphor Having seen various features of metaphor as it is used in talk, and how speakers shape and shift metaphor as they work towards greater understanding or less distance, this section considers how linguistic metaphor in dynamic and dialogic interaction connects with conceptual metaphor as hypothesised in cognitive metaphor theory. The connection is not straightforward. Cognitive metaphor theory is concerned with thinking or concepts abstracted across speech communities rather than with indi- vidual language use and thinking. In the other direction, instances of language use cannot give researchers direct access to thought or mental representations, but only offer traces of activity from which infer- ences can be made. To cross the gap between discourse evidence and cognitive metaphor theory requires theoretical and empirical work; the gap may even be epistemo- logically unbridgeable. Meanwhile, I sug- gest two important caveats for researchers in both discourse analysis and cognitive linguistics: r The systematic metaphors that can be abstracted from discourse events are not necessarily conceptual metaphors. r The minds of individual language users do not necessarily include conceptual metaphors as part of their cognitive resources. Each is now discussed. Systematic and Conceptual Metaphors When analysing metaphor in talk, it is pos- sible to gather together semantically con- nected linguistic metaphors into sets. For example, the metaphor of reconciliation as building a bridge can be seen as linked with metaphors in Extract 1 such as broken, (not) separate, (not) detached, on every side, with the extension a bridge with two ends, and with many other metaphorical expres- sions in the data. Across all these linguistic metaphors the Vehicle domain of ‘connec- tion’ is mapped on to the Topic domain of reconciliation, where the label ‘connection’ is chosen to capture general idea expressed by the linguistic metaphors. The partici- pants in the reconciliation talk can then be said to use the metaphor: RECONCILIATION\n208 LYNNE CAMERON IS CONNECTION. I call such generalised mappings from a particular discourse con- text, ‘systematic metaphor’. The use of systematic metaphors in a dis- course event is signiﬁcant in suggesting how participants are thinking about topics as they talk about them. However, while the system- atic metaphor may well describe something of individuals’ underlying conceptual knowl- edge, it cannot be assumed to be a ‘concep- tual metaphor’. Conceptual metaphors are ‘enduring conceptual mappings from source to target domains that motivate a wide range of linguistic expressions’ (Gibbs, 2002, p. 80), that is they are conventionalised across a speech community. Systematic lin- guistic metaphors are likely to be inﬂuenced by the context of discourse, by the topic, and by the nature of the discourse event. To claim RECONCILIATION IS CONNECTION as a conceptual metaphor would require additional evidence of conventionalisation from a range of reconciliation contexts and events. The methodological problem of choos- ing how to label a systematic metaphor to best capture the nature of a collection of linguistic metaphors found in data (also discussed in Semino, 2005; Semino, Hey- wood, & Short, 2004; Vervaeke & Kennedy, 1996) can be resolved somewhat by hold- ing on to this distinction between system- atic and conceptual metaphors. While cog- nitive metaphor theory, because of its aims, needs to describe conceptual metaphorical mappings in the most abstract and general form possible, researchers concerned with the thinking of speciﬁc individuals are prob- ably well advised not to generalise too far from the actual words used in the linguistic metaphors. Generalising from linguistic metaphor to conceptual metaphor also risks hiding the ﬁnding that talk contains large proportions of verb metaphors. The high incidence of verb metaphors in empirical data contrasts with the nominalised A IS B form con- ventionally given to conceptual metaphors. Grouping and labelling linguistic metaphors in cognitive metaphor theory is a nomi- nalising process: for example, when verb metaphors such as comes to (Extract 1, line 1) and move on (section on healing as metaphor) are grouped under the conceptual umbrella of JOURNEY metaphors. In their 2004 paper, Semino and col- leagues discuss issues in labelling the concep- tualisations underlying linguistic metaphors found in a study of conversations of can- cer patients. Their discussion of three metaphors – galloping away; erupt; dormant – is particularly relevant here. They argue that generalising up to conceptual metaphors CANCER IS A HORSE; CANCER IS A VOL- CANO is not warranted, since their data includes no examples of direct reference to horses, animals, or volcanoes in relation to cancer. Their alternative analysis takes account of the conventional metaphorical collocates of the linguistic metaphor vehicle terms in other domains in order to decide on an appropriate conceptual metaphor label. Investigation of corpus data showed that only 38% of the collocates of the verb erupt include volcano (es). The other 62% involve metaphorical collocates such as ﬁre or sound, war, groups of people, new situations or move- ments, sores or spots on the skin. They then propose a conceptual metaphor VIOLENT NEGATIVE ACTIVITY IS OVERFLOW FROM A CONTAINER, within which erupt would be one kind of overﬂow resulting from the fur- ther metaphor BODY PARTS ARE CONTAIN- ERS, thus avoiding the metaphor CANCER IS A VOLCANO. The use of additional cor- pus evidence allows them to propose a con- ceptual metaphor on the basis of linguistic metaphor evidence. Although this analysis still involves some nominalisation, as ACTIV- ITY/OVERFLOW, it produces a much more ‘verbal’ description of the conceptualisation underlying verbal linguistic metaphor. An alternative to the inductive methods just described is to work deductively, search- ing out linguistic metaphors in talk that appear to instantiate conceptual metaphors, or to combine inductive and deductive approaches. For example, Keller-Cohen and Gordon (2003) use linguistic metaphors, including proven guilty, innocent, as evidence for a claim that their interviewee uses the conceptual (or more accurately, systematic)\nMETAPHOR AND TALK 209 metaphor of BEING ON TRIAL to structure the narrative in her life story. The struc- ture of the source/vehicle domain is then expanded, and other metaphorical state- ments are mapped onto it, thereby building up their claim. These different approaches to spoken discourse data illustrate how sys- tematicity in linguistic metaphor can gener- ate hypotheses about conceptual metaphor that can be tested further with different kinds of evidence. Conceptual Metaphors and Individual Minds In the process of developing contemporary metaphor theory, claims about conceptual metaphor have abstracted away from the use of linguistic metaphor in the talk of individ- uals and are made about some generalised speech community. When cognitive linguists then speak of metaphors ‘we’ use, it is impor- tant to remember that they are (or should be) referring to ‘people in general’, and not to speciﬁc individual language users. Conceptual metaphors may ‘exist’ in the mind of an individual, acquired and developed through culturally contextualised experience and interaction with the phys- ical and social world. If so, each individ- ual will have a slightly different version, since they have different minds, developed through different experiences and inter- actions. On the other hand, conceptual metaphors may not be in the minds of indi- viduals at all, only ‘existing’ in their system- atised and abstracted forms, as written down by cognitive linguists, or in distributed form across many people within a cultural context (Gibbs, 1999; Quinn, 1991). Conclusion There is still much to be discovered about metaphor in talk, and I would highlight the following as needing to be placed on the research agenda: r work with large connected data sets to understand more about the dynamics of metaphor in talk on several inter- connected timescales and levels of social organisation. r the role of personal style in metaphor use r the interaction of genre and metaphor use r the impact of metaphor absence in a range of discourse contexts. The methods and categories used in inves- tigation and description need to capture the interactional and dynamic nature of metaphor in talk. In the building of metaphor theory, lin- guistic metaphor is often taken as starting point and as evidence. However, the lin- guistic metaphor that we see in such argu- ments is often stunted and impoverished in comparison with the richness and com- plexity observed in its use in talk. The chapter has reviewed some of what we know about how people use metaphor in their talk, the nature of linguistic metaphor, how it shifts and changes in the process of talk, and how metaphor helps speak- ers achieve interactional purposes. From the traces that we ﬁnd in talk, we are build- ing up a picture of metaphor as a varied and multidimensional language resource. Its nature reﬂects its evolution in the dynam- ics of situated language use, created through the constraints and affordances of the human brain/mind, with its search for coher- ence and desire for novelty, and through the needs and pleasures of human social interaction.

However, education is now an enormous area and the number of articles and books dealing with metaphorical aspects of it is far beyond the scope of a short article.1 What I want to do in this chapter is to select a small number of topics that I consider to be central to educa- tion, but which remain problematic in one way or another, or are simply unresearched. I shall attempt to examine why they are prob- lematic and establish, more positively, if any- thing can be done to reduce the problems. I start by considering the role of metaphor in implementing educational change. I argue that metaphor analysis does have a useful role to play, but that many of the pub- lished examples, from Sch¨on’s (1979) gen- erative metaphor, to the semiotic analysis of Labbo (1996) and Oxford et al.’s (1998) lan- guage teacher/ing metaphors, tend to over- identify metaphor and ignore the complex and content-sensitive role of metonymy. Metaphoric modelling in education cannot be somehow outside the normal constraints and rigour of empirical academic analysis. I then go on to look at the importance of metaphor in teaching and learning. The last half of this section concentrates on the important problem of foreign language teaching, where learning about the subject is not the aim of learning and indeed may have little effect on language acquisition. After a brief review of metaphoric competence, I examine three fairly practical problems: when to teach things as metaphor (and when not to), how to cope with cultural differ- ences, and whether to teach basic senses ﬁrst. Essentially, I argue that we cannot just apply recent cognitive theory indiscriminately to the classroom. We need, for example, to think carefully about how much metalan- guage learners can reasonably be exposed to. We also need to consider how metaphor is used at discourse level (i.e. not just as an aspect of vocabulary), and to establish what it is that we want learners to actually do with metaphor. Lastly, we need to recognise that testing for ‘metaphoric competence’ in a for- eign language poses particular difﬁculties for proﬁciency testing as currently conceived. The chapter ends with some recommen- dations for future research. 212\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 213 Metaphor and Educational Change Educational concepts and processes are fre- quently described in metaphoric terms, either as single “A IS B” metaphors (e.g. EDUCATION IS PREPARING MENTAL MEALS; LEARNING IS POURING WATER INTO A JUG), or as clusters of metaphors. The rea- sons for creating analogies or models are gen- erally fairly obvious; one wants to, r ﬁnd a salient, memorable label for an oth- erwise difﬁcult concept; r clarify a concept which is diffuse, abstract, or generally complex; r extend thought; or r locate problems with a particular concep- tualisation and then bring about some sort of change. It was this last point which led Sch¨on (1993) to develop his inﬂuential narrative approach, which he called “generative metaphor”. In most therapy or counselling sessions, the analyst lets the patient talk freely about his/her life and problems and listens for key events or key words. If key terms are identiﬁed, these can then be focused on and become the basis for further action, or treatment. In reality, things are more complicated than this and recent research (e.g. Cameron, 2003b; Cameron & Stelma, 2004) has emphasised the to-ing and fro- ing of metaphor between counsellor and “patient”. However, Sch¨on’s idea was that if planners listened to the “stories” told by people affected by a situation, these people would spontaneously indicate, by their use of metaphor, what was upper- most in their minds and the way they con- ceptualised their problem(s). The planners thus needed to listen out for the salient metaphoric expression, establish what it showed in the speaker’s mind, translate this into what it implied in the planners’ concep- tualisation of the situation, and then make changes. A metaphorical version, almost, of grounded theory in education. It is the fact that the metaphor, once located, leads plan- ners to think in new ways and to imple- ment changes they had not thought of that explains Sch¨on’s use of the label “generative metaphor”. The generative metaphor procedure makes two problematic assumptions. The ﬁrst is that the speaker does in fact con- ceptualise the situation in metaphoric terms. Unfortunately, this assumption is belied by Sch¨on’s own examples of housing policy, which either show metaphor closely linked to metonymy (urban areas can show “decay” and communities need to be “healthy”, p. 145), or, in the case of a locale likened to a “natural community” which needs space to interact (p. 146), are almost entirely metonymic. The second assumption is that the informant does not need metaphoric lan- guage to indicate or convey metaphor. How- ever, if no metaphoric language is needed, it becomes virtually impossible for the researcher to validate any metaphors iden- tiﬁed. One might argue, though Sch¨on does not, that identiﬁcation is possible if phenom- ena like pictures coexist with the narrative – or in the case of oral narratives, cough- ing, drawing pictures, or behaviourally act- ing out a metaphor while talking (Low, 1999, 2003). The value of this sort of secondary support is emphasised by Cortazzi and Jin (1999) in their similar, “narrative” approach to discovering teachers’ conceptualisations of learning. But the point is that the images or behaviour constitute further evidence of metaphor, not the only evidence. One might also note that neither of the planning texts cited as evidence by Sch¨on are “stories” or “narratives” by affected users, in the sense that Cortazzi and Jin’s speakers were the teachers or students who were the interested parties. Rather, the texts were by planners or by later analysts, so one might argue that context is important and that dif- ferent parties will generate evidence of dif- ferent types and values. To sum up, framing problems is ﬁne, but you cannot assume the framing is metaphoric. Indeed, metonymy may even be an inevitable aspect of generative metaphor. It is noticeable, for example, that Block’s (1999) excellent attempt to apply genera- tive metaphor to second language acquisi- tion research situations resulted in a set of\n214 GRAHAM LOW examples that were almost totally meto- nymic. Similarly, Sarason’s (1993) use of Sch¨on’s procedure to argue the case for wholesale educational change in the United States generated (as it were) two valu- able perspectives, “primary prevention” and “reform”, but how far these are genuinely metaphors is highly debatable; despite the persistent use by one of the book’s reviewers of “new images” and “multiple lenses” (Har- rington, 1994), the concepts are better seen as metonymies, or even as quite literal activi- ties. Lastly, both the nature and source of the data used as input are important and need to be discussed as part of the procedure. This sort of metaphoric modelling has proved particularly attractive to language educators, who have not only constructed metaphoric models of language learning and teaching, but have often linked them to teacher development. Indeed, the implica- tion can be that teachers found to be miscon- ceptualising, say, language as a conduit, are in need of some sort of re-education (Block, 1992; de Guerrero & Villamil, 2002). In a short survey of such models of teaching and learning (Low, 2003), I noted four method- ological problems that echo the comments above on generative metaphor. Problem 1: Assuming a Priori That Metaphor Must Be Involved The assumption that all observed behaviour can be treated as metaphor, and that clusters of metaphors can always be given “overarch- ing” labels goes well beyond Sch¨on’s claim and is a feature of semiotic analysis (Labbo, 1996). However, Labbo’s own study of chil- dren developing aspects of literacy in their ﬁrst language illustrates two of the difﬁcul- ties of making this assumption. First, the author admitted to creating the metaphors to match her own interpretation (“It cannot be assumed that screenland is a metaphor the children would sanction”, p. 380) and secondly, even the data cited at times failed to provide a justiﬁcation for treating it as metaphoric. Simply ﬁnding children playing around in class, for example, is not by def- inition metaphoric, unless evidence can be found of play being treated by the children as something else (or vice versa). Problem 2: Identifying an Underlying Metaphor Simply Because an Expression Is Consistent with It This is a frequent complaint about concep- tual metaphor research in particular and can simply indicate an over-enthusiastic analyst. An example would be where Oxford et al. (1998, p. 12), conclude that reports of a teacher rushing through a syllabus “there- fore led to the inescapable . . . Teacher as manufacturer metaphor”. The reports are consistent with the metaphor, but no more. One cannot use them to make claims about metaphors of teaching. Problem 3: Treating a Descriptive Model as a Procedural Model The fact that someone uses a metaphoric expression does not prove that the under- lying metaphor is actively used by them as a guide to thinking or acting. Neither does the fact that an analyst ﬁnds a metaphor to be an apt way of capturing the essential details of a situation. Hence, Scribner’s (1988) descrip- tion of literacy as “divine grace”, where above-average readers are in a “state of grace” but below-average ones have fallen from it, carries no implication whatsoever that read- ers themselves conceive of their skills in reli- gious terms. In Bartelt (1997), a group of English as a foreign language (EFL) univer- sity students consistently reported translat- ing from their ﬁrst language (L1) when they spoke the target language (or L2). Bartelt interpreted the translation as a metaphor (though the evidence for this is not con- vincing) and noted several times that this was a description of the data. At the same time, however, he argued that the model was in effect procedural, and that it “largely determine[s] not only perceptions, but also the types of interaction selected [by the learners] to deal with in the [external] envi- ronment” (p. 34) and that the saliency of the model in the learners’ brains was sufﬁcient to necessitate a wholesale change in teaching\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 215 methods (p. 33). It may well have been the case that a change would have been highly desirable, but speciﬁc evidence is needed to argue that the cause of metaphoric language or behaviour is an internalised procedural model. Problem 4: Reporting Metonymic Links as If They Were Metaphor Oxford et al. (1998) propose, on the basis of their data, the metaphors TEACHING AS REPEATING and TEACHER AS DELEGATOR. The problem here is that teachers have to repeat and delegate many times in a quite literal fashion as part of their basic job. Focusing on the relationship between delegating and teaching at the expense of the teacher’s other roles is metonymy, not metaphor. For repeating to be metaphoric, the teacher would need to appear to be repeating, while not actually repeating. A more complex example of the same confu- sion comes from Block (1992), who reported the student-generated metaphor A TEACHER IS A FRIEND. If a teacher acts “like a friend” without actually being one, a limited case for metaphor could be sustained. On the other hand, being friendly is simply one core aspect of being a professional teacher, so there is a strong case for metonymy. If the student feels that the friendliness is sufﬁcient to justify seeing the teacher as a real friend (or more realistically perhaps, as a “sort of friend”) then presumably the metaphor claim would become invalid. The classiﬁcation “being my friend” is notoriously unstable with teenagers and so the claims for metaphor or metonymy could vary with context: both between students and within students, that is, from hour to hour. The role of metonymy in educational models is extremely interesting from a con- ceptual or a discourse point of view, but one needs to ask whether it is as interesting from an educational viewpoint. In one sense, the planner or teacher trainer is simply present- ing the reader with a series of characteristics of the job or task, noting that some people overemphasise one or two of the character- istics and suggesting that such an imbalance can lead to undesirable teaching or learning behaviour. On the other hand, the TEACHER AS FRIEND example shows that metaphor and metonymy can be hard to differenti- ate because the grounds for categorisation can vary depending on context. This con- text dependency can become important if the object of the analysis is, as it is with gen- erative metaphor, to implement long-term stable social or educational change. Just as Lakoff and Johnson (1980) ex- plored the points where different metaphors for, say, ANGER are inconsistent or cannot be mixed, so one other important use of metaphoric models is to examine multi- ple metaphors for vagueness, ambiguity, or confusion within an education policy, or policy document. Thus, Goatly (2002) dis- sected the various metaphors of the Hong Kong government’s (2000) proposal for edu- cational reform and established that sev- eral either involved little actual reform, or else appeared to act more as a barrier to reform. Either way, they clashed with the metaphors that did appear to suggest gen- uine reform. Goatly concluded that the gov- ernment was offering mixed messages, or simply being vague by using the same lex- eme (construction; building) to mean several, often opposed, things. In sum, then, metaphor analysis can play an important role in establishing educational problems and indicating fruitful directions for change, but only where methodological precautions are taken and the evidence is rigorously evaluated. Metaphor and Teaching/Learning Metaphoric models repeatedly present the educator with metaphors in A IS B format (e.g. TEACHING IS BREADMAKING) – a for- mat much less frequent in naturally occur- ring discourse than verb, or noun, phrases. One may accordingly ask whether learn- ers too should be presented directly with metaphors or analogies in A IS B form.2 For subjects other than language, the position seems uncontroversial and backed by a range of research studies. Using analogies is an\n216 GRAHAM LOW essential aspect of academic expertise, whether one is discovering things or cre- ating theories (Goswami, 1992; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995; Sutton, 1993); they are “an utterly essential part of theories” (Camp- bell, cited in Hesse, 1966, 4); they allow the teacher to communicate with learners who have not mastered a theory (Lawson, 1993); they allow learners to visualise abstract concepts (Duit, 1991); they allow learners to generate inferences and testable predic- tions (Dagher, 1995; Duit, 1991; Gentner & Holyoak, 1997; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995; Lawson, 1993; Sutton, 1993); they moti- vate learners (Duit, 1991); they allow the teacher to tailor teaching to individual needs and levels of understanding (Duit, 1991). Metaphors also affect subsequent behaviour (as where Bromme and Stahl’s [1999] stu- dents created different types of hypertext documents, depending on the “hypertext is . . .” metaphor they had learned). Finally, Cameron (2003a) noted that if a metaphor is adequately salient, it can also aid recall at a later date, particularly if it is concrete rather than abstract (Harris et al., 1999, 7). A IS B format seems particularly impor- tant where younger children are involved. Research suggests (e.g. Cameron, 2003a; Gentner & Toupin, 1986) that they cannot work with analogies and metaphors unless (a) the metaphors are presented explic- itly, (b) Source–Target correspondences are given, and (c) the children have an ade- quate understanding of the Source domain before the metaphor is given. Cameron’s (2003a) study showed that this latter point applied within a (class) discourse as well as between sessions; metaphor only really worked with 10-year-olds when the Grounds had been given by the teacher and under- stood earlier in the same lesson. Sequenc- ing of metaphoric language and information within a lesson is therefore crucial. A further constraint was noted by Spiro et al. (1989). Spiro et al. were concerned that single A IS B metaphors were leading university medical students to create over- simpliﬁed and even false models of the con- cepts being taught, and that the problem was exacerbated where everyday senses of terms were transferred to scientiﬁc domains. One of their suggestions was that teaching should involve multiple metaphors, where each metaphor was designed to compen- sate for what was being backgrounded by the others. There have been few empiri- cal tests of such systematic convergence, but Cameron’s observational study did ﬁnd that successful primary teaching of science appeared to correlate with the use of more than one metaphor. Another area that is important, but which is relatively unresearched, is the extent to which explicit training in metaphor might help learners cope with poor or misleading explanations by textbook writers or teachers. This sort of situation can occur even in quite surprising contexts; just to give one exam- ple, Low (2005) examined how an account of (Darwinian) evolution of life on earth in the leading article of a high-status science magazine was (ironically) full of animacy terms and metaphors. It is clear that humans do compensate “naturally” for rhetorical devices such as extreme case formulation in conversation (thus mothers adjust rapidly to “But everyone’s got new trainers, Mum!”), but how far this skill extends to coping with academic explanations is unknown. We might expect the ﬁnding (above) that metaphor training leads to a greater ability to ﬁnd and solve problems to extend to poor explanations, but apart from some support from a study by Littlemore (2004), again we simply do not know. A constructivist approach to learning would predict that learning would be increased if students could engage critically with academic concepts by generating their own analogies. BouJaoude & Tamim (2000) cite a series of studies which indicate that this is (or can be) the case; students who were able to generate their own analogies demonstrated an increase in critical think- ing, questioning and problem-solving skills, and an ability to apply them to scientiﬁc texts and ideas (Middleton, 1991; Wittrock & Alesandrini, 1990; Wong, 1993). They also demonstrated greater recall of subject- speciﬁc detail when reading (Glynn, 1996). The fact that this can happen does not imply\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 217 that all students ﬁnd analogy generation easy or helpful. Of the ﬁfty-one 12-year-olds studying biology in BouJaude and Tamim’s study, for example, all reported that analo- gies helped them recall concepts taught, but only 18% said they would use them without the teacher’s advice and just 6% found them helpful for studying (2000, p. 62); the oth- ers preferred study methods relating to what appeared in their exams. Learning a second language is not the same as studying science. Knowing about a language is not the same as using it, react- ing to words out of context is not the same as using them in context and, most worry- ingly of all, it still remains singularly unclear how far direct instruction actually facilitates acquisition. Being presented with models or rules of the grammar of the target language, for example, appears to have minimal effects on language learning, particularly where the advice is intended as developmental or as corrective feedback (Norris & Ortega, 2000; Truscott, 1996, 2004). Truscott did however note that in some studies, direct presenta- tions of grammar rules nevertheless resulted in increased learning of lexis, rather than grammar. This would seem to suggest that there is a chance that A IS B presentations might aid the acquisition of at least some lexis. Whether they will aid learners to use the lexis productively is entirely another matter. To date, however, the bulk of the published interventions have proposed pre- cisely that: increased learning should result from the student being shown (or intuit- ing) the A IS B metaphors which under- lie target language vocabulary (or grammar) items, followed by some sort of discussion with the teacher, or between the learners. It has to be said, however, that most of the studies in the literature are not randomised controlled trials, or even controlled trials, and few involve adequately delayed post- tests. Some are basic pre-/post-test studies, but others are simply suggestive or anecdo- tal. An example is Rich (2002), who recom- mended, on the basis of undisclosed experi- ence, that EFL students may proﬁtably gen- erate and discuss metaphors of the classroom and learning, as a way of group bonding and of raising awareness of one’s own cul- turally derived expectations about teaching and learning. More weight can be put on the results of a number of small-scale empirical stud- ies. Littlemore (2004) for example reported that a group of university EFL students of business and politics were in general more able to think critically by comparing state- ments in L2 academic texts with metaphors, after undergoing an intervention involving guessing, comprehending, and exploring the implications of metaphors, in “naturalis- tic” as well as canonical A IS B form, in subject-speciﬁc discourse. The ﬁnding agrees with those of Middleton (1991) for biology, but the sample was very small and there was no control group. At the level of lexis, Boers (2000) found that EFL university stu- dents recalled vocabulary better in the short term if the expressions had, at the time of presentation, been grouped “meaningfully” in terms of underlying metaphors. In all cases, the metaphors were conventional not innovative. In a similar vein, Cs´abi (2004) found secondary school students had bet- ter short-term recall of phrasal verbs and idioms based on “hold” and “keep” when the underlying metaphors were explained to them. What evidence there is, then, suggests that A IS B presentation can be useful to develop learner motivation and act as input to small group work. It is also easy for a teacher to move discussions about A IS B metaphor structure from regular class work to language awareness sessions. Lastly, it is not hard to instigate discussions where the learners dissect say LOVE IS WAR and develop new metaphors and exponents in the L2. One might predict that A IS B type discussions meet the requirements that lan- guage learners should engage actively with the language, reﬂect on it, and work pur- posefully on tasks using it (Doughty & Long, 2003). However, while all this seems useful in making students notice patterns in the L2 and relate those patterns to real life phenom- ena or social expectations, there is no reason whatsoever to assume that it will increase\n218 GRAHAM LOW (a) their ability to understand a new mes- sage, or its implied appropriateness or cre- ativity, or (b) their skill at producing a ﬂu- ent, accurate, appropriate, rich, humorous or subtle L2 utterance. And it certainly does not guarantee an ability to sustain the to-ing and fro-ing of metaphoric expressions within an interaction. Although Niemeier (1997) suggested that conceptual metaphors like TIME IS MONEY lend themselves to a variety of classroom presentation formats, which allows teach- ers to appeal to different types of learner (repeating the point made by Duit 1991) and to develop holistic teaching methods which provide input visually, intellectually, and physically, the fact remains that there is a virtual absence of empirical interven- tion studies which systematically test and compare alternative approaches to teaching metaphor skills.3 A number of suggestions are listed below, but most still involve ways of clarifying A IS B correspondences or mak- ing them perceptually salient. Lindstromberg (1996) has suggested the use of conceptual diagrams when teach- ing prepositions and indeed trajectory lines (usually arrows) have been used for years to help learners understand time expressions. A conceptual approach to the metaphors underlying “Christmas is approaching” and “We are approaching Christmas” can cer- tainly help the materials designer correct the directionality of the arrows relative to the referent. These are sometimes portrayed in textbooks in ways that run counter to the expressions they are illustrating; thus Hamp- Lyons and Heasley (1987, p. 57) have, TIME1 --> T2 --> T3 --> T4 Past ----------> Present ---> Future rather than, say, TIME (past) <-- DAY1 -- D2 -- D3 -- D4 -- (future) YOU --------------------------\u0002-----------------> but there is still no real documented evi- dence that this enhances the correct or more ﬂuent use of expressions like “the day before yesterday”, or “the following evening”. Again, Lindstromberg (2001) and Holme (2001), have both proposed that acquiring metaphoric items might be facilitated by act- ing them out, in the manner of total phys- ical response (TPR) learning (Asher, 2000). The suggestion is based on the idea that large amounts of metaphor are embodied – in the sense that the Sources not only (a) refer to sensory experience, to the human body, or to relatively familiar actions involving it, but also (b) evoke some sort of sensory response by the listener. Holme suggested acting out tenses in English; Lindstromberg verbs of movement. There is now some preliminary evidence (Lindstromberg & Boers, in press) that advanced learners can learn verbs of movement efﬁciently in the short term using TPR, but more research is needed. One obvious difﬁculty with TPR as a generic solution is that, although some metaphors lend themselves to physical imitation, not all do. Many image schemata, for example, seem “drawable” but scarcely actable and even the primary metaphors suggested by Grady (1998), which tend to be correla- tions between actions and perceptions (like “Swallowing is Accepting”) can be hard to act out in full. So, while the potential for acting out seems well worth exploiting (on the twin indirect justiﬁcations that multi- ple intelligences require multiple modes of presentation, as Neimeier and Duit argued, and that Asher produced valid evidence of learning at initial stages using TPR), it needs to be borne in mind that acting cannot account fully or at all for many metaphors. One fairly obvious variation on acting or drawing is the provision of concrete objects. Basic objects, like containers, feature in several conventional metaphors and image schemata and group interaction with inter- esting objects has long been a stable part of primary level teaching. Li’s (2002) use of physical containers in the classroom might therefore be expected to enhance learning the target language. Unfortunately, while the\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 219 results suggest that increased lexical learning did indeed take place, individual aspects of the teaching method were not analysable as separate variables, so all that can be con- cluded is that, like in Boers and Dechemeleer (2001), generally relating lexis to under- lying metaphor enhances short-term recall. A further device that has been suggested (e.g. by Boers & Demecheleer, 1998) as a way of dealing with the fuzziness and sub- tlety of metaphoric extension is to present learners with a set of sentences organised in a cline with the literal senses ﬁrst, fol- lowed by increasingly metaphorical ones. Again, however, while the technique makes considerable sense for words with compli- cated patterns of extension (like “off” or “over”), there is no empirical evidence sug- gesting that it genuinely aids performance or learning, and even at an explanatory level it hides the divergent pathways (or radial categories) needed for an adequate explanation. One possible approach to helping learners identify and work with L2 metaphor might be to teach it initially in explicit form as simile, paralleling science teaching accounts, such as “atoms are like solar systems”. There may be some limited value to this in spe- ciﬁc contexts, but many metaphoric expres- sions are not easily expressible as similes, particularly where a degree of possession is asserted; “You are my life” becomes almost meaningless as “You are like my life”, or again, “Honey” becomes almost insulting if full identiﬁcation is not made and the addressee is simply held to resemble a thick ﬂuid. Even where a choice of format exists between metaphor and simile, people have been found to show fairly strong preferences for one or the other, depending on whether the transfer involves simple attributes or relationships (Aisenman, 1999). At a dis- course level, similes are far from straight- forward, and can be seen as avoidance and obfuscation devices as much as tools for clariﬁcation. People also have a tendency to interpret them differently from metaphors, relying much more on existing (or core, or typical) semantic knowledge (Fishlov, 2003). This is even reﬂected in conven- tional expressions; “life is a joke” involves little or no humour, whereas “life is like a joke” may well do. In sum, similes have limited value as training tools for metaphor interpretation. Before leaving this section, I would like brieﬂy to return to the topic of pri- mary metaphor. Grady and Johnson (2002, pp. 535–536) make the frequently observed point that conventional expressions relating to THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS, do not make use of several core characteristics of build- ings, like having windows or walls. They argue however that such vocabulary “gaps” are better explained by going below the conceptual metaphor to “primary” A IS B connections such as PERSISTING IS REMAIN- ING ERECT and ORGANISATION IS PHYSI- CAL STRUCTURE; a building is simply an exempliﬁcation of the primary metaphors. There is little in the way of published edu- cational intervention studies, but intuitively, the idea of presenting language learners with primary metaphors has great appeal, espe- cially if the learners are adult and at an advanced level. Teachers can ask, “Where exactly is the metaphor in this expression?” and answers like “intimacy is closeness” (leading to “psychological distance is real dis- tance”) may be easy to comprehend. On the other hand, it is unclear how far younger learners could understand explanations so far removed from the surface expressions and it is not at all clear whether any learn- ers could cope with the categories of “pri- mary scene” and “primary subscene” devel- oped to constrain and explain the primary metaphors. Establishing What to Teach Deciding what exactly to teach is far from easy in language education. At times, it is clear that an expression or structure needs to be taught, but there is no agreement about whether it is (or should be treated as) metaphor. This applies particularly to\n220 GRAHAM LOW things like delexical verbs (e.g. “make a joke”, “have a laugh”) and to numerous ﬁxed expressions (Grant & Bauer, 2004, have a good summary of previous arguments). At the level of discourse, identiﬁcation prob- lems can relate more to agreeing on bound- aries than on word meaning; does one, for example, include the literal Target (“they”) as well as the Source terms (“pigged out”) as the “metaphoric expression” in a text? If a word is metaphoric, does one include all syntactically dependent expressions such as relative clauses (i.e. do they “inherit” metaphoricity?) (Steen, 1999). Staying at the level of discourse, there are further occa- sions when it may simply not be clear what metaphor is used for, how listeners and speakers use it, and/or whether one would wish to teach it anyway. Thus, although both Str¨assler (1982) and Low (1988) ﬂagged the fact that many conventional emotion metaphors seem far more appropriate to third party reports than personal confes- sions in face-to-face interactions (“he hit the roof” rather than “I shall hit the roof when I see you next”), the topic remains rela- tively unresearched and K¨ovecses, making exactly the same point in 2003, is forced to rely on an anecdotal discussion with a sin- gle native speaker. A more poignant exam- ple is whether you actively teach learners to use metaphor to (verbally) attack individu- als or else to operate, as politicians are often accused of doing, just this side of the edge of telling lies. The answer depends on your phi- losophy of language teaching. If you believe (as I do) that learners should be trained to survive in the real L2 world and actually be able to come out on top when they interact with native speakers, then the answer is a qualiﬁed yes. A less controversial question is whether we ask learners to look for chains and clus- ters in discourse, and to produce them when they speak or write. There is abun- dant evidence that the phenomena exist in oral and written discourse. Metaphors reg- ularly form chains through text (e.g. Gar- ton et al., 1991; Koller, 2003), frames con- currently around whole texts, subsections and paragraphs (Low, 1997; Koller, 2003) and clusters at key points (Cameron & Low, 2004; Corts & Meyers, 2002; Koller, 2003; Low, 2005; Cameron & Stelma, 2004). People create these effects for clarity, to focus the receiver’s attention, or to induce a particular type of conceptualisation of the topic. There is some suggestion that the differing reasons are more concentrated in oral text (resulting in single multifunctional expressions) and can be more spread out in written texts (Low, 1997, 2005). Possi- bly inadvertently, producers also often add “outliers” to their clusters. These outliers are not “regular” metaphors, but take on a degree of metaphoricity by virtue of being near clear-cut metaphors (Low, 2005), and since they can occur before as well as after the metaphors, recognition can depend in part of how often one reads the text (Sayce, 1953). There would seem to be little reason for not teaching students to work with these phenomena in the L2, at least at an advanced level. The Notion of Metaphoric Competence Discussing metaphor interpretation and use in skill terms introduces the notion of metaphoric competence. At a very general level, few would deny that we want learners to develop metaphoric competence in the L2. The problem is trying to establish what that means in practice. Different approaches are possible. One could start with interac- tions and texts and list a number of key skills that learners need to do with them if they are to survive in an L2 environ- ment. Examples would be “knowing where a speaker has shifted the degree of ‘active- ness’ (or metaphoricity) of an expression” (say a technical term), or “knowing when a speaker has gone beyond conventional- ity and is being mildly creative – or else is operating on an ad hoc basis” (e.g. Carter & McCarthy, 2004; Low, 1988). Because these discourse-related skills rely so heavily on the use of social context, linguistic co-text, and one’s expertise in the relevant topic, they are generally compatible with recent\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 221 approaches to task-based teaching, as long as teachers bear in mind that they are rel- evant in one form or another to just about every real-world language-use task. People can activate and deactivate metaphor in everything from buying a loaf of bread to writing an academic journal article. An alternative approach is to isolate a small set of psychological skills which are either held to underlie a broad range of actual metaphor performance, or which are indirectly related to performance and serve more as predictors (e.g. Littlemore, 2001a; Pollio & Smith, 1980). Unfortu- nately, it remains to be shown experimen- tally whether interventions (i.e. teaching) focusing on, say, lateral thinking skills do serve to improve the accuracy, the rhetori- cal/interactive power, or the appropriateness of spontaneous L2 performance – as tested by a delayed post-test comprising free con- struction test items. A third approach is to formulate metaphor skills so that they ﬁt into exist- ing models of communicative competence. The model currently commonest among language teachers and testers treats com- municative competence as comprising four orthogonal components: linguistic, sociolin- guistic (meaning contextual appropriate- ness), discourse, and strategic. The latter is somewhat ambiguous as it can imply learn- ing strategies, communication strategies, or both. The model has developed over a num- ber of years, starting with Canale and Swain (1980), revised by Bachman (1990), by Bach- man and Palmer (1996), and more recently by Douglas (2000). Although Skehan (1998) has criticised the general concept of a com- ponential model of competence as being descriptive rather than explanatory, it has had the merit of helping course designers and language testers build relatively com- prehensive proﬁles and needs analyses. This has also in practice served to limit the inter- est in metaphor. Bachman (1990) treated metaphor as involving oblique cultural ref- erences and an activity which only advanced learners could be expected to do. It can be shown without much difﬁculty (Littlemore & Low, 2006) ﬁrst that metaphor skills apply to all four components (and thus need to be acquired by learners at most levels) and second that learners do in fact experience difﬁculty working with metaphor in all four areas. Clearly, the way metaphoric competence is formulated will depend very much on the purpose of the formulator, and there is no one best solution. From a teaching perspec- tive, it is important to highlight the point that learning about metaphor – learning, for example, that “run up a ﬂag”, “run up a bill”, or “the run up to an election” are metaphoric, or knowing that LOVE IS A JOURNEY has numerous exponents in English – will not per se improve your ability to use metaphoric expressions effectively as a speaker. Nor will it necessarily help you compute implicit and explicit messages on line as a listener. I would thus endorse the value of the ﬁrst of the three approaches above and, with this in mind, I shall list some of the things lan- guage learners need to do, but which they are rarely taught or exposed to in a classroom. Productively, speakers need to know how to use non-speciﬁc metaphor to “decouple” from a narrative or conversational topic, in order to summarise it, evaluate it, withdraw gracefully from the argument, or simply change topic. Receptively, listeners need to be able to pick up on the previous speaker’s metaphor, use their knowledge of the target culture and discourse practices to guess what the speaker is implying, and choose to “run with” the metaphor, extend it, or even close it down. They need moreover to be aware of the implications of the strategy they them- selves adopt. They need to recognise where style jumps take place, where speakers and writers stop being metaphoric. They need to recognise where the speaker is extending or elaborating beyond conventional language and why – are they being friendly, humor- ous, sarcastic, or even addressing a third party? Learners need to recognise where the speaker is avoiding a topic, or refusing to take responsibility (Lerman, 1983). Lastly, they need to recognise when texts or speak- ers are operating simultaneously on multi- ple levels (as in many, possibly most, jokes, advertisements, and banter) and to establish\n222 GRAHAM LOW what effects and messages are being hinted at on each level. We might also note that the effect of an advertisement may well rely on the reader slowly accessing different meanings in real time and that the sequence may well not be from less metaphoric to more metaphoric: much will depend on the contextual clues provided by the accom- panying pictures, text, and even graphic layout. It will be apparent that the above list emphasises receptive skills over productive skills. The reason is simply that all listeners and readers need to cope with “incoming” L2 metaphor, whereas speakers and writers can choose whether and when they use it. What will determine that choice in actual prac- tice remains relatively unresearched, but the list may include existing L1 preferences, as well as the learner’s “identity” as a sec- ond language user – whether they choose to be the sort of person that uses a lot of L2 metaphor. Although the question of L2 identity has been a topic of discussion for some years in the applied linguistic liter- ature, little or none of the discussion has revolved around metaphor and we currently have little idea whether learners transfer metaphor preferences across languages, or construct preferences anew as they acquire an L2. The Canale/Swain/Bachman model of communicative competence has been widely used as a basis for designing language tests and this raises the question of how metaphoric competence can best be tested. Speciﬁc teaching interventions will require tests of the content or skills involved, like any other achievement test (as in the case of Littlemore 2001). Far more interesting is how metaphoric competence could be tested as part of general L2 proﬁciency. I noted earlier that forced-choice and even constrained-response tests have been shown to overestimate learning in key areas of language (Norris & Ortega, 2000; Truscott, 1998), so we might assume that metaphoric competence is best tested by some form of free-response direct communicative test. There have been to date very few attempts to generate an overall measure of L2 metaphoric competence. One recent excep- tion is Azuma (2003), who paired a test of interpreting metaphors in running text with a test which required learners to use speciﬁc target metaphors in a free writing exercise. However, even here, no attempt was made to distinguish or assess the sort of discourse control skills mentioned earlier and the primary interest was examining how the test related to vocabulary knowledge. Accurately measuring metaphoric com- petence, especially productively, is not going to be easy, largely because the use of active/deliberate metaphor is usually optional, and almost every discourse task can be achieved perfectly adequately without it. On the other hand, we are now beginning to obtain reliable estimates of the average fre- quency of metaphor in native-speaker texts of various types (e.g. Koller, 2003; Cameron, 2003a; Cameron & Stelma, 2004), so these could perhaps be used in future to give rough estimates of over and underuse. Such esti- mates would however need to be judged against baseline L1 data of individual pref- erences. However, not only is it rare for lan- guage proﬁciency tests of any sort to mod- ify their scores with reference to desired L2 identity, but we are, as I noted above, some way away from linking individual metaphor- use preferences and L2 metaphor use, so there is little in the way of precedent in the research literature. In short, we still do not know exactly how we would expect L2 learners to dif- fer in terms of metaphoric competence. We do, however, know that cultural back- ground plays an important part in metaphor interpretation. Littlemore (2001) found that a group of Bangladeshi civil servants mis- read the evaluative content of a UK lec- ture on government, because they expected that “speakers in authority would not criti- cise their own government”. She also noted (2003) that students from a culture that is less tolerant of uncertainty found it dif- ﬁcult to grasp a lecturer’s contention that “freeing up the economy” is a good idea. It has been repeatedly found that learn- ers interpret the L2 through the “lens” of their L1 (e.g. Kellerman, 1986, 2001;\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 223 Sakuragi & Fuller, 2003), but if this is the case, it is hard to see how one single proﬁciency test battery could realistically be used as a universal measure of metaphoric competence. If an Expression Involves Metaphor, Do We Teach It as Metaphor? Thus far, I have noted that identifying a metaphor may not be simple or straightfor- ward, but in general, when something has been identiﬁed as metaphoric, the assump- tion has been made that it should be treated as such by the teacher and the learner. It is, however, important to recognise that this is no more than an assumption and its validity is worth exploring. Vocabulary would appear to be the area most conducive to teaching items as metaphor in the language classroom, but even in this context, the need for a complex metalanguage rapidly arises. The teacher needs, for example, to have some way of explaining that another item or sense is somehow “less metaphoric”, or “not metaphoric at all”, or even “metonymic”. Metaphors are also frequently iterative, in the sense that they will use an earlier metaphor as input (i.e. as Source), so it is not enough to explain metaphor as a sim- ple link between a literal and a ﬁgurative sense. Thus, if “in the running for presi- dent” is explained as a transfer from horse racing (Deignan, 2003), “in the running” is still not transparent, largely because it is already metaphoric (and metonymic) in the racing context. It is also hard in many cases to talk cross-culturally about metaphor without reference to metonymy. There are numerous examples in the literature (e.g. Yu, 2003, on differences between English and Chinese), but Charteris-Black (2003) makes the point particularly starkly in his study of ﬁgurative uses of English and Malay oral body parts where he sees the key difference between his two data sets as the “tendency in English to metonymy and hyperbole and in Malay to metaphor and euphemism” (p. 306). The question thus arises of how much metalanguage to introduce and whether all learners can cope with it. There is some indirect evidence on the question of age. It is commonly accepted that young children demonstrate a prefer- ence for thinking metonymically before they think metaphorically (e.g. Winner, 1988) and this has recently been found to be the case for young L2 learners (Piquer, 2003, 2004), so ﬁgurative metalanguage would not seem generally usable below the age of around eight years. Even with adults, it is no easy task to arrive at a meaningful understanding of terms like “literal” with language learners who are not budding linguists. I have seen no published language teaching (or indeed science teaching, it should be added) mate- rials that even begin to approach this topic. I conclude that it may well be desirable to avoid metalanguage unless it is clear that the learners can cope with it. There are in fact numerous points where one has to wonder whether it is prefer- able to teach items “literally”, as simply as “having a certain meaning”. It has been argued, for example, that the “quotative” use of “like” in “I was like ‘it’s great’” developed with a metaphorical component (Buchstaller, 2001a, 2001b) and it could cer- tainly be taught using a Boers-type set of sentences involving a cline of metaphori- city, starting from the “literal” comparison “A chair is like a sofa”. However, the metaphoric component in quotative “like” is not trans- parent, the word would not be identiﬁed as metaphoric, or potentially metaphoric, using, say the Pragglejaz criteria (see Steen, 2005), and it is easy to teach it without any reference to metaphor.4 Similar arguments may be made for teaching delexical verbs; little would seem to be gained pedagogically by hunting for metaphoric support for say- ing, “make an error” and “do an exam” rather than “do an error” and “make an exam”. A rather different situation is represented by the common use of the term “literally” to mean “metaphorically” (as in “She liter- ally hit the roof when I told her”). The word is probably more obviously “metaphoric” than “like”, but this time the meta- phoricity is highly complex, involving an\n224 GRAHAM LOW interaction between several different under- lying metaphors and nonmetaphoric propo- sitions. While intermediate learners can eas- ily be taught to use the word accurately and effectively in their discourse, any attempt to explain the nature of the metaphoricity is likely to be met with incomprehension and confusion. Though it is becoming popular to argue that prepositions and particles should be taught by bringing the nature or degree of the metaphoricity to the learners’ attention (Boers, 2000; Dirven, 2001; Lindstromberg, 1996), I want to argue for a degree of caution and to suggest that the older, na¨ıver direct method approach might just work more effectively in many cases. Most preposi- tions show very complex semantic structure, and we frequently do not understand what motivates certain senses (see Dirven, 2001). Teaching all of them cognitively becomes a highly complex and time-consuming task, with no guarantee that the learner will (a) understand the concepts involved, (b) understand the sense of the expression itself, or (c) actually use the expression in real discourse. One particular area of interest in this connection is the language of classroom or learning management. Huge amounts of the lexis are highly metaphoric (e.g. “go through homework”, “go over it”, “run though a text”, “run over it”, “look through it”, “look over it”, “look at a topic”, “skip over something”, “skip through it”, “pass over it”, “home in on it”, “touch on it”; “work through it”; “work on it”; “work at it, then rework it”). Class- room/learning management represents one of the few genuinely communicative uses of language in formal teaching situations and therefore large amounts of it need to be learned and used by teachers and learners. To some degree, the semantic similarity of the movement verbs and of the dynamic parti- cles in “run over” and “go through” can be rel- atively easily explained using visual images of a sheet of paper and an arrow. But the complexity of distinguishing the radical dif- ference between “pass over a topic” and “go over a topic” would appear to be far too much for young learners. Somehow, a dis- tinction needs to be made, but as yet we have no real criteria for making that judgement. Should We Teach Basic Meanings First? One might assume that metaphor would be cognitively easier to learn if the “literal” or “basic” meaning is acquired ﬁrst, particu- larly as this is often a familiar human activ- ity or closely connected with the human body. When applied to an instructional con- text, however, the argument that abstrac- tions and extensions can best be taught by ﬁrst teaching basic meanings has several practical difﬁculties, especially where con- ventional metaphor is involved. First, the basic sense may well be a much rarer word, possibly representing archaic technology that the learner may never need to use (Low, 1988). Deignan (2003) quotes the example of horse metaphors in English; while literal “horse” occurs in contexts of leisure, metaphors involving horses refer almost totally to transport or heavy work. The rarity situation arises in several ESP con- texts (e.g. to buttress an argument) but is also evident in general English, with words like “arrow” or “cursor”. Second, the “basic sense ﬁrst” require- ment assumes that we can in fact agree on what exactly is logically more basic. For example, the particle “on” is sometimes explained as having two basic senses (posi- tion and movement forward) both of which can be traced back hundreds of years (Lind- stromberg, 1998). On the other hand, it is not hard to create a simple derivation of one from the other. What should the teacher do? And does it really matter? A third difﬁculty is that the metaphori- cal expression may need to be used by the learner early on, before the literal sense. “Buttress” (above) is an example of this, but so is much classroom management lan- guage (“skip that bit”), or greetings (“I’m called Fred”, “How’s life”, “How are you?” “Cheers”), or personal descriptions (“I live in Bristol”, “Tell me about your brother”). The basic-ﬁrst requirement is essentially\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 225 unrealistic here and runs counter to commu- nicative, or particularly task-based learning, principles. Fourth, the basic-ﬁrst requirement assumes a linear, cumulative approach to learning, which is simply not true for language, whether ﬁrst or second. This is tantamount to saying: Lessons 1 to 5 use present tenses, Lessons 6 and 7 the present progressive, and Lesson 8 regular past tenses. However, we know that learners make heavy use of formulae which they analyse as learn- ing develops and interlanguage restructures (see Wray, 2000, 2002). Thus, as Low and Lau argued strongly as far back as 1983, teaching should create unanalysed reference points or reference expressions, which represent points of known sense and use, to which learners can refer when learning becomes more complex or to which they can step back to when con- fused and the interlanguage is undergoing reconstruction. The Importance of Culture I would like to return brieﬂy to the notion of culture in language and language teach- ing. If L2 metaphor genuinely reﬂects L2 culture, should salient aspects of that cul- ture be taught before the linguistic expo- nents, so that the words would have a gen- uine meaning for the learners? There are a number of problems here that researchers have raised but which are rarely considered in the educational literature. For example, if so many animal-related metaphors relate to an agricultural, pre-industrial society, where speakers might actually have some direct experience of animals (e.g. “to hare off”, “an old hen”, “a sow’s ear”), should we initially teach a vision of Jane Austen’s England? If anger metaphors show a line of technolog- ical development from “letting off steam” to “blowing a fuse” and “blowing a gasket”, do we ﬁrst teach the history of technology? If so many emotion metaphors in English derive from the old medical approach to the humours, do we teach that? If English is full of metaphors of the sea and naval battles, do we teach a politically right-wing vision of England as a besieged island community preserving its individual national identity? There is no clear or universal answer to this question. There is possibly a good reason to teach learners about gardening, as Eng- land is full of gardening centres, the airwaves are full of gardening programmes, and the English in general spend much time caring for minute patches of ground. On the other hand, gardening is not terribly motivating to adolescent learners even in England and, more importantly, we need to have some understanding of how contemporary native speakers feel about these metaphors – some- thing which can in part be established, as Stubbs (2001) noted, by exploring the fre- quencies and collocations of literal uses of “horse”, “fuse”, or “garden” in contemporary corpora, but which really also needs sup- porting data from interviews and reaction studies. Deignan (2003) notes that metaphors involving culture frequently involve gener- alised, or prototypical cultural situations. Apart from the important teaching implica- tion that many of these can be expressed as images, or image schemata, which could be taught in terms of pictorial reference points (Constable’s “Haywain” on every classroom wall?), it raises the key question of how far using a metaphor becomes a statement of “buying in” to a culture and/or belief in the patterns underlying the lexis. This was noted as a serious point where teachers are accused of being professionally incompetent if the fact of their using, say, the conduit metaphor is held to reﬂect a belief that this is how communication works. People use conven- tional expressions because they exist and are used, not because they believe them. Only when pressure is exerted to use, for example, “chair” or “chairperson” do peo- ple stop and think about possible implica- tions of (here) “chairman”. Language teach- ers somehow need to ﬁnd a balance between teaching learners to have gut reactions about metaphor and teaching highly inaccurate models of second language culture. They also need to take on board the question of variation and limitation on productive use\n226 GRAHAM LOW of prototypes; does everyone say, “It’s not my cup of tea”? Do coffee drinkers? Younger speakers? Working class speakers? Speakers from minority communities? and when they do use it, is it used “seriously”, or tongue in cheek and humorously? Moreover, can it be abbreviated? Most proverbs can, but I have seen no example of “not my cup”. These con- siderations are central to the interpretation of a metaphor in context and to the learner’s selection of a voice or persona – the L2 per- son that they elect to become. Conclusion Metaphor has been used from time immemorial to facilitate education, and research has begun to indicate why it has proved so enduringly successful. While endorsing its usefulness in expanding the mind, developing critical thinking, encouraging problem ﬁnding, and in aiding categorisation and memorisation, I have tried in this chapter to suggest that this is a good point to stop for a moment and reﬂect. I have suggested, in the context of planning and evaluating educational change, that metaphoric modelling needs to be thought out carefully and the role of metonymy in particular resolved. I have also suggested that applications of cognitive theories of metaphor to language teaching should not be indiscriminate and should go hand-in-hand with research into alternative methods of teaching metaphor and more comprehensive thought about the metaphoric skills we want learners to acquire, especially at discourse level. To this end, I have tried to sound a cautionary note about using metalanguage with learn- ers and assuming that metaphor is easily identiﬁable. I have also argued that testing metaphor skills within the construct of general language proﬁciency presents very different problems from testing metaphor for speciﬁc research projects and remains essentially unknown and unexplored terri- tory. The potential for exciting and dynamic teaching of metaphor is enormous, but there is still a lot of development work to do. This brings me to the ﬁnal section: direc- tions for future research and development. The impact of metaphor and analogy in sci- ence teaching has been researched for several years, but metaphor remains a relatively new topic for foreign language teaching. Devel- oping the arguments in this chapter slightly, I want to suggest ﬁve key research directions for the start of the 21st century: 1. Much of the evidence described in this chapter for success with direct training in cognitive ideas and metalanguage remains purely suggestive, as it has come from stud- ies involving small samples, advanced learn- ers, and a lack of delayed post-tests. Again, while data have been analysed for signiﬁ- cance, effect sizes have not been calculated. What is needed now are studies with larger, mixed-level samples, delayed post-tests and where effect sizes are reported. 2. It is as important that these larger-scale studies test the claim that indirect instruction increases learning (e.g. Littlemore’s, 2004, study of the impact of metaphor training on critical thinking), as it is that they test the claim (e.g. Boers, 2000) that direct teaching aids retention. 3. Further research is also needed into a variety of methods and techniques of teaching metaphor: not just total phys- ical response, but the varied application of visual, tactile, and behavioural support (possibly exploring synaesthesia), as well as the use of contextual factors like more- less metaphoric style jumps (as suggested in Low, 1988). 4. The instructional research needs to go hand-in-hand with innovative attempts to develop innovative metaphor teaching materials and to integrate metaphor teach- ing, at both semantic and pragmatic levels, into learning tasks and activities. The mate- rials and lesson plans in Lazar (2003) and (at the time of writing) the OneStop English Internet site are a very valuable start, but they tend to focus on just semantics/lexis and to be stand-alone exercises, rather than integrated into broader instructional programmes.\nMETAPHOR AND EDUCATION 227 5. Recent attempts to measure learner command of idiomatic and formulaic sequences (e.g. Schmitt, 2004) could be modiﬁed to test certain aspects of meta- phoric competence, but innovative research is needed to establish just how metaphoric competence dovetails with general language competence and to ﬁnd a way of test- ing proﬁciency, particularly with regard to the ‘productive’ skills of reading and writing. Acknowledgement My thanks to Lynne Cameron and Jeannette Littlemore for commenting on the ﬁrst draft of the chapter. Notes 1 Readers interested in a broad canvas can consult Ortony (1999, “Metaphor and Education” section) or Cameron and Low (1999). 2 I include extended A IS B expressions, such as “Lava is like runny butter” (from Cameron 2003a), where a third concept C is added, to denote a constraint or (as here) the Ground. 3 It is of interest to note a degree of circular- ity here; metaphors are suited to holistic lan- guage teaching, but holistic language teach- ing relies heavily on the use of metaphors. A quick check of the index to Stevick’s (1980) classic Teaching Languages: A Way and Ways reveals 12 Sources labelled as metaphor (e.g. “ferry”, “mask”, “pebble”, “spark plug”), three labelled as analogies (“evangelism”, “music” and “swimming”), and at least nine others classable as metaphor (e.g. “mask change”, “soothing syrup”). 4 At the time of this writing, the initial paper describing the Pragglejaz guidelines were being constructed.

We begin by dis- cussing different approaches to the relation- ship between metaphor in literature and metaphor in non-literary language, includ- ing both the study of the properties of metaphorical expressions and the study of readers’ responses to metaphorical expres- sions in different (literary and non-literary) genres. We then show how research on the uses and functions of metaphors in liter- ature has drawn attention to the pattern- ing of metaphors within individual texts, the works of individual authors, and the works belonging to particular literary gen- res. We ﬁnish by considering the impli- cations of these different lines of inves- tigation for future work on metaphor in literature and for metaphor studies more generally: we believe that metaphor in liter- ature needs to be studied by combining lit- erary approaches with discourse analytical, corpus-linguistic, and psycholinguistic tech- niques. A particularly striking example of meta- phor in poetry is the following two lines from Sylvia Plath’s poem ‘Tulips’, written in March 1961. The ﬁrst-person speaker in the poem is a woman who is a patient in a hospital following an operation. The poem is mostly concerned with her reac- tion to the arrival of a bunch of tulips at her bedside, which she perceives as an unwelcome and threatening disruption of the peaceful anonymity of the hospital envi- ronment. The (bright red) ﬂowers are con- trasted with the (white) hospital setting in a range of ways, and via a rich array of metaphors. In particular, the tulips are pre- sented as a reminder of the responsibilities and connections of life outside the hospital, which the poetic speaker had gladly aban- doned in order to become an anonymous hospital patient [according to Ted Hughes (Hughes, 1970), the poem was inspired by some tulips Plath received while recover- ing in hospital after an appendectomy]. In the third of the nine stanzas of the poem, the speaker says that, having now ‘lost’ her- self, she is ‘sick of baggage’. The rest of the stanza makes explicit what she means by ‘baggage’, and ends with the following two lines: 232\nMETAPHOR IN LITERATURE 233 My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks. (Plath, 1965: 20) Although family responsibilities are amongst the aspects of one’s life that can be negatively evaluated via the conventional metaphorical expression ‘baggage’, it is often the case that the enforced loneliness imposed by hospi- talisation leads patients to view more posi- tively their relationships in everyday life, as well as any reminders of those relationships (including ﬂoral gifts and photographs). Readers familiar with Plath’s poetry, how- ever, are unlikely to be surprised by the poetic speaker’s attitude, since they will have come across similarly negative, or, minimally, ambivalent representations of the role of wife and mother in other poems (such as ‘Morning Song’, ‘The Applicant’, and so on). The second line of our quotation adds a fur- ther troubling image, which involves more novel and creative metaphorical expressions than ‘lost myself’, and ‘sick of baggage’ in the ﬁrst part of the stanza. The metaphori- cal expressions ‘catch onto’ and ‘hooks’ con- struct the conventional smiles of the fam- ily photograph as objects that both force an unwelcome physical connection with the poetic speaker and cause her physical pain. The use of these metaphorical expressions potentially triggers a number of contrasts, for example between the (conventionally posi- tive) emotional associations of family pho- tographs and the pain caused by sharp phys- ical objects, and between the visual image of a smile and the concrete physical char- acteristics of hooks. In the context of the poem, this metaphorical representation is consistent with the emotions and world- view expressed in both the previous and the following stanzas. However, this does not reduce its salience and its potentially dis- turbing effects. Most scholars seem to agree that the metaphorical expressions typically found in literature are more creative, novel, original, striking, rich, interesting, complex, difﬁcult, and interpretable than those we are likely to come across in non-literary texts. It is also often claimed that literary writers use metaphor to go beyond and extend our ordi- nary linguistic and/or conceptual resources, and to provide novel insights and perspec- tives into human experience. Plath can be said to be doing precisely this in the lines quoted earlier: she uses creative metaphori- cal expressions to present an unconventional and potentially disturbing perspective on a familiar object (a family photograph) and on a woman’s relationship with her husband and offspring. The single major assump- tion that appears to be shared, implicitly or explicitly, by the vast majority of studies of metaphor in literature is that there is a dif- ference between metaphor in literature and metaphor elsewhere. Different approaches to metaphor in lit- erature, however, disagree, sometimes quite dramatically, on how metaphor in litera- ture differs from metaphor outside litera- ture, or, in other words, on what the rela- tionship is between metaphor in literature and metaphor elsewhere. For the sake of exposition, we will make a broad distinc- tion between approaches that emphasize the discontinuity between metaphor in liter- ature and metaphor in non-literary language, and approaches that emphasize the conti- nuity between metaphor in literature and metaphor in non-literary language. Our own view is that both approaches are correct, and that precise details about the distribution, function, and effect of metaphor in literature versus outside literature need to be collected and examined by means of corpus-linguistic and psycholinguistic studies. The Discontinuity between Metaphor in Literature and Metaphor Outside Literature An important inﬂuence on modern linguis- tic approaches to literary texts has been the Formalist view of literature (and poetry in particular) as characterised by ‘the aes- thetically intentional distortion of the lin- guistic components of the work, in other words the intentional violation of the norms of the standard’ (Mukaˇrovsk´y, 1970, p. 42).\n234 ELENA SEMINO AND GERARD STEEN Anglo-American Stylistics in particular, has developed sophisticated linguistic accounts of the different ways in which linguis- tic choices in literary texts can deviate from general linguistic norms and conven- tions. The use of linguistic deviation, it is argued, foregrounds a particular (stretch of) text, and potentially refreshes (or de- automatizes) the reader’s attitudes and worldviews (e.g. Leech, 1969; Nowottny, 1965; Short, 1996). Within this tradition, the use of metaphorical expressions is seen as a particular type of linguistic deviation involv- ing the semantic level of language, since, it is claimed, metaphorical statements are, if taken literally, illogical, absurd, or nonsensi- cal (e.g. Short, 1996, 43). In the case of our quotation from Plath, the use of the verb ‘catch onto’ with ‘smiles’ as subject and the use of the noun ‘hooks’ with ‘smiling’ as pre-modiﬁer can be described as violations of normal selection restrictions, resulting in apparently illogical, nonsensical meaning relations (i.e. between the concepts evoked by ‘smiling’ and ‘catch- ing onto skin’, and between the concepts evoked by ‘smiles’ and ‘hooks’). This fore- grounds the relevant expressions, demands an interpretation on the part of the reader, and may lead to the de-automatization of the reader’s view of the relevant aspects of reality (e.g. family relations, the experiences of hospital patients, the role of women in the family, and so on). Scholars operating within this tradition also suggest that metaphor in literature is dif- ferent from (and superior to) metaphor out- side literature because of the way in which metaphorical expressions interact with one another and with other aspects of the literary text in which they occur. Now- ottny (1965: 72ff.) points out that poems are more highly structured in linguistic terms than other text-types, and that metaphori- cal patterns in particular can contribute to the complex textual organisation that leads to a poem’s overall signiﬁcance and effects (see also Leech, 1985). This is the case for our example as well. Although the ‘hooks’ metaphor is not extended in ‘Tulips’ beyond the line we have quoted, it can be related to several other metaphorical expressions in the poem that evoke underwater scenar- ios. Earlier in stanza 3, for example, the poetic speaker describes her own body as a pebble that the nurses tend to as water gently runs over pebbles; in stanza 4 she describes herself as a sinking cargo boat; in stanza 6 she describes the tulips as ‘a dozen red lead sinkers’; in stanza 8 the result of the disruption caused by the tulips is pre- sented as follows: ‘Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river/ Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine’; and in the ﬁnal stanza the poetic speaker compares the water she drinks with that of the sea. Although each of these metaphors works differently from the others, cumula- tively they contribute to the expression of the speaker’s helplessness, (partly voluntary) loss of control, and ambivalent perception of her surrounding environment. Although the studies we have mentioned so far often show a deep awareness of the cognitive functions of metaphor (e.g. Leech, 1969: 158; Nowottny, 1965: 60), they explic- itly focus on metaphor as a linguistic phe- nomenon. Tsur’s (1987, 1992) cognitive poetics, in contrast, employs cognitive the- ories in order to account systematically for ‘the relationship between the struc- ture of literary texts and their perceived effects’ (Tsur, 1992: 1). As far as metaphor is concerned, Tsur aims to explain how the particular characteristics of individual novel metaphors in poetry lead to partic- ular and often unique effects. He claims that metaphorical expressions involve log- ical contradictions which are resolved by cancelling irrelevant features of the vehicle and transferring the remaining features to the tenor (Tsur, 1987: 79ff.; 1992: 209ff.). For example, the expression ‘smiling hooks’ used in reference to smiles in a photograph can be said to involve a logical contradiction between the vehicle (‘hooks’) and the topic (‘smiles’/‘smiling faces’). Resolving the con- tradiction involves cancelling irrelevant fea- tures of the vehicle (e.g. ‘made of metal’) and projecting the remaining features onto the tenor (e.g. ‘causing a forced and painful connection between entities’).\nMETAPHOR IN LITERATURE 235 While Leech (1969) and others are con- cerned with how the use of metaphor is fore- grounded with respect to the use of literal language, Tsur (1987) develops an account of why some literary metaphors are perceived as ‘unmarked’ while others are perceived as ‘marked’. More speciﬁcally, he makes a distinction between metaphors that tend to be perceived as emotive, elevated, or sub- lime, and those that tend to be perceived as witty, ironical, or far-fetched. The for- mer, Tsur argues, draws attention onto the concordant, compatible elements of tenor and vehicle (they have an ‘integrated focus’); the latter, in contrast, draws attention to the incongruity between the tenor and the vehi- cle (they have a ‘split focus’) (Tsur, 1987: 7). Plath’s expression ‘smiling hooks’ comes in the latter category. The choice of ‘hooks’ as a vehicle for smiles emphasizes the contrast between ﬂesh and metal, love and pain, the shape of a smile and the shape of a hook, and so on. This may account for why this metaphor, although effective, may well be perceived by some readers as disturbing and possibly rather forced. The approaches to metaphor in literature we have discussed so far do not all belong to the same tradition, but they have a num- ber of important similarities. Even though all recognize that metaphor is not an exclu- sively literary phenomenon, they emphasize the discontinuity between metaphor in lit- erature and metaphor elsewhere by focus- ing on highly creative, original, and often complex literary examples. Their aim is to investigate the uses of metaphor in particu- lar texts, genres, or authors, and to explain how particular linguistic choices in particu- lar contexts lead to particular effects. They therefore emphasize the uniqueness of each particular use of metaphor in literature, and offer analyses and interpretations that can often be appreciated for their depth and richness regardless of whether one shares the particular scholar’s theoretical assump- tions. These studies also provide extensive accounts of the variety of metaphorical structures that can be found in litera- ture, and of their potential effects. When they consider the relationship between literary and non-literary metaphors, the studies discussed in this section tend to attribute primacy to metaphor in literature, and hence to see metaphors outside litera- ture as largely derivative, and therefore less worthy of investigation. Leech (1969) puts it thus: In the dictum ‘Language is fossil poetry’, Emerson draws our attention to the fact that the expressive power of everyday lan- guage largely resides in countless ‘dead’ metaphors, which have become institution- alized in the multiple meanings of the dictionary. (Leech, 1969: 147) The Continuity between Metaphor in Literature and Metaphor Outside Literature Since the late 1970s, the ‘countless “dead” metaphors’ of everyday language that Leech mentions in the previous quotation have played a central role in the development of the cognitive theory of metaphor by Lakoff and his colleagues (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999; Lakoff & Turner, 1989). As is well known, cognitive metaphor the- orists have shown that ordinary, everyday language is pervaded by patterns of con- ventional metaphorical expressions (e.g. ‘I need a sense of direction’, ‘I am not getting anywhere in life’), and have proposed that these patterns reﬂect systematic metaphor- ical mappings across domains in long-term memory – known as conceptual metaphors (e.g. LIFE IS A JOURNEY). Within this the- ory, metaphor is a ubiquitous and indis- pensable linguistic and cognitive tool, which we use systematically to conceive of our more abstract, subjective experiences (e.g. the workings of our minds), in terms of con- crete, physical experiences (e.g. manipulat- ing physical objects). The rise of cognitive metaphor theory has led to a re-evaluation of the role of metaphor in everyday, non-literary language, and to a new perspective on metaphor in literature. In their study of metaphor in poetry, Lakoff and Turner (1989) claim that the metaphorical expressions produced\n236 ELENA SEMINO AND GERARD STEEN by prestigious poets can often be seen as novel uses of the conventional concep- tual metaphors that also underlie much of our everyday metaphorical language. They argue, for example, that Bunyan’s line ‘As I walked through the wilderness of this world’ in The Pilgrim’s Progress (1965) is a creative realization of the same conventional con- ceptual metaphor (LIFE IS A JOURNEY) that gives rise to many conventional, everyday ways of talking about living one’s life (Lakoff & Turner, 1989: 9–10). More speciﬁcally, they identify four main modes of metaphor- ical creativity in poetry, namely the exten- sion, elaboration, questioning, or combina- tion of conventional conceptual metaphors (Lakoff & Turner, 1989: 67–72). Their main point is that poets challenge and extend the ordinary ways in which we think and express ourselves by using creatively the same metaphorical tools that we all use in everyday language. Contrary to what we noticed in the previous section, therefore, this approach sees metaphor in everyday lan- guage as primary, and metaphor in literature as the creative exploitation of ordinary, non- literary metaphors. In the case of our line from ‘Tulips’, the metaphorical expressions ‘catch onto’ and ‘(smiling) hooks’, although quite novel in context, can be related to a conventional tendency to talk about social and emotional relationships between people in terms of physical connections (e.g. in the expressions ‘the ties of blood relationships’ and ‘the mutual bond of friendship’). On the basis of conventional expressions such as these, K¨ovecses (2000: 94) has proposed that ‘[a] common way to comprehend relationships is through the source domain of PHYSI- CAL LINKS or CONNECTIONS’. Against this background, the expressions ‘Their smiles catch onto my skin’ and ‘little smiling hooks’ can be seen as creative exploitations of the conceptual metaphor (FAMILY) RELATION- SHIPS ARE PHYSICAL LINKS which, in Lakoff and Turner’s (1989) terms, is here creatively elaborated by realizing the notion of ‘phys- ical link’ via the speciﬁc concept of ‘hook’. The speciﬁc choice of the image of hooks catching onto skin, however, heightens the contrast between the source and target con- cepts, and introduces the additional ele- ments of compulsion and pain, which are not normally part of the general conceptual metaphor. In addition, the word ‘hook’ also has a number of conventional metaphorical uses that might be relevant to the genesis and understanding of Plath’s speciﬁc image. As a verb, ‘to hook’ is often used to suggest invol- untary dependence, as in the expressions ‘Some drugs can hook you almost instantly’, and ‘People hooked on horoscopes’ from the British National Corpus. As a noun, ‘hook’ is also used in the idiomatic expression ‘off the hook’, which indicates freedom from a par- ticular duty, responsibility or unpleasant sit- uation. All of this can help to explain why, although the speciﬁc metaphorical expres- sions are quite striking and novel, most readers are likely to agree that they repre- sent the poetic speaker’s perception of the strength and inevitability of her relation- ship with her family, which she is made newly aware of every time she looks at the photograph. This kind of approach accounts primarily for the most basic (and often shared) aspects of readers’ interpretations of speciﬁc literary metaphors. Lakoff and Turner (1989) repeat- edly emphasize this, by referring to the rel- ative ease with which apparently complex literary metaphors can be interpreted by readers (Lakoff & Turner, 1989: 35). Indeed, Lakoff and Turner are not primarily con- cerned with individual examples, texts, or authors in their own right, but with what individual instances of metaphor in liter- ature share with many other metaphori- cal expressions (both literary and everyday) that can be traced back to the same con- ceptual metaphors. This contrasts sharply with the concern for the uniqueness of the structure and effects of each individual use of metaphor which is at the centre of the work by Tsur and others (see Swan, 2002; Tsur, 2000). While, on the one hand, this kind of cognitive approach provides pro- found insights into the relationship between metaphor in literature and metaphor in everyday language, it tends to underestimate the importance of totally novel metaphors,\nMETAPHOR IN LITERATURE 237 which cannot easily be accounted for in terms of conventional patterns and concep- tual metaphors. This applies, for example, to the third stanza of Plath’s poem ‘Morning Song’, where an extended metaphor is used to present motherhood in terms of the rela- tionship between a cloud, the rain, and the wind (see Semino, 1997: 181–182, 220): I’m no more your mother Than the cloud that distils a mirror to reﬂect its own slow Effacement at the wind’s hand. It is important that cognitive metaphor the- orists take proper account of cases such as this, where metaphorical creativity goes well beyond the metaphorical resources of every- day language (and thought). Like cognitive metaphor theory, rele- vance theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1986, 1995) also emphasizes the continuity between metaphor in literature and metaphor in everyday language, as well as between literal and metaphorical language. As Pilkington (2000: 89) puts it, ‘relevance theory holds that metaphorical utterances form a natural part of language use that do not deviate from any norm.’ Within this theory, metaphor- ical utterances, like literal utterances, are produced and comprehended according to the principle of relevance, that is by achiev- ing the best possible compromise between processing effort and interpretative effects. However, creative metaphors of the kind typically found in poetry require additional cognitive effort and yield a wide array of weakly communicated implicatures. This, according to relevance theorists, is what constitutes the essence of what they call ‘poetic effects’ (Pilkington, 2000; Sperber & Wilson, 1986, 1995: 217–223; see also the papers in Language and Literature, vol. 5, no. 3, 1996). From this point of view, Plath’s expression ‘little smiling hooks’, for example, would be interpreted by bringing together the most relevant aspects of our ‘encyclopaedic entries’ for ‘smiling’ and for ‘hooks’. Because these two speciﬁc entries are not normally associated, this would not lead to a small number of ‘strong’ interpretative effects (as would be the case with many literal expres- sions as well as conventional metaphorical expressions), but to a large number of ‘weak’ interpretative effects. While it is problem- atic, in our view, to claim that expressions such as ‘little smiling hooks’ only give rise to weakly entertained interpretative conclu- sions, the notion of ‘poetic effects’ does cap- ture the diffuseness, vagueness, and rich- ness of the interpretations we tend to derive from poetry in particular, and explains all this both in relation to the relevant lin- guistic expressions themselves and to the readers’ willingness to expend greater cog- nitive effort than usual. Relevance theorists, however, frustratingly tend to focus on indi- vidual expressions in isolation and hardly ever produce overall accounts of metaphor- ical patterns in whole texts (e.g. Sperber & Wilson, 1986: 237ff.; Vicente, 1996). On the face of it, it is hard to reconcile the approaches to metaphor in literature we have discussed in this section with those we discussed in the previous section. Indeed, the mutual attacks (and partial misrepresen- tations) of the main proponents of the differ- ent approaches do little to promote dialogue and convergence (e.g. Lakoff & Turner, 1989: 110ff.; Tsur, 2000). However, we hope to have shown that, in spite of sometimes pro- found theoretical differences, each approach can contribute in signiﬁcant ways to our understanding and appreciation of the work- ings of metaphor in literature. While it is important to recognize the different struc- tures and potential effects of metaphor in literature and the unique characteristics of each individual example, it is also crucial to appreciate the strength of the connections between creative and conventional uses of metaphor. The short analyses of the quota- tion from ‘Tulips’ that we have carried out according to each different approach do not come to totally incompatible conclusions, but partly complement each other by elu- cidating different aspects of Plath’s choice of metaphor. Lakoff and Turner’s approach, for exam- ple, explains the most basic, automatic, and widely shared aspects of readers’\n238 ELENA SEMINO AND GERARD STEEN understanding of Plath’s metaphorical ex- pressions. It also explains why she might have chosen ‘hooks’ as a vehicle for the strength of familial relationships, rather than ‘hammers’, for example. On the other hand, however, the line is salient and striking pre- cisely because of the uniqueness and orig- inality of the choices Plath made, both within the line itself and in the rest of the poem. While the formalist view of metaphor as linguistic deviation can no longer be sustained, the idea that some metaphorical expressions are more fore- grounded than others remains highly rele- vant, and is not at all incompatible with more recent cognitive approaches. The expres- sions that are linguistically conventional in the sense of Lakoff and his colleagues are less likely to be foregrounded unless they are put into deliberately metaphorical for- mulae, such as A is B simile, or analogy. Novel linguistic metaphors, by contrast, are likely to be foregrounded precisely because they are unconventional (either in purely linguistic terms or both linguistically and conceptually). In addition, Tsur’s various dimensions of markedness for metaphors explain why some novel metaphors may be more foregrounded (or ‘marked’) than others. Overall, therefore, we agree with Swan (2002) that the ‘disciplinary commitment’ of cognitive metaphor theory ‘to describe what is regular, invariant, and generalizable across an open-ended sample of instances’ does not necessarily have to ‘prevent a cog- nitive approach to metaphor from join- ing a description of its systematic struc- ture with accounts of particular, situated, acts of meaning’ (Swan, 2002: 450–451). In our view, this actually applies to the study of metaphor generally: when investigating authentic uses of metaphor, it is always important to consider both the speciﬁcity of individual expressions in context and their relationship with large, conventional pat- terns in a particular genre, discourse, or lan- guage. To illustrate how this is possible, we shall now discuss a number of recent stud- ies on the use and function of metaphor in literature. The Uses and Functions of Metaphor in Literature While metaphor theorists have recently highlighted the presence of general metaphorical patterns within or even across languages, literary scholars tend to focus on the role of speciﬁc metaphorical patterns within particular literary genres or texts, or in the works of individual authors. This is an idiographic approach to metaphor which highlights the particular and the speciﬁc of a particular metaphorical use or pattern, while making a number of tacit assumptions about what is more general and normal for metaphor in and outside literature, either on the basis of the continuity or the discontinuity position discussed earlier. We shall illustrate these idiographic possibilities for research on metaphor in literature, which are mainly devoted to an explication of how metaphor in literature can work. We will then come back to their relation with the more general approaches to metaphor in literature in the last section. In an inﬂuential study, Lodge (1977) attempts to demonstrate that the opposition between metaphor and metonymy (as pro- posed by Roman Jakobson) can account for the differences between different modes of discourse, genres, literary schools, authors, texts, and parts of texts. While there are many difﬁculties with Lodge’s claims, he undeniably provides insightful observations on differences in the frequencies and uses of metaphor in poetry as opposed to prose, as well as, for example, modernist writing as opposed to realistic and anti-modernist writing. More recently, a number of studies have considered the uses and functions of metaphor in speciﬁc genres. Crisp (1996), for example, argues that the prototypi- cal property of Imagist poetry is the use of metaphorical expressions that realise what Lakoff and Turner (1989) call ‘image metaphors’, metaphors that involve the mapping of visual images rather than con- cepts. In the following lines from Hulme’s well-known poem ‘Autumn’, a simile is used\nMETAPHOR IN LITERATURE 239 to map the visual image of a human face onto that of the moon: I walked abroad, And saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedge Like a red-faced farmer. Crisp argues that the use of image metaphors such as this results from a rejection of abstract concepts and a commitment to pro- duce poems that are focused on concrete, visually perceptible objects. More speciﬁ- cally, the preference for image metaphors rather than conceptual metaphors reﬂects the literary agenda of poets such as Ezra Pound and T. E. Hulme, for whom ‘metaphor, far from being conceptual, is anti-conceptual, presenting an experience of the uniquely individual inaccessible to general concepts’ (Crisp, 1996: 83). Similar studies of the uses of metaphor that are char- acteristic of particular literary genres have recently been conducted on Japanese haikus (Hiraga, 1999), science ﬁction and fantasy novels for young adults (Walsh, 2003), and ﬁctional and non-ﬁctional accounts of ‘split self’ experiences (Emmott, 2002). Traditionally, literary scholars have been even more concerned with how individual authors use metaphor in their works, and have treated metaphorical patterns as an important part of a writer’s style and literary agenda. Lodge (1977), for example, claims that Philip Larkin privileged metonymy over metaphor in his poems as a reaction to the style of poets such as Dylan Thomas – ‘a metaphoric writer if ever there was one’ (Lodge, 1977: 213). He also describes the development of Virginia Woolf’s writing towards experimentation and modernism as a move from a metonymic to a metaphoric style. More recently, scholars inﬂuenced by cognitive metaphor theory have started to regard metaphorical patterns not simply as part of a writer’s individual style but also as a reﬂection of his or her individual world- view. Margaret Freeman (1995, 2000), for example, has argued that Emily Dickinson’s poetry is characterised by metaphorical pat- terns that reﬂect the dominance of a set of partly idiosyncratic conceptual metaphors, such as LIFE IS A VOYAGE IN SPACE. These metaphors contrast with the culturally dom- inant conceptual metaphors of the time, and combine to create what Freeman calls Dick- inson’s ‘conceptual universe’. Similar stud- ies have been conducted on W. H. Auden’s use of personiﬁcation (Hamilton, 1996) and Gerald Manley Hopkin’s use of metaphors to mediate between the material and the tran- scendent (Sobolev, 2003). This focus on individual language use is of course characteristic of literary studies but also raises the more general issue of metaphor’s role in individuals’ idiolects and personal worldviews. As K¨ovecses (2002: 193–195; 2005: 106ff.) has pointed out, our everyday experience suggests that differ- ent people use metaphor in (partly) dif- ferent ways, but this ‘individual variation’ has so far received little attention on the part of metaphor scholars. This is not just a problem in studies of literary metaphor but also holds for studies of the cognitive representation of metaphor in cognitive lin- guistics and cognitive psychology (Blasko, 1999). The acme of the idiographic approach concerns the use of metaphor in individ- ual literary texts, from all three main lit- erary genres. Here scholars are primarily concerned with the text’s speciﬁc effects and achievements, and particularly with the way in which metaphorical choices and patterns contribute to convey particu- lar themes, atmospheres, and worldview(s). There are three competing and well-known analyses of Shakespeare’s sonnet 73, for example, which attempt to explain the com- plex and ambivalent effects of Shakespeare’s choice and juxtaposition of metaphors for aging and death (Lakoff & Turner, 1989: 26ff.; Nowottny, 1965: 76ff.; Tsur, 1987: 155ff.). Other notable recent studies of salient metaphorical patterns in individual poems are Deane’s (1995) analysis of Yeats’ ‘The Second Coming’ and Crisp’s (2003) discussion of Lawrence’s ‘The Song of a Man Who Has Come Through’. In both cases, the focus is on how creative uses of\n240 ELENA SEMINO AND GERARD STEEN conventional conceptual metaphors result in particular representations of speciﬁc situa- tions and experiences. Metaphorical patterns have also been shown to be signiﬁcant to the interpre- tation of literary narratives. In his discus- sion of sustained metaphors (or ‘mega- metaphors’) in novels, Werth (1994, 1999: 23ff.) identiﬁes the intricate metaphorical patterns used in Forster’s A Passage to India to express a particular view of the dif- ferent types of people living in colonial India, including their characteristics, their mutual power relationships, and their rela- tionship with the natural world. In her study of 1984, Simon-Vandenbergen (1993) argues that Orwell exploits conventional conceptual metaphors to create pervasive metaphorical patterns that contribute to the overall meaning of the novel and particu- larly to the creation of ‘the image of a society which is frightening in its perfect coherence’ (Simon-Vandenbergen, 1993: 181). Popova has shown the centrality of metaphori- cal patterns in Patrick S¨uskind’s Perfume (Popova, 2002) and in Henry James’s The Figure in the Carpet (Popova, 2003). Interest- ingly, her analysis of metaphors in The Fig- ure in the Carpet also aims to account for how different groups of literary critics have arrived at contrasting interpretations of the novel. The use of metaphor in individual plays has received comparatively less attention, with the notable exception of Shakespeare’s works. In a series of inﬂuential studies, Don- ald Freeman has argued that individual plays by Shakespeare are dominated by linguis- tic realisations of particular sets of conven- tional conceptual metaphors. According to D. C. Freeman (1995), for example, Mac- beth is pervaded by metaphorical expres- sions drawing from the source domains of PATH and CONTAINERS, which are cen- tral to the way in which the play’s main character and plot are constructed by the writer and comprehended by readers (see also Freeman, 1999, on Anthony and Cleopa- tra). Like other scholars working within cog- nitive metaphor theory (e.g. Popova, 2002), Freeman presents his analyses as evidence of the validity of the theory and of its power to put literary criticism on a ﬁrmer empirical footing (but see Downes, 1993, for a critique of this approach). Several studies have focused on how metaphorical patterns can contribute to the projection of the worldviews of individ- ual characters in both novels and plays (e.g. Lodge, 1977; Black, 1993). Semino and Swindlehurst (1996), for example, show how the idiosyncratic ‘mind style’ of the pro- tagonist (and ﬁrst-person narrator) in Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is reﬂected in the consistent and creative use of conven- tional conceptual metaphors drawing from the source domain of MACHINERY. Similarly, Semino (2002) argues that Clegg’s patho- logical worldview in Fowles’s The Collector results from his unconventional metaphori- cal conceptualisation of women (and other aspects of reality) in terms of insects gener- ally and butterﬂies in particular. In the fol- lowing extract, for example, Clegg expresses his reaction to observing from a distance Miranda – the woman he has become infat- uated with: Seeing her always made me feel like I was catching a rarity, heart-in-mouth, as they say. A Pale Clouded Yellow, for instance. I always thought of her like that, I mean words like elusive and sporadic, and very reﬁned – not like the other ones, even the pretty ones. More for the real connoisseur. (Fowles, 1998: 9) In both cases, the character’s dominant source domain comes from areas of expe- rience that they are highly familiar with (Bromden is a trained electrician; Clegg is a passionate lepidopterist). However, in the course of the novel, Bromden pro- gressively reduces the level and nature of his dependence on the MACHINERY source domain, and experiences a dramatic life change; Clegg, in contrast, is unable to re- conceptualise women in a different way after the ﬁrst disastrous experience with Miranda, so that, at the end of the novel, he is about to embark on a repetition of the same expe- rience with another woman.\nMETAPHOR IN LITERATURE 241 A number of studies on Shakespeare’s plays have similarly shown how the con- trasts in different characters’ worldviews can be related to their reliance on different metaphorical conceptualisations of particu- lar domains of experience. Freeman (1993) argues that the lack of mutual understand- ing between Lear and Cordelia in King Lear is due to the fact that they view love and family ties in terms of incompatible con- ceptual metaphors. Barcelona (1995) shows how the language of different characters in Romeo and Juliet suggests that they hold different metaphorical views of romantic love. In all these studies, the focus is once again on patterns in individual metaphor use, and on what they may suggest about individual minds and worldviews. How- ever, here the relevant individuals are ﬁc- tional characters, and metaphor’s role is to contribute to the process of literary characterisation. Literary studies of metaphor are typically idiographic, in that they focus on the use and function of selected metaphors from speciﬁc texts. In some cases, they do not even go beyond the bounds of one text, but we have also illustrated those studies which are concerned with groups of texts, by one author or from one genre. What all of these studies share is their attention to the speciﬁc, particular, or situated meanings and poten- tial effects of a selection of metaphorical expressions. In analyzing these metaphors, assumptions are made about more gen- eral patterns of metaphor in literature, which act as a background against which the metaphors under analysis are assumed to function and sometimes even stand out. With the accumulation of such idio- graphic studies, however, and with the clear presence of the two competing tra- ditions of the continuity and discontinu- ity between literary and non-literary uses of metaphor, it has become increasingly important to address the general relation between metaphor and literature in a direct fashion. This is where we will now turn, in order to suggest some of the future possibilities for the study of metaphor in literature. Metaphor in Literature as Text versus Literature as Cognition As we said at the beginning of this chap- ter, in spite of their differences, all of the approaches we have discussed so far share the assumption that metaphors in literature are more creative and novel than metaphors outside literature. Although intuitively sat- isfying, however, this assumption is rather hard to prove empirically. Pilkington (2000: 119–121) attempts to provide an account of aesthetic value in relation to metaphor within the context of relevance theory, but, in general, authors tend to state, rather than demonstrate, the superior creativity they attribute to literary metaphors. This is especially true since more recent work on metaphor in discourse has also empha- sized the pervasive creativity of everyday, ordinary language. Most of the examples that Fauconnier and Turner (2002) use to exemplify highly complex and imaginative blends are not taken from literature. And in a corpus-based study of informal conver- sations, Carter (1999, 2004) has found fre- quent and systematic uses of original verbal play, including ‘metaphor extension’, that is the creative exploitation of conventional metaphorical expressions. He concludes: The opposition of literary to non-literary language is an unhelpful one, and the notion of literary language as a yes/no cat- egory should be replaced by one which sees literary language as a continuum, a cline of literariness in language use with some uses of language being marked as more literary than others. (Carter, 2004: 69) But even this is an approach which may be too simple, since differences between regis- ters do not appear to be mono-dimensional. Large-scale corpus work on register varia- tion has shown that, even at a purely for- mal level, registers vary on many dimensions (Biber & Conrad, 2001). When semantic and other properties of metaphor in literary ver- sus non-literary discourse are included as well, the overall picture becomes too com- plex for useful reduction to a single param- eter (cf. Steen, 1999; Steen & Gibbs, 2004).\n242 ELENA SEMINO AND GERARD STEEN Answering the questions we raised above eventually requires quantitative comparison of metaphor use across different (literary and non-literary) genres. This is an area where very little work has been carried out so far, since literary scholars normally support their claims by means of general argumentation and the analysis of selected extracts (e.g. Lodge’s [1977] comparison of different gen- res and types of writing on the basis of Jakob- son’s distinction between metonymic and metaphoric modes of writing). A notable exception is Goatly (1997), who has com- pared the use of metaphor in samples from six different genres (in English). Amongst other things, he has found that modern lyric poetry has a larger percentage of active and extended metaphors than other genres, both literary (e.g. modern novels) and non- literary (e.g. conversation and news reports). This provides some statistical support for Lodge’s (1977) claims that literary language is more metaphorical than non-literary lan- guage, and that poetry is more metaphori- cal than prose ﬁction. However, much more work needs to be done in this area, both in terms of modelling the relevant dimen- sions of metaphor (Steen, 1999), method- ology (e.g. Crisp, Heywood, & Steen, 2002; Heywood, Semino, & Short, 2002; Steen, 2002a, 2002b, 2005) and in terms of the size and variety of the data samples. Some point- ers to research attempting to address these issues may be made here. One problem with Goatly’s study of metaphor in literary and non-literary texts is its reliability: he did the identiﬁcation and analysis of the metaphors by himself, with- out testing the quality of his performance. This is a typical problem in poetic and lin- guistic analyses of metaphor, where analysts tend to engage on an individual basis with their object of investigation. One way to improve this aspect of the study of metaphor in literature is to carry out the analysis with more than one researcher, reporting degrees of agreement between independent analyses. For instance, Shen (1995) inves- tigated the directionality of metaphorical mappings for similes in poetry, assuming that poetic mappings might differ from non-literary mappings in that they might also include mappings from abstract to con- crete and from non-salient to salient (instead of the other way around, as is the overall ten- dency for metaphor). He found that, even in poetry, the more ‘natural’ and ‘comprehen- sible’ patterns are more frequent. What is most important about Shen’s study in the present context, however, is that the data were examined for agreement between four independent analysts. Kreuz et al. (1996) adopted a similar procedure for a study of the co-occurrence between metaphor and a number of other ﬁgures of speech in litera- ture. An alternative approach to the compar- ison between metaphor in and outside lit- erature is to make use of informants. This is an approach which is even less custom- ary in literary studies because it leaves the object of study to people who are not liter- ature scholars (but see Schram and Steen, 2001). However, it has been applied with some success in other approaches. Thus, Katz et al. (1988) present norms for 204 lit- erary and 260 non-literary metaphors on 10 psychological dimensions, which are based on judgments by 634 informants regarding, for instance, their degree of ease of compre- hension, metaphoricity, imageability, and so on. Their data do not indicate substantial differences between the literary and non- literary samples. Yet, even though these data are reliable, as indicated by the appropriate measure, there are various other method- ological problems with the study, which led to further work reported in Steen (1994). His studies did indicate differences between literary and journalistic metaphors on vari- ous dimensions for two languages, English and Dutch. In particular, literary metaphors were found to be more difﬁcult, more pos- itively valued, more impolite, and more unbiased than journalistic metaphors (1994: 202). The methodological problems previously invoked are part of an even more encompass- ing issue which has frustrated research on metaphor in literature, namely the distinc- tion between doing research on metaphors in texts versus on their interpretation by\nMETAPHOR IN LITERATURE 243 readers. In literary studies, the distinc- tion between text and interpretation is fraught with theoretical and even ideological problems (e.g. Kreuz and MacNealy, 1996; Schram & Steen, 2001). In linguistic studies of metaphor, the cognitive turn has led to an approach to metaphor and its cognitive import which has confounded use, function, and effect in ways which are unacceptable to psycholinguists and other social scientists (Steen, 1994; Steen & Gibbs, 1999). After all, metaphor in literature may be distinct because of its properties and distribution in literary versus non-literary texts, it may be distinct because of its special treatment by its authors and readers, or it may be dis- tinct because of an interaction between these two parameters. We shall therefore conclude our discussion of challenges to the study of metaphor in literature with some brief com- ments about this area of research. If the expectations that metaphors in lit- erary texts are, on average, different than metaphors in other texts can be conﬁrmed by more solid evidence, this leads to how these differences as well as the underly- ing variation are handled by readers when they process literary texts. When we adopt Gibbs’s distinction between metaphor com- prehension, recognition, interpretation, and appreciation (e.g. Gibbs, 1994), it is strik- ing that not much work has been done on the ﬁrst seconds of the comprehension of metaphor in literature. A study of the recog- nition, interpretation, and appreciation of metaphors, however, is available from Steen (1994; cf. Glicksohn, 1994; Goodblatt & Glicksohn, 2002). It generally showed that readers pay more attention to metaphors in literature than to metaphors in journalism in various ways. One aspect of this ﬁnding con- cerned readers’ consciously experiencing metaphors as a typically literary rather than a journalistic device, as was shown by two studies using an underlining task (Steen, 1994: 50ff.). This may be attributed to the greater attention and value which readers are expected to attach to the language of lit- erature (e.g. Zwaan, 1993). Another aspect of this increased attention to metaphor in literature concerns the number of times readers perform particular cognitive oper- ations in comparison with journalism. Aspects of Gibbs’s processes of recognition, interpretation, and appreciation were all analyzed in the data collected by means of a think-aloud task, and the results consis- tently pointed to a higher incidence of these processes for the literary text than for the journalistic text. This even held across two groups of readers where one group may be designated as expert, while the other may be designated as non-expert. And metaphor difﬁculty and positive or negative emotive value were shown to inﬂuence the average incidence of these processes in various ways, both within and between the domains of literature and journalism. Attention to metaphor in literature is therefore not just due to the attitude of the reader. It interacts in highly speciﬁc and diverging ways with properties of metaphor. The two variables of difﬁculty and value examined in Steen (1994) indicate the com- plexities that may be expected when we turn to the full range of ‘literary’ properties of metaphor traditionally invoked by scholars of metaphor in literature. In recent work, this approach has been extended beyond what is traditionally regarded as literary, to include the linguistic forms, conceptual structures, and communicative functions of metaphor in discourse (Steen, 2004). An underlining task showed that proper- ties relating to each of these dimensions of metaphor can inﬂuence the recognition of metaphor, to the effect that, for instance, metaphorically used nouns are recognized more often than metaphorically used verbs, or that metaphorically used words at the beginning or an end of a paragraph are recog- nized more often than those in the middle. Conclusions As we have shown, the study of metaphor in literature raises an issue that is very famil- iar to literary scholars: the complexity of the relationship between uses of language that are regarded as ‘literary’ and uses of language\n244 ELENA SEMINO AND GERARD STEEN that are regarded as ‘non-literary’. Further research is clearly needed into the differ- ences between the use of metaphor in liter- ature and elsewhere, and between responses to metaphor uses in literature and in non- literary genres. Importantly, however, the study of creative uses of metaphor in lit- erature highlights the issue of metaphorical creativity more generally, which is relevant to all metaphor scholars: creative uses of metaphor are not conﬁned to literature but can be found across many contexts and dis- courses, from informal conversation through political speeches to scientiﬁc articles. This leads to questions about the characteris- tics, triggers, and functions of metaphor- ical creativity in discourse generally. An analysis of what counts as metaphorical cre- ativity cannot simply be based on a gen- eral notion of deviation, but even the four types of creativity proposed in Lakoff and Turner (1989) do not do justice to the variety and complexity of metaphorical phenomena that can be encountered in discourse, both literary and non-literary. In addition, more research is needed into the contexts in which metaphorical creativity is encountered, and into the functions that creative metaphorical expressions may perform (re-conceptuali- sation, humour, increased intimacy, and so on). In the course of the chapter, we have also emphasized how the study of metaphori- cal uses of language, in literature and else- where, needs to take into account both the unique characteristics of particular uses in context, and the way in which particu- lar uses relate to general conventional pat- terns, that may reﬂect shared cognitive struc- tures and processes. On the other hand, the study of metaphor in literature brings to the fore the importance of studying varia- tion in metaphor use at the level of indi- vidual speakers and writers. While cogni- tive metaphor theory in particular relates conventional metaphorical patterns in a lan- guage to shared cultural and cognitive mod- els, many studies of metaphor in literature relate distinctive, idiosyncratic metaphorical patterns in a writer’s works, a single text, or parts of a text to an individual’s particular cognitive habits, concerns, goals, and world- view. As K¨ovecses (2002: 193–195; 2005: 106ff.) points out, this is an area where fur- ther research is needed, not just in rela- tion to literature but also to real-life dis- course. Only then can the special as well as the general qualities of metaphor in lit- erature be described in contrast with the properties of metaphor in other domains of discourse. As we have shown, this needs to take into account general methodologi- cal norms of sociolinguistics (as in studies of register variation) and psycholinguistics (as in experimental studies of text process- ing). This is essential for the further study of metaphor in literature as an individual reading process along lines of investigation which can also do justice to research on metaphor in psychology and the other social sciences.

While the body is a potentially universal source for emerging metaphors, culture functions as a ﬁlter that selects aspects of sensori- motor experience and connects them with subjective experiences and judgments for metaphorical mappings. That is, metaphors are grounded in bodily experience but shaped by cultural understanding. Put dif- ferently, metaphors are embodied in their cultural environment. To demonstrate how body and culture interact to result in the emergence of metaphors, I focus on the body-part terms for “face” in Chinese and English, which are used through metonymic and metaphoric extension to structure con- cepts that are more abstract. I will show that the newer version of conceptual metaphor theory, with a decompositional analysis based on the distinction between primary and complex metaphors, can help us gain insights into metaphorical compounds in terms of what components they may have and how these components are combined into more complex structures. Primary and Complex Metaphors Cognitive semantics maintains that our minds are embodied in such a way that our conceptual systems draw largely upon the peculiarities of our bodies and the speciﬁcs of our physical and cultural environments (e.g., Gibbs, 1994, 2003; Johnson, 1987, 1999; Lakoff, 1987, 1993; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999). In Metaphors We Live By (1980), Lakoff and Johnson argue that conceptual metaphors, which structure our conceptual systems to a signiﬁcant extent, are not arbi- trary, but grounded in our physical and cul- tural experience. While they emphasize the importance of “direct physical experience,” or embodied experience, as part of the expe- riential basis of conceptual metaphors, they also point out that such experience (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 57): is never merely a matter of having a body of a certain sort; rather, every experience 247\n248 NING YU takes place within a vast background of cul- tural presuppositions. . . . Cultural assump- tions, values, and attitudes are not a con- ceptual overlay which we may or may not place upon experience as we choose. It would be more correct to say that all experi- ence is cultural through and through, that we experience our “world” in such a way that our culture is already present in the very experience itself. Empirical studies of conceptual meta- phors have revealed that some of them are potentially universal, others widespread, and still others culture-speciﬁc (see K¨ovecses, 2005, for a detailed discus- sion). While conceptual metaphor theory accounts for such variations in universality and culture-speciﬁcity in general terms of interaction between body and culture (e.g., Gibbs, 1999, 2003), which constitutes the experiential basis of conceptual metaphors, the question still remains, however, as to how such experiential basis actually works. In other words, the question is how, exactly, the interplay between body and culture gives rise to conceptual metaphors that are universal, widespread, or culture-speciﬁc. In order to answer that question, the newer version of conceptual metaphor the- ory puts forth a “decomposition” account based on the distinction between two kinds of conceptual metaphors: primary metaphors and complex metaphors (see Grady, 1997a, 1997b, 1998; Grady, Taub, & Morgan, 1996; see also Gibbs, Lima, & Francozo, 2004; K¨ovecses, 2002, 2005; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999, 2003). In short, as argued, primary metaphors derive directly from our experi- ence and very often from our common bod- ily experience and therefore are more likely to be universal, whereas complex metaphors are combinations of primary metaphors and cultural beliefs and assumptions and, for that reason, tend to be culture-speciﬁc. More speciﬁcally, the decompositional approach to the analysis of conceptual metaphors has an important implica- tion, namely the judgment of conceptual metaphors in terms of their universality and cross-cultural variation. Primary metaphors, as primitives that “represent metaphorical conceptualization of the most fundamental sort” (Grady, 1997b, 285–286) and that com- pose compounds of complex metaphors, are “the metaphors with the most direct motivation, and the least arbitrary structure, and should therefore be the most common cross-linguistically” (Grady, Taub, & Mor- gan, 1996, 186). As Grady (1997b, 288) fur- ther points out, it is expected that primary metaphors “have the widest cross-linguistic distribution. Since they arise directly from experience – and in many cases, from the bodily experience of the world shared by all humans – they are more likely to be univer- sal than the more complex metaphors which are combinations of them.” In their formulation of a newer version of conceptual metaphor theory, Lakoff and Johnson (1999) suggest that the decompo- sition account, as part of the integrated theory, has shed some new light on the question of which metaphors are universal (or at least widespread) and why. Drawing upon the distinction between primary and complex metaphors, they explain that com- plex metaphors are “molecular,” made up of “atomic” metaphorical parts called pri- mary metaphors (p. 46; see pp. 50–54 for a list of common primary metaphors). Pri- mary metaphors are derived directly from experiential correlations, or “conﬂations in everyday experience” that “pair subjective experience and judgment with sensorimo- tor experience” (p. 49). For example, Lakoff and Johnson (1999, 54) suggest that the pri- mary metaphor MORE IS UP “is embodied in three important ways. First, the correlation arises out of our embodied functioning in the world, where we regularly encounter cases in which More correlates with Up. Second, the source domain of the metaphor comes from the body’s sensorimotor system. Finally, the correlation is instantiated in the body via neural connections.” AS they argue, primary metaphors, as conceptual mappings via neu- ral connections, are part of the cognitive unconscious. We acquire them automatically and uncon- sciously via the normal process of neural learning and may be unaware that we\nMETAPHOR FROM BODY AND CULTURE 249 have them. We have no choice in this pro- cess. When the embodied experiences in the world are universal, then the corre- sponding primary metaphors are univer- sally acquired. (Lakoff & Johnson, 56) In contrast, complex metaphors, “formed by conceptual blending” (Lakoff & Johnson, 46), are “built out of primary metaphors plus forms of commonplace knowledge: cultural models, folk theories, or simply knowledge or beliefs that are widely accepted in a cul- ture” (p. 60). Thus, they (Lakoff & Johnson, 2003, 257) suggest: Inevitably, many primary metaphors are universal because everybody has basically the same kinds of bodies and brains and lives in basically the same kinds of envi- ronments, so far as the features relevant to metaphor are concerned. The complex metaphors that are com- posed of primary metaphors and that make use of culturally based conceptual frames are another matter. Because they make use of cultural information, they may differ sig- niﬁcantly from culture to culture. For instance, Lakoff and Johnson (1999, 60–61) suggest that the complex metaphor A PURPOSEFUL LIFE IS A JOURNEY is com- posed of the following cultural belief (refor- mulated here as two propositions) and two primary metaphors: PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE PURPOSES IN LIFE PEOPLE SHOULD ACT SO AS TO ACHIEVE THEIR PURPOSES PURPOSES ARE DESTINATIONS ACTIONS ARE MOTIONS Whereas the two primary metaphors (PUR- POSES ARE DESTINATIONS and ACTIONS ARE MOTIONS), based on common bodily experience, are likely to be universal, the complex metaphor (A PURPOSEFUL LIFE IS A JOURNEY) is less so. This is because its validity in a particular culture depends on this culture’s holding the combination of the two propositions (PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE PURPOSES IN LIFE and PEOPLE SHOULD ACT SO AS TO ACHIEVE THEIR PURPOSES) and the two primary metaphors, as listed above. In what follows, I discuss how the interac- tion between body and culture contributes to the emergence of metaphors. I will argue that, for conceptual metaphors, body is a source, whereas culture is a ﬁlter. That is, while body is a potentially universal source domain from which bodily-based metaphors emerge, culture serves as a ﬁlter that only allows certain bodily experiences to pass through so that they can be mapped onto certain target-domain concepts. I will do so by focusing on the face, a part of the body, and outline how ﬁgurative expres- sions involving the body-part terms for “face” in Chinese and English emerge from the interplay between some biological facts about, and cultural understanding of, the face. Body as a Source for Emerging Metaphors It needs to be pointed out that, from cog- nitive linguistic perspective, “the distinc- tion between metaphor and metonymy is scalar, rather than discrete: they seem to be points on a continuum of mapping pro- cesses” (Barcelona, 2000a, 16). Metonymy may be a more fundamental cognitive phe- nomenon than metaphor, and, in many cases, metaphor may be motivated by metonymy (Barcelona, 2000b, 2002; Panther & Radden, 1999; Radden, 2002, 2003). To put it dif- ferently, metonymy very often is the link between bodily experience and metaphor in the mapping process from concrete experience to abstract concepts: bodily experience →metonymy →metaphor → abstract concepts. As Dirven (2002, 11) points out, the cognitive theory of metaphor is “revolutionary” in that it is intimately linked to two major claims: (i) the expe- rientialist, bodily basis of metaphor and metonymy and (ii) the universalist basis for conceptual metaphors and metonymies. Apparently, this experientialist and uni- versalist basis of metaphor is constructed around the core of human body.\n250 NING YU Table 14.1: Senses associated with the body part of face in English and Chinese English Chinese Relevant senses associated with the body part of face face lian mian 1. front of head from forehead to chin + + + 2. a look on the face as expressing emotion, character, etc. + + + 3. front, upper, outer, or most important surface of something + + + 4. outward appearance or aspect; apparent state or condition + + 5. composure; courage; conﬁdence; effrontery + + + 6. dignity; prestige + + + 7. have or turn the face or front towards or in a certain direction + + 8. meet conﬁdently or deﬁantly; not shrink from; stand fronting + + Our body plays a crucial role in our creation of meaning and its understand- ing, and our embodiment in and with the physical and cultural world sets out the contours of what is meaningful to us and determines the ways of our understand- ing (Gibbs 1994, 1999, 2003; Gibbs et al., 2004; Johnson 1987, 1999; Lakoff & John- son, 1999). It follows that human mean- ing and understanding are to a consider- able extent metaphorical, mapping from the concrete to the abstract and linking senso- rimotor experience with subjective experi- ence. It also follows that our body, with its experiences and functions, is a poten- tially universal source domain for metaphor- ical mappings from bodily experiences onto more abstract and subjective domains. This is because humans, despite their racial or ethnical peculiarities, all have the same basic body structure, and all share many common bodily experiences and functions, which fundamentally deﬁne us as being human (see also Yu, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003b, 2003c, 2003d, 2004). Sharing this common cognitive foundation of embodi- ment, different languages should have par- allel conceptual metaphors across their boundaries. For instance, my comparative study of body-part terminology shows that the terms for the face in Chinese and English have developed ﬁgurative meanings along similar routes with similar stops, extending from lit- eral through metonymic to metaphoric, as shown in Table 14.1 (Yu, 2001, 25). Such parallel ﬁgurative extensions of the senses of face in English and its two basic coun- terparts lian ‘face’ and mian ‘face’ in Chi- nese, it is suggested, reﬂect the metonymic and/or metaphoric understanding of the face as “highlight of appearance and look,” “indi- cator of emotion and character,” “focus of interaction and relationship,” and “locus of dignity and prestige” (Yu, 2001). They are rooted, as is argued, in some biological facts and functions of the face as part of our body: namely, the face is the most distinc- tive part, on the interactive side, the front, of a person, which as an external body part is most suggestive and expressive of one’s internal world (see Yu, 2001, for a detailed discussion). Since the face is the most distinctive part of a person, we identify or remember peo- ple primarily by their faces. Picture IDs show people’s faces. One thing that stands out in our memory of people is their face. With such a solid experiential basis, little won- der there is a common metonymy in our conceptual systems: FACE STANDS FOR PER- SON. Thus, in both Chinese and English old or new members of a group are referred to as “old or new faces,” as in (1).\nMETAPHOR FROM BODY AND CULTURE 251 (1) a.

Note that in (1a) the Chinese word mian- kong ‘face’ is a compound derived from mian, other such compounds including lian- mian, lian-kong, mian-mao, and yan-mian. As the most distinctive body part that has such features as eyes, brows, nose, and mouth on it, the face is the external part that is the most suggestive or expressive of one’s inner world. One’s feelings can be all “written on one’s face.” For instance, we smile when happy and cry when sad. The reactions to emotions and feelings all show on our faces. These common bodily experiences are expressed as a common con- ceptual metonymy FACE STANDS FOR FEEL- INGS. Given in (2) are some examples. (2) a. Ta bao-zhe renjiade datui he hold-PRT others’ thigh yao zhaogu, yinggai gandao ask-for favor should feel lian-hong face-red ‘Holding others’ thigh asking for favor, he should feel ashamed (lit. face-red).’ b. Ta tai lian-ruan, zongshi he too face-soft always buhaoyisi jujue bieren-de ﬁnd-it-difﬁcult reject others’ yaoqiu demands ‘He’s too soft-hearted (lit. face-soft), always ﬁnding it difﬁcult to reject others’ demands.’ c. He argued until he was blue in the face. d. He’d always wanted to star in action movies but his face just didn’t ﬁt. In (2a), a Chinese example, feeling “face- red” means “feeling ashamed,” whereas in (2c), an English example, the color of “blue in the face” is conventionally associated with the feeling of anger. In both examples, one’s facial expressions stand for one’s feelings, while details of linguistic expressions are furnished by both physiological experiences and cultural beliefs. The examples in (2b) and (2d) are more metaphorical in nature. In both cases, the physical qualities of the face refer to the abstract qualities of the person, namely, personality and character. Hence, the metaphors are PERSONALITY IS FACE and CHARACTER IS FACE. As in (2b), a softhearted person is said to have a “soft face,” whereas in (2d) the “face” that does not “ﬁt” a particular type of role actually refers to the lack of “makings of becoming an action movie star.” By metaphorical extension from the metonymies, the “face” can also refer to the outward appearance of something or apparent state and condition of something abstract. The conceptual metaphors OUT- WARD APPEARANCE IS FACE and APPAR- ENT STATE IS FACE are extensively man- ifested in both Chinese and English. For example: (3) a. Tamen juexin gaibian they are-determined change shan-cun mian-mao. mountain-village’s face ‘They are determined to change the face of the mountain village.’ b. Gaidui yi gai this team completely changed gong-ruo shou-qiang de offense-weak defense-strong MOD lao mian-kong, zhu-chang yi si old face home-ﬁeld by four bi yi da-sheng ke-dui. to one rout visiting-team ‘This team completely changed its old face of weak offense and strong defense, routing the visiting team four to one on its home ﬁeld.’ c. The whole village presented a face of placid contentment. d. His report put a new face on the matter.\n252 NING YU While the “face” can metonymically stand for the physical appearance of a person, it is then metaphorically mapped onto the out- ward appearance of something, such as a vil- lage as in (3a) and (3c). In (3b) and (3d), the “face” is metaphorically mapped onto the apparent state of something abstract. It refers to the “characteristic playing style” of a soccer team in (3b), and to the “state of affair” of a matter in (3d). Finally, given below are examples that have to do with the metaphorical mappings from the “face” to the feelings of dignity and prestige. It seems that conceptual metaphors DIGNITY IS FACE and PRESTIGE IS FACE exist in both Chinese and English, giving rise to corresponding linguistic expressions in these two languages. Look at the follow- ing sentences in Chinese. (4) a. Chuyu wunai, ta zhihao out-of no-choice he is-forced she-lian xiang ren sacriﬁce-face from others jie qian. borrow money ‘With no option left, he was forced to borrow money from others at the sacriﬁce of his dignity (lit. his face).’ b. Wo xiang qing ni chi wanfan, I want invite you eat dinner ni ken-bu-ken shang-lian? you willing-or-not grant-face ‘I’d like to invite you to dinner. May I have the honor (lit. Are you willing to grant me the face)?’ c. Wo zhidao wode lian xiao, I know my face small shuohua ye bu-dingyong. say-words still not-useful ‘I know I’m just a nobody (lit. have a small face); my words carry no weight.’ d. Kan zai wode bo-mian shang, look at my thin-face on yuanliang ta zhe yici. forgive him this time ‘Looking at my humble face (i.e., for my sake), forgive him this time.’ In (4a) and (4b), “face” (i.e., dignity or prestige) can be “lost” or “gained,” and it can be “transferred” from one person to another. The people who can “grant face” to others must have much prestige and command much respect, as in (4b). In (4c) and (4d), the degree of prestige is conceptualized metaphorically as dimensions of face. Little wonder it is argued that one’s face, as one’s social image, is measurable in terms of how much face one claims from others and how much face people give that person (Ho, 1994). If, as is said, one’s face “is a function of perceived social position and prestige within one’s social network” (Hwang, 1987, 961), that “position” should be capable of quantiﬁcation. In (5) listed are similar examples in English. (5) a. He refused to admit he made a mis- take because he didn’t want to lose face. b. Are the ministers involved more interested in saving face than telling the truth? f. She gained great face with the extraordinary performance. g. He’s a man of considerable face in the local community. In reality, one’s feelings, including feelings of dignity and prestige, tend to show on one’s face. In other words, the concep- tual metaphors DIGNITY IS FACE and PRES- TIGE IS FACE have a metonymic or bod- ily basis and are linked with the concep- tual metonymies FACE STANDS FOR FEEL- INGS, in general, and FACE FOR DIGNITY and PRESTIGE, in particular. The conceptual metaphors here are based on some kind of experiential correlation. The metaphorical link between the feelings of dignity and pres- tige on the one hand and the face on the other is not accidental or arbitrary but rooted in some common bodily experience. That is why we are more likely to see, in various cul- tures, the face rather than, say, hands or feet associated with feelings, even though hands and feet can still represent feelings as part of the body language through gestures. What I presented above is a case of embodied nature of human meaning and understanding. The kind of body we have and how it functions inﬂuence and shape\nMETAPHOR FROM BODY AND CULTURE 253 what and how we can mean and under- stand (see also Yu, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003b, 2003c, 2003d, 2004). In both lan- guages, the semantic extensions are struc- tured by metonymy and metaphor, which in turn are grounded in common bodily experiences. Thus, the common bodily experiences account for the parallel mean- ing extensions between them. Some con- ventionalized expressions are even closely equivalent across the languages. Listed below are some examples. Chinese English beng-lian (stretch-face) pull a long face ban-lian (harden-face) straighten one’s face lou-mian (show-face) show one’s face dang-mian (to-face) to one’s face mian-dui-mian face to face (face-to-face) liang-mian (two-face) two-faced diu-lian (lose-face) lose face baoquan-mianzi save face (keep intact-face) you-lian (have-face) have the face/cheek A question to ask is: If, for instance, the conceptual metaphors DIGNITY IS FACE and PRESTIGE IS FACE are based on certain expe- riential correlation rooted in some common bodily experience, are they universal? My speculation is that they are not. A poten- tial metaphor is not an actual metaphor. It will become an actual metaphor only after it passes through the ﬁlter of the culture. Culture as a Filter for Emerging Metaphors While human body, with its many common bodily experiences, is a potentially universal source for emerging conceptual metaphors structuring abstract concepts, culture, how- ever, functions as a ﬁlter that will only allow certain bodily experiences to emerge and map onto certain target concepts (see, e.g., Yu, 2000, 2003a, 2004). This means that many bodily experiences, though commonly shared by all human beings, may not pass the ﬁlter of culture for metaphorical mappings. As Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 19) state when commenting on the relationship between physical and cultural experience as experi- ential bases for orientational or spatialization metaphors: – Our physical and cultural experience pro- vides many possible bases for spatializa- tion metaphors. Which ones are chosen, and which ones are major, may vary from culture to culture. – It is hard to distinguish the physical from the cultural basis of a metaphor, since the choice of one physical basis from among many possible ones has to do with cul- tural coherence. In arguing for the signiﬁcance of cul- tural basis for metaphors, Gibbs (1999, 155) points out that “embodied metaphor arises not from within the body alone, and is then represented in the minds of individ- uals, but emerges from bodily interactions that are to a large extent deﬁned by the cultural world,” and the “bodily experiences that form the source domains for conceptual metaphors are themselves complex social and cultural constructions.” Cultural mod- els, “in shaping what people believe, how they act, and how they speak about the world and their own experiences,” set up speciﬁc perspectives from which “aspects of embodied experience are viewed as par- ticularly salient and meaningful in people’s lives” (p. 154). In short, “social and cul- tural constructions of experience fundamen- tally shape embodied metaphor” (p. 155). In the past few years, therefore, the impor- tant role of culture in the emergence of conceptual metaphors and their speciﬁc lin- guistic realizations has attracted consider- able attention from metaphor researchers (e.g., Barcelona, 2001; Barcelona & Sori- ano, 2004; Boers, 2003; Boers, Demecheleer, & Eyckmans, 2004; Charteris-Black, 2003; Deignan, 2003; Kimmel, 2004; K¨ovecses, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005; Littlemore, 2003; Low, 2003; Maalej, 2004; ¨Ozcaliskan, 2004; Talebinejad & Dastjerdi, 2005). In the previous section, I argued that the conceptual metaphors DIGNITY IS FACE and PRESTIGE IS FACE are not arbitrary but grounded in some common bodily experi- ence. Their bodily basis, that is, people’s feelings tend to show on their faces, explains\n254 NING YU why there are such metaphors. However, the bodily basis of metaphors is only part of the total experiential basis. It can account for the motivation of a metaphor but does not license its actual selection. The actual selection of a metaphor depends to an important extent on its cultural basis. In this section, I take a decompositional approach to the analysis of DIGNITY IS FACE and PRES- TIGE IS FACE. I will demonstrate that these two, simple as they are, are indeed complex metaphors, constructed out of more com- plicated combinations of primary and com- plex metaphors and metonymies, as well as cultural beliefs and assumptions. As Lakoff and Johnson (1999, 46) suggest, “Complex metaphors are formed by conceptual blend- ing.” At this point, I want to stress that DIG- NITY IS FACE and PRESTIGE IS FACE are really the shorthand for more complicated metaphorical compounds. As such, they consist of multiple components, with each of them being a condition for their selec- tion or realization. Only in those languages that meet all the conditions, which consti- tute what I call the “cultural ﬁlter,” can they exist and be manifested linguistically. That is to say, embodied experience, no matter how universal it is, has to pass through the ﬁlter of culture before it can be mapped metaphori- cally onto abstract concepts. In what follows, I ﬁrst take on the analysis of the complex metaphor DIGNITY IS FACE. As we have seen in the previous section, DIGNITY is not understood merely as FACE. Instead, it is FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT. That is, the source concept is formed by conceptual blending based on a complex metaphor. Look at the following: (6) a. DIGNITY IS A FEELING (a proposi- tion) b. A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a primary metaphor) c. FACE STANDS FOR A FEELING (a metonymy) As indicated in the parentheses next to it, (6a) is a proposition that represents the pre-mapping target-domain concept under- stood as a kind of “feeling.” (6b) is a pri- mary metaphor involving a fundamental metaphorical mapping in our conceptual systems from sensorimotor experience (of manipulating physical objects) to subjective experience (a feeling). (6c) is a metonymy that represents the bodily basis supporting the association and connection of the face with feelings. That is, while dignity is a kind of feeling, a feeling is generally conceptual- ized metaphorically as a physical object and the face metonymically stands for a feeling. Thus, (6b) and (6c) are combined into one complex metaphor, as in (7b): (7) a. DIGNITY IS A FEELING (a proposi- tion) b. FACE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a com- plex metaphor) In (7b), the target concept FACE really stands for A FEELING and the metaphor is about a feeling. For the next step, (7b), a com- plex metaphor, is embedded into the source- domain slot of (7a) to replace A FEELING, so that we have (8a). (8) a. DIGNITY IS (FACE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT) b. DIGNITY IS FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT As (8a) shows, the source-domain concept, placed in the parentheses, is no longer a sim- ple one but a composite one formed by con- ceptual blending. It is a complex metaphor (FACE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT) formed by combining (6b) with (6c) and is embedded into the source-domain slot. So combined, the source-domain concept is neither a sim- ple FACE nor just A PHYSICAL OBJECT, but a blend of both, on top of A FEELING. Thus, (8a) is interpreted as the following: While dignity is a feeling (6a), the face metonymi- cally stands for that feeling (6c), which is also understood metaphorically as a physi- cal object (6b). For the purpose of simplic- ity, we can rewrite (8a) as (8b), to eliminate the parentheses. At a higher level, (8b) is then combined with another, proposition, DIGNITY IS A\nMETAPHOR FROM BODY AND CULTURE 255 DESIRABLE FEELING, which reﬂects the cul- tural belief, and we then have a new complex metaphor as in (9a): (9) a. DIGNITY IS FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSESSION (a complex metaphor) b. DIGNITY IS FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor) c. DIGNITY IS A DESIRABLE FEELING (a proposition) Here (9b) and (9c), which are indented to the right from (9a), represent the two com- ponents of (9a). Since dignity is culturally accepted as a desirable feeling, the face that stands for this feeling now turns from an ordinary physical object into a valuable pos- session. In summary, what we call a conceptual metaphor, DIGNITY IS FACE, is really the shorthand for a complex metaphor (9a) combined from metaphorical, metonymic, and propositional components. Taking a decompositional approach to analysis, I list the whole metaphorical compound and its component elements below in (10): (10) a. DIGNITY IS FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSESSION (a complex metaphor) b. DIGNITY IS FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor) c. DIGNITY IS A FEELING (a proposition) d. FACE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor) e. A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a primary metaphor) f. FACE STANDS FOR A FEEL- ING (a metonymy) g. DIGNITY IS A DESIRABLE FEELING (a proposition) With its metaphorical, metonymic, and propositional components, (10) should rep- resent an important part of the cultural model for the concept of DIGNITY. As a complex metaphor, (10a) is decomposed into the combination of another complex metaphor (10b) and a proposition (10g) rep- resenting the cultural belief. Then, (10b), a complex metaphor itself, is decomposed into two components: (10c) is a proposi- tion presenting the pre-mapping target con- cept, whereas (10d) is another complex metaphor representing the source concept. Note that the source-domain concept itself is a complex metaphor composed of a pri- mary metaphor (10e) and a metonymy (10f). Thus, the source concept is a blended com- posite FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT, where the FACE stands for A FEELING, which in turn is understood as A PHYSICAL OBJECT. The metonymy in (10f) serves as the bodily basis for the whole compound. The ﬁnal complex metaphor (10a) pre- supposes the combination of all the compo- nents in (10b–g). Any change in the num- ber of components and their combinations will change the outcome of the metaphorical compound. For instance, if the metonymy FACE STANDS FOR A FEELING is not selected in a culture, the ﬁnal complex metaphor and its combinations would look different as below: (11) a. DIGNITY IS A VALUABLE POSSES- SION (a complex metaphor) b. DIGNITY IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a primary metaphor) c. DIGNITY IS A FEELING (a proposition) d. A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a primary metaphor) e. DIGNITY IS A DESIRABLE FEELING (a proposition) In this culture, then, “dignity” is conceptu- alized as “a valuable possession,” but it has nothing to do with the “face.” To put the decompositional analysis under perspective, I summarize it as the fol- lowing. The DIGNITY IS FACE metaphor is the shorthand for the complex metaphor DIGNITY IS FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSES- SION (10a), which in turn is a compound of metaphorical, metonymic, and propositional components (10b–g) put together through multilevel substitutions and combinations. So constructed, this compound has a com- plex internal structure with multiple ele- ments. Any change in the number or content of those elements, and in the way they\n256 NING YU are combined, will result in a different compound. Such compounds are assem- bled by cultures. Therefore, the sets of components (metaphorical, metonymic, and propositional) and the ways they are com- bined function as conditions that “shape” the ﬁnal products of complex metaphors. They constitute what I mean by “cultural ﬁlters.” Now I turn to the complex metaphor PRESTIGE IS FACE. As I see it, it shares the similar components and combinations as that for DIGNITY, to an important extent. Thus, (12a–g) below are the same as (10a–g) above, except that the target-domain con- cept now is PRESTIGE. (12) a. PRESTIGE IS FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSESSION (a complex metaphor) b. PRESTIGE IS FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor) c. PRESTIGE IS A FEELING (a proposition) d. FACE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor) e. A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT(a primary metaphor) f. FACE STANDS FOR A FEEL- ING (a metonymy) g. PRESTIGE IS A DESIRABLE FEEL- ING (a proposition) The concept of PRESTIGE differs, however, from DIGNITY in that it involves something more, which is expressed by the following additional metaphor in (13a): (13) a. AMOUNT OF ONE’S PRESTIGE IS SIZE OF ONE’S FACE (a complex metaphor) b. PRESTIGE IS FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor) c. PRESTIGIOUS IS BIG (a primary metaphor) Again, (13a) is decomposed into two com- ponent parts: (13b) and (13c). As a complex metaphor itself, (13b) is the same as (12b), and therefore entails everything in (12c–f), omitted here for simplicity. (13c), PRESTI- GIOUS IS BIG, is a primary metaphor, on a par with IMPORTANT IS BIG. What (13a) entails, supported by (13c), is that “having more prestige is having a bigger face” and “having less prestige is having a smaller face.” Once again, what I called earlier a con- ceptual metaphor PRESTIGE IS FACE is only the convenient shorthand for a compound of metaphors (both complex and primary), metonymies, and propositions that combine into a signiﬁcant part of the cultural model for the concept of PRESTIGE. The complex metaphors analyzed through decomposition in this section as compounds of metaphors, metonymies, and propositions are constructed by a culture (see also Yu, 2003a). Only those cultures that have selected the same components combined in the same way will have the same complex metaphors as in (10a), (12a), and (13a). Although they contain quite strong embodied components, their embodied grounding only accounts for their motivation, whereas their actual selection and combination in a speciﬁc way depend largely on cultural factors. For instance, it is possible to ﬁnd the primary metaphor A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT common, but their speciﬁc-level instances DIGNITY IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT and PRESTIGE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT absent, in a culture. It is possible that such concepts as DIGNITY and PRESTIGE are understood in terms of substances, forces, or locations, rather than objects. If that is the case, the complex metaphors analyzed in this section would not exist in this culture. We can also assume a situation where DIGNITY and PRESTIGE are conceptualized as objects, but not as faces, despite the fact that there exists a robust experiential link between feelings and the face. This is what I mean by saying “culture is the ﬁlter for emerging metaphors.” Not everything in the source can actually emerge for metaphorical mappings. Further Discussion In the previous two sections, I have out- lined the bodily and cultural bases of the\nMETAPHOR FROM BODY AND CULTURE 257 metaphors involving the body-part terms for the “face” in Chinese and English. The bodily basis consists of some biological facts and functions of the face as part of our body. The body-part terms referring to the “face” have developed the ﬁgurative mean- ings that they have because of the functions perceived of, and the values attached to, the face as part of our body. More generally, our body serves as a potentially universal source domain for metaphors. On the other hand, the cultural basis of metaphor consists in its interpretative function, thus viewing certain parts of the body or certain aspects of bodily experience as especially salient and mean- ingful in the understanding of certain abstract concepts. In other words, culture plays a crucial role in linking embodied experiences with subjective experiences for metaphorical mappings. Thus, for instance, in both Chinese and English the face is selected as a source-domain element to par- ticipate in the conceptual integration in the bodily based metaphors for DIGNITY and PRESTIGE. The choice of one aspect from a range of possible bodily experiences for a target concept is a matter of cultural pref- erence. That is, cultural models function as a ﬁlter that lets certain elements from the source domain to be mapped onto the tar- get domain while keeping others from get- ting through. It is worth mentioning in passing that, while I have shown in the previous two sec- tions that both Chinese and English share the conceptual metaphors DIGNITY IS FACE and PRESTIGE IS FACE and some other con- ceptual metaphors and metonymies, I have ignored here some important differences in other aspects between these two languages (see K¨ovecses, 2005, for dimensions of cul- tural variation in conceptual metaphor and its expression). For instance, Chinese and English differ in the extent to which these two conceptual metaphors are linguistically manifested or conventionalized (see Yu, 2001, for a more detailed discussion). Thus, proportionate to the fact that the English word face corresponds to several Chinese body-part terms for “face,” some English idiomatic expressions have multiple Chi- nese counterparts used in different contexts with different emphases. For example, the English idiom lose face corresponds to several Chinese compound words: diu-lian (lose- face), pao-lian (toss-face), qiang-lian (scrape- face), and sao-lian (sweep-face). Here, the last three Chinese examples elaborate on the ﬁrst one by conﬂating the semantic compo- nent of manner in them. The next example shows a different kind of elaboration. The English idiom save face basically means “save one’s own dignity or self-respect.” Equiva- lent to this meaning Chinese has baoquan- mianzi (keep intact-face), that is, “to save one’s own face.” Related to this Chinese also has compounds such as gu-mianzi (consider- face), yao-mianzi (want-face), and ai-mianzi (love-face), referring to people who are “keen on saving their face.” Furthermore, the elaboration also takes a different direc- tion to “saving other people’s face.” There- fore, in Chinese there are compounds like guquan-mianzi (take care to preserve-face), jiang-mianzi (talk-face), ai-mianzi (hindered by-face), liu-mianzi (preserve-face), mai- mianzi (buy-face), gei-lian (give-face), and gei-mianzi (give-face). These examples show that it is important to save not only one’s own face, but also others’ face. Face-saving is more reciprocal in Chinese. Apparently, Chinese is richer than English with conventional expressions involving the body part of face. This linguistic evidence seems to be linked with the fact the con- cept of face, or “social face,” is central to the Chinese construal of their social life. As I have demonstrated in the previous section, the decomposition account based on the distinction between primary and com- plex metaphors is a useful analytical tool. By decomposing more complex metaphor- ical compounds into their primitive com- ponents, we can gain insights into how such metaphorical compounds have come into being through a process of mapping between, and combining of, their basic com- ponents, thus gaining a better sense of their nature of complexity. The decompositonal\n258 NING YU approach also enables us to make more detailed comparisons between conceptual metaphors in and across languages. For example, as I have shown, in both Chinese and English the metaphorical com- pounds for DIGNITY and PRESTIGE are sim- ilar in some ways but different in oth- ers. The similarities and differences between them are displayed by (10), (12), and (13) in section 4, summarized below as three com- plex metaphors: (14) a. DIGNITY IS FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSESSION (a complex metaphor) b. PRESTIGE IS FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSESSION (a complex metaphor) c. AMOUNT OF ONE’S PRESTIGE IS SIZE OF ONE’S FACE (a complex metaphor) As shown in (14a) and (14b), both DIGNITY and PRESTIGE are conceptualized metaphor- ically in terms of a conceptual blending FACE AS A VALUABLE POSSESSION. How- ever, PRESTIGE differs from DIGNITY in that it is also understood in terms of another com- plex metaphor AMOUNT OF ONE’S PRES- TIGE IS SIZE OF ONE’S FACE in (14c). (14c) entails two metaphorical components: (1) PRESTIGE IS FACE AS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a complex metaphor), and (2) PRESTI- GIOUS IS BIG (a primary metaphor). With the decomposition approach based on the distinction between primary and complex metaphors, we are able to break a metaphorical compound into its compo- nents of metaphors (complex and primary), metonymies, and propositions, and distin- guish more bodily-based components from more culturally bound ones. For instance, because DIGNITY and PRESTIGE are cultur- ally accepted as positive feelings, they are thus understood in part as “valuable posses- sions” rather than in more general terms of “physical objects.” Also, because PRESTIGE is culturally regarded as a positive feeling, the amount of one’s prestige becomes directly related to the dimension of one’s “face.” Thus, “larger or thicker faces” are better than “smaller or thinner faces,” and vice versa. In a different case, however, the opposite could be true. Take as an example “shamelessness,” which is also metaphorically understood in part in terms of the “face.” Because it is neg- ative, a “thick-face” is derogatory rather than complimentary. While bodily based elements are more likely to be widespread or even universal, it is not necessarily true that they are univer- sally applicable or activated. It all depends, I believe, on the level of generality at which they exist in the hierarchy of our concep- tual systems. For instance, the metaphori- cal compounds for DIGNITY and PRESTIGE have two bodily based components: FACE STANDS FOR A FEELING (a metonymy) and A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT (a pri- mary metaphor). These two derive directly from our experience. Thus, while FACE FOR A FEELING as a conceptual metonymy is probably widespread or even universal, its two speciﬁc-level instances, FACE FOR DIG- NITY and FACE FOR PRESTIGE, are less likely so. While they are both activated in Chi- nese and English, they may not be active metonymies in other languages. For a further example, look at the following metaphorical hierarchy: Level 1: A MENTAL STATE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT Level 2: A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT Level 3: DIGNITY IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT PRESTIGE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT These four conceptual metaphors all seem to be primary metaphors, but they stay at three different levels of generality that constitute a hierarchical structure. A MENTAL STATE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT is a generic metaphor at the higher level (Level 1). It is the object-dual in binary contrast with the location-dual A MENTAL STATE IS A LOCATION. Thus, for example, “love” as a mental state can be either a location (e.g., to fall in love) or a physical object (e.g., to receive love). An abstract state in general is also con- ceptualized in dual versions. For instance, we can “bring peace and stability to a country,” that is, A STATE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT,or “push that country toward peace and stabil- ity,” that is, A STATE IS A LOCATION, and more speciﬁcally, A DESTINATION (see Yu,\nMETAPHOR FROM BODY AND CULTURE 259 1998, chapter 5 for relevant analyses of Chi- nese examples). At the intermediate level (Level 2), a feel- ing inherits the properties of a mental state as its subcategory (cf. thought, will, etc.), and is also conceptualized as a physical object. At the lower level (Level 3), dignity and prestige are two kinds of feelings (cf. admi- ration, respect, jealousy, humiliation, etc.), and are by inheritance physical objects as well. Therefore, dignity and prestige, like discrete entities, can be “lost” or “gained” and can be “transferred” from one person to another. The four conceptual metaphors at all three levels of hierarchy are likely to vary in terms of universality or culture-speciﬁcity although they may all be primary metaphors. At the higher level, A MENTAL STATE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT, with its high level of abstraction, is likely to be universal (see also Yu, 1998). This is because it sits at the tip of a huge hierarchical pyramid. Linguis- tic instantiations of any number of possible conceptual metaphors at the levels below it can prove its existence in a language and culture. At the intermediate level, A FEEL- ING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT has a lower probability of being universal than A MEN- TAL STATE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT, because feelings are understood metaphorically as substances, forces, temperatures, locations, and so forth, as well as objects. A culture can choose all of them, or any number of them, as the source domains for feelings. For the same reason, DIGNITY IS A PHYSI- CAL OBJECT and PRESTIGE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT at the lower level have an even lower probability of being selected by a culture compared with A FEELING IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT. It seems that there is a direct rela- tionship between the level of generality and the likelihood of universality: as the level of generality goes up, the likelihood of univer- sality increases, and vice versa. Since DIG- NITY IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT and PRESTIGE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT exist at a more spe- ciﬁc level, its likelihood of universality is thus much lower than A FEELING IS A PHYS- ICAL OBJECT, and even lower than A MEN- TAL STATE IS A PHYSICAL OBJECT. Conclusion In sum, metaphor emerges from the inter- action between body and culture. While metaphorical mappings are largely grounded in bodily experience, the choice of one from many possible options in the large pool of bodily experiences depends largely on cultural understanding and interpreta- tion. When cultures have common under- standing and make the same interpretation, constrained by common bodily experi- ences, they are likely to share conceptual metaphors, and vice versa. Also, primary metaphors, derived directly from embod- ied experience, are more likely to be widespread or even universal, whereas com- plex metaphors, composed of more basic metaphoric and metonymic mappings and cultural beliefs and assumptions, are more likely to be culture-speciﬁc. A decompositional analysis based on the distinction between primary and complex metaphors, as demonstrated in this study, equips us with a ﬁne and effective ana- lytical tool for metaphor study. This tool enables us to see which elements of a metaphor are bodily based or culturally bound. As I have analyzed in this study, com- plex metaphors may be conceptual com- pounds with complex internal structures composed of a series of basic elements (i.e., metaphors, metonymies, and propositions) combined with one another at different lev- els. Only those cultures that have selected the same number of basic elements and com- bine them in the same way should have the same conceptual metaphors. In an impor- tant sense, the number of elements and the way they are combined, as selected by a culture, serve as conditions that constrain the construction of metaphors in that cul- ture. It is in this sense that common bodily experiences are “ﬁltered” by culture before they can emerge and map metaphorically onto abstract concepts. It is also in this sense that the decomposition account, as demon- strated in this study, has the potential for a “grammar of metaphors,” which enables us to describe and analyze metaphors, namely, their component elements and the ways that\n260 NING YU combine them, in more subtle and system- atic terms. Since so little empirical research has been done in this area, this summary should not be taken as a conclusion but a hypothesis for future study in a new direction.

Any speech act we perform using lan- guage literally we can also perform with language used, or interpreted, metaphori- cally. Sometimes we make metaphors sim- ply for their poetic power, their beauty, or their aesthetic pleasure. But we also employ metaphors, just like the literal, to elucidate abstract scientiﬁc and mathematical con- cepts and in folk explanations of human actions. And in everyday discourse inter- spersed with metaphors, we make asser- tions, ask questions, and issue commands and requests – just as we do with literal lan- guage. Suppose Romeo actually announced, as he does in the context depicted in Shake- speare’s play, that (1) Juliet is the sun. Although he is surely making us attend to a likeness between Juliet and the sun (David- son, 1984), and possibly inviting us to view her in a certain light (Loewenberg, 1975; Moran, 1989), Romeo is also saying some- thing true or false of Juliet, and this some- thing he is saying – for example, that Juliet is greater than her peers, the center of his life, and the object of his adoration – is not what would be said by (1) literally, namely, that she is a body of gases in the sky. But what he is saying metaphorically is said no differently than the literal contents of other utterances. One can either understand the content of his metaphor or fail to grasp it – just as we can succeed or fail to get a lit- eral content (Bergmann, 1982; Hills, 1997; Moran, 1989; Stern, 2000). Parties can dis- agree over a metaphor, either over what it says or, when they agree on its content, over its correctness. And once we understand the metaphor, we can also judge it to be suc- cessful, appropriate, forceful, or apt. This last judgment call may depend on many criteria, including noncognitive images and affects conveyed by the metaphor. But it will also depend on our grasp of when, or under what conditions, it would be true. Not that we always ﬁnd its actual truth- value what is most interesting or most valuable about the metaphor. But to grasp declarative metaphors, we must know the 262\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 263 circumstances that would render them true, circumstances that are not generally the same ones that would render the sen- tence, interpreted literally, true. In short, metaphorical uses, or interpretations, of sen- tences, no less than literal utterances, have truth-conditions, and those truth-conditions are different from those they would have were they interpreted literally. If truth- conditions are either identical with or deter- mined by meanings, then one sentence ﬁrst used literally and then metaphorically must also have different meanings. All this talk of meaning, truth, and propo- sitional content suggests that metaphor ought to fall within the scope of seman- tics or a theory of meaning. Nonetheless, philosophers, linguists, and cognitive scien- tists have typically been resistant to seman- tic treatments of metaphor. The grounds for resistance have varied over time, and they have also changed as conceptions of seman- tics have changed. In this chapter, I shall concentrate on two contemporary sources of skepticism. The ﬁrst is based on the distinc- tion between what words literally mean and what they can be used to say. The ﬁrst is the domain of semantics, the second of pragmat- ics, and metaphor, it is argued, falls under the second. Here is one argument for this claim. If a metaphorical interpretation of an expres- sion Ø were a kind of meaning, it would be additional to the literal meaning of Ø, thereby rendering Ø ambiguous. But unlike the multiple meanings of genuinely ambigu- ous expressions like “bank” and unlike the meaning of an idiom like “red herring” that is independent of those of its constituents “red” and “herring,” the metaphorical mean- ing of an expression is not independent of its literal meaning – in the sense of “indepen- dent” according to which a speaker can know one without knowing the other.1 A speaker cannot understand what is metaphorically said when Romeo utters (1) without know- ing the literal meaning of “the sun” (and without a variety of beliefs about its literal referent). This dependence is not just a con- tingent diachronic relation about how the metaphorical historically originated from the literal. It is a constitutive claim about the way in which our understanding of a metaphorical interpretation involves our knowledge of its literal meaning. Even while used or interpreted metaphorically, the lit- eral meaning of Ø is active (Davidson, 1984). But if what Ø metaphorically expresses depends on Ø meaning what it does liter- ally, then what Ø metaphorically expresses cannot be something it means, a metaphor- ical meaning. Rather it must be a function of how the speaker uses Ø to say something with but beyond its literal meaning. Hence, metaphor is a matter of pragmatics rather than semantics. A second source for skepticism about the semantic status of metaphor stems from its “context-dependence.” Theorists intend either or both of two things by this slo- gan. First, unlike literal meaning which is individuated by linguistic type, (many) metaphorical interpretations of utterances of the same expression (type) vary widely from one occasion, or context, to another. Second, metaphorical interpretations are a function of all sorts of extra-linguistic pre- suppositions and skills such as the percep- tion of similarities and salient features. For both reasons, it is concluded that metaphor does not fall under the kind of language- speciﬁc knowledge that constitutes semantic competence. In response to these skeptical challenges, I shall argue that a semantic theory of metaphor can and indeed must take into account both its context-dependence and how metaphor depends on the literal. The crux of my explanation is to model the metaphorical interpretation, or use, of lan- guage on the demonstrative interpretation, or use, of language (Kaplan, 1989), that is, to treat metaphors, demonstratives, and indexi- cals (for all their differences) as one semantic kind (Stern, 2000). To show this, I argue ﬁrst that metaphorical interpretations systemat- ically depend on structured sets of contex- tual presuppositions, individuated by their literal vehicles.2 Second, we need meanings for metaphors (in addition to their truth- conditional or propositional interpretations) in order to constrain the extra-linguistic contributions of the context, that is, to\n264 JOSEF STERN constrain the possible metaphorical con- tents we can express with given expressions. These metaphorical meanings will turn out to have the same semantic properties as the meanings of indexicals and demonstratives (or of a hybrid of them). I begin (section 2) with a brief prehistory of semantic accounts of metaphor, both to illustrate how different conceptions of the enterprise of semantics have yielded different semantic theories of metaphor and to motivate our turn to con- text. In section 3, I elaborate the conception of semantics that guides my own theory. In sections 4 and 5, I sketch a semantic the- ory of metaphor by elaborating the different roles of the context in metaphorical inter- pretation and its notion of literal-dependent metaphorical meaning. In the ﬁnal section, I illustrate one kind of cognitive work per- formed by our notion of metaphorical mean- ing above and beyond its truth-evaluable content. 2. The Prehistory of Semantic Theories of Metaphor Semantic theories of metaphor ﬁrst came into vogue in the ﬁfties and sixties in reac- tion to rhetoricians who demoted metaphor to mere stylistic decoration, to logical posi- tivists who dismissed it as meaningless emo- tive venting, and to romanticist critics who celebrated its poetic power to create and express the nondiscursive. Analytic philoso- phers like Max Black (1962), Monroe Beard- sley (1962, 1978), and Paul Henle (1958) sought to rehabilitate metaphor by show- ing that it is cognitively meaningful no less than the literal. However, in the course of their attempts, these philosophers made metaphor appear even “more” cognitive and “more” meaningful than the literal. Black’s “interactionism,” Beardsley’s “metaphorical twist,” and Henle’s “iconicism” endowed metaphors with the capacity to express literally unparaphrasable and inexpressible meanings with a power to (ontologically) create novel similarities and features. The net result made metaphor sui generis, effec- tively insulated from the home domain of the theory of meaning (which continued to concern itself almost exclusively with the literal) and explanatorily occult, less and less distinguishable from the noncogni- tive and nonpropositional views of metaphor the semantic approach was proposed to counter. With the emergence of theoretical lin- guistics in the sixties and seventies, semantic theories of metaphor underwent a renais- sance. Two general strategies can be dis- cerned as theorists tried to revive earlier ideas with their new formal resources. The ﬁrst strategy attempted to explain both the recognition and interpretation of metaphors in terms of the then widely held doctrine that all metaphors are, taken literally, seman- tically anomalous or grammatically deviant (Beardsley, 1962, 1978; Goodman, 1976; Levin, 1977; Matthews, 1971; cf. now White, 2001). This fault of the sentence – the vio- lation of co-occurrence conditions – was taken to exclude its literal interpretation, from which it was concluded that the utter- ance is ipso facto identiﬁed and interpreted as a metaphor. Either a new metaphori- cal sense emerges from secondary connota- tions to which the interpreter shifts when the literal meaning fails; or the metaphorical interpretation is produced as the product of cancellation-, weighting-, and transference- operations performed on components of the lexical entries of the words. On either story, the metaphorical interpretation counts as semantic because it is a function of violations of semantic conditions. All a speaker needs to know in order to recognize and interpret a metaphor are the linguistic or semantic rules the sentence breaks. The fatal ﬂaw of this strategy was its assumption that all, most, or rep- resentative metaphors are grammatically deviant, semantically anomalous, or even just plain false under their literal interpre- tation. In the mid-seventies, this dogma was decisively challenged by numerous counterexamples of “twice-true” metaphors (Binkley, 1976; Cohen, 1975, 1976 [who invented the phrase]; Reddy, 1969). Defend- ers of deviance then made one of two moves. Either they reverted to prag- matic explanations of the unacceptability of the literal interpretation, for example, its\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 265 uninformativeness or irrelevance in its con- text, thereby shifting the proper locale for metaphor away from semantics and mean- ing to pragmatics and use. Or diehard defenders attempted to maintain that, despite appearances, all literal interpreta- tions really are semantically deviant. The problems with this second line of defense are instructive. For example, against purported coun- terexamples to the semantic anomaly the- ory, Eva Kittay (1987) argues that critics fail to correctly identify the literally incongru- ous unit. In some cases, it is an immediate constituent phrase (e.g., Eliot’s “a slum of bloom”), in others the whole sentence, but in yet other cases, it is the utterance-in-its- situational-context. This prima facie prag- matic anomalousness, she in turn argues, is really indicative of an underlying semantic incongruity because all salient elements of a situational context can “be rendered lin- guistically” (62), thereby “placing the iden- tiﬁcation of metaphors squarely within the province of semantics” (75). Consider the sentence (2) (2) The rock is becoming brittle with age (Reddy, 1969), whose subject description is used metaphor- ically to refer to an aging professor. (2) con- tains no semantic or linguistic incongruity. But if we imagine it to be uttered in the sit- uational context which we in turn linguisti- cally represent by (3) (3) He responds to his students’ questions with none of his former subtlety. Then in order for (2) and (3) to cohere conversationally the pronoun in (3) must be anaphorically co-referential with “the rock” in (2). But the latter is [-animate] and the verb “responds” in (3) takes only a [+animate] subject; hence, the “conversion sentence” (4) that links the antecedent in (2) with its anaphor in (3): (4) The rock is he. And (4) is semantically anomalous. QED This may be a possible description of an interpreter’s reasoning but it does not offer a semantic explanation of either the identiﬁ- cation or interpretation of the metaphor in (2). Granting the co-reference captured in (4), it remains to be shown that the pronoun is a linguistically controlled anaphor rather than a demonstrative whose referent would be determined in part extra-linguistically. Furthermore, the conversational coherence that drives the anaphoric linking is prag- matic. Hence, there need be no semantic connection between (2) and (3). The fact that (4) involves an incongruity does nothing to explain away (2) as a counterexample to the deviance thesis. In sum, context may be crucial to both the identiﬁcation and inter- pretation of a metaphor, but one must be cautious when incorporating it into seman- tics not to rob it of its explanatory power (Beardsley, 1978; Stern, 1983). The second semantic strategy that emerged in the ﬁfties and sixties attempted to cash out metaphorical–literal depen- dence by assigning to each expression a set of component features (“selectional features” or “semantical hypotheses”) as its lexical entry, by identifying that set with its literal meaning, and then deriving its metaphorical interpretations by canceling or deleting one or another feature in the set, ipso facto highlighting the remaining ones. Thus, “the metaphorical meanings of a word . . . are all contained . . . within its literal meaning . . . reached by removing any restrictions in relation to certain variables” (Cohen, 1993; Cohen & Margalit, 1972, 735). The speaker who knows the literal, or lexical, meaning of an expression as part of his semantic competence ipso facto knows its metaphorical meaning, since the latter is nothing but a proper part of the former that results from feature- cancellation. The virtue of this strategy was its straight- forward explication of how the metaphorical “depends” on the literal in terms of contain- ment. But this strength was also its defect. The strategy is plausible when the metaphor- ical interpretation results from dropping clear size and age variables that belong to the literal, lexical entry of a word, like those\n266 JOSEF STERN in the entry for “baby” in the metaphor “The old man is a baby.” But in order to capture the full variegated range of properties that many words can express metaphorically, this approach must broaden the (literal) lexical entries for words to include almost every property “commonly known” about its refer- ents. This descriptive desideratum conﬂicts, however, with the idea of lexical features as those known to a speaker in virtue of her semantic competence. Even if we grant that common knowledge is part of the “dictio- nary meaning” of a word – including false but stereotypical features (such as Searle’s, 1993, example of the stereotypical features of “gorilla”) – many metaphors express prop- erties noticed on and restricted to their occa- sion of utterance rather than antecedently accepted associations. The only way to cap- ture all such properties in a literal, lexical entry of an expression would be to make every property of an individual, including the merely presupposed or newly noticed in context, a lexical feature. The theory that results is hardly semantic.3 Again, the moral of this story is that we must take seriously context and, speciﬁcally, the contribution of extra-linguistic presup- positions and beliefs, in metaphorical inter- pretation. But it is as important, when we build context into semantics, that we must respect the distinction between the linguis- tic and extra-linguistic. How, then should we proceed? Most contemporary theorists conclude from its context-dependence that metaphor should be treated in pragmatics as a matter of use rather than in semantics as a kind of meaning. But there are two compet- ing understandings of the use-meaning dis- tinction in this connection. Some take what a speaker can use the word to mean to be a pragmatic notion of speaker’s meaning in addition to semantic sentence meaning. Such a notion of meaning is rule-governed but the proposed principles or rules are prag- matic, for example, conversational maxims that generate implicatures (Grice, 1975), the mutual recognition of intentions (Fogelin, 1988), speech act illocutions or perlocutions (Cohen, 1975), principles of relevance that underlie “loose” use of language (Sperber & Wilson, 1986), or principles of recall or association (“being called to mind”; Searle, 1993). So, for all these authors, the claim that metaphor falls in pragmatics is the claim that the kind of rules and conditions that make up the theory are use-based. For a second group, to call metaphor a matter of pragmatics or use is to oppose it to linguistic phenomena that can be explained in terms of meaning; to say that metaphor is a matter of use means that it deﬁes theoretical, law-like explanation. The most radical exponent of this line is Richard Rorty (1987) according to whom “metaphor belongs exclusively to the domain of use,” a “jungle” of irregular and unpredictable noises, in sharp contrast to the regular “lit- eral use of language” for which “seman- tical notions like ‘meaning’ have a role” (p. 285). A more moderate but more inﬂu- ential proponent of more or less the same stance is Donald Davidson (1984, 1986) who makes a quartet of provocative claims: (i) that there is no metaphorical meaning in addition to or in place of the literal meaning of expressions used metaphorically; (ii) that all a metaphor is is an imaginative use of a sentence exclusively with its literal meaning, whose (non-rule-governed) effect is to make us notice a likeness; (iii) that what the metaphor conveys is nonproposi- tional, not a “deﬁnite cognitive content”; and (iv) that there can be no compositional semantic theory of metaphor that shows how the metaphorical meaning of every expressible metaphor is a function of a ﬁnite number of simple meanings and a ﬁnite number of rules of composition. Moreover, Davidson argues that those who think of the feature R expressed by a metaphorical utter- ance “S is P” as a metaphorical meaning of P in its context are just playing fast and loose with the notion of meaning. For the whole point of meaning (i.e., literal meaning) is to serve as a feature of an expression (type) that it “has prior to and indepen- dent of the context of use” (1984, 247) and hence can explain why all its tokens make the same truth-conditional contribu- tion to the utterances in which they occur. There are no analogous cross-contextual\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 267 regularities to explain for metaphor since each metaphorical utterance of P in its con- text appears to express a different truth- conditional feature R in that context. Hence, there is no reason to posit metaphorical meaning. I shall not systematically evaluate these theories here (see, however, Stern, 2000), but their twofold challenge to us is clear: If we are to develop a semantic theory of metaphor, we must, ﬁrst, demonstrate how we can capture its context-dependence without totally obscuring the boundary between the linguistic and extra-linguistic and, second, we must show why, given the substantial contextual input to our under- standing of metaphor, a level of semantic knowledge is explanatory. This brings me to our conception of semantics and its relation to context. 3. Semantics versus Pragmatics of Metaphor The ﬁrst semantic theories of metaphor defended its cognitive meaningfulness in an environment that took it instead to be rhetorical, emotive, or merely stylis- tic. The second generation took metaphor to be semantic insofar as it could be explained in terms of violations of seman- tic rules for literal language. Contemporary views characterize metaphor as a seman- tic phenomenon in order to deny that it is a (entirely) pragmatic affair. However, this dispute over metaphor takes place against a rich background of controversy among philosophers, linguists, and cogni- tive scientists over the general character of the semantics–pragmatics distinction in the study of language. Before turning to metaphor, let me therefore say how I draw this distinction. It will be helpful to dis- tinguish two different issues surrounding the distinction and its relation to context- dependence. The ﬁrst concerns what aspects of interpretation, or what we intuitively understand by our utterances, to include in semantics and what in pragmatics. Some (Montague, 1974) take semantics to be exclusively concerned with eternal or context-independent language, pragmatics with the context-dependent, indexicals, and demonstratives as well as conversational implicatures and indirect speech acts. Oth- ers (Stalnaker, 1972) take semantics to be a theory of propositions or truth-conditions regardless of the sentences that express them. Thus, semantics will include propo- sitions expressed by sentences containing demonstratives and indexicals, but also ones that are shaped by speakers’ intentions. Prag- matics then deals with all additional impli- cations conveyed by speech acts that bear on their appropriate use in context. Yet a third group (Stanley, 2000; Stanley & King, 2005; Stanley & Szabo, 2000) takes seman- tics to be a theory of the meanings, or semantic values, of simple expressions in the language and of the rules for combining them into the complex meanings, or seman- tic values, of more complex expressions (including sentences). Pragmatics in turn deals with all other intuitively understood or implicated propositions conveyed by the utterance. My view of this ﬁrst issue, like the third position, takes semantics to be concerned with the meanings of the parts of lan- guage and their combinatorics. But rather than being a theory of the semantic val- ues themselves and their rules of compo- sition, I take semantics to be a theory of the speaker’s knowledge of meaning that underlies his ability to produce and compre- hend utterances (Higginbotham, 1992). This knowledge of meaning does not itself neces- sarily yield understanding, or knowledge of truth-conditions, of any utterance; its point is rather to constrain which communica- tive intentions – intentions to express truth- valued claims – are expressible employing particular linguistic representations. It inter- faces both with the other sub-faculties of the speaker’s language faculty and with his extra-linguistic mental faculties, perceptual skills, and commonsense knowledge – which I count as the context of the interpreta- tion. (I return to the context below.) Only in conjunction with these other skills, atti- tudes, and competences, does the speaker’s\n268 JOSEF STERN semantic knowledge generate knowledge of actual truth-conditions and, hence, under- standing of utterances. Nonetheless, while it is not strictly speaking semantic, I also would not say that the speaker’s knowl- edge of propositions, or truth-conditions, is pragmatic. Let’s instead distinguish among: (i) semantic knowledge proper (of the meanings of simple expressions and the rules of compositionality), (ii) semantically constrained extra-linguistic knowledge (of truth-conditions or propositional content), and (iii) semantically unconstrained knowl- edge (of various kinds of context-dependent implicatures, affects, illocutions, causal effects, and other information inferred from the content of utterances). Furthermore, following Kaplan (1989), I distinguish the (propositional) content of a (sub-sentential) expression (in its con- text) from its character. Content is the fac- tor corresponding to the expression rele- vant to evaluating the truth of its utterance (as part of a sentence) at a circumstance, or what the expression contributes to the truth-conditions of its utterances. Charac- ter is a function from contexts to contents that, in each context, determines what its content would be. For example, the charac- ter of the indexical “I” is the rule that each of its tokens refers to its speaker in its con- text, where that individual (in the context, say, me when I am its utterer) is the referen- tial value or content relevant to the truth- condition of the utterances in which that token of “I” occurs.4 All expressions (types), it should be added, have characters. How- ever, the characters of eternal expressions are “constant,” that is, they determine the same referential value (content) in all contexts; only those of demonstratives and indexicals are nonconstant – yielding different referen- tial values (contents) in different contexts. Now, it is character, not content (or ref- erential value) in a context (knowledge of which depends, say, for “I” on extra-linguistic knowledge of who is speaking), which is what a speaker knows when he knows the (linguistic) meaning of an expression. Char- acter rather than content is, then, closest to our notion of (conventional) linguistic meaning, and knowledge of character con- stitutes the domain of semantic theory.5 The second issue is the question how extra-linguistic context determines or affects what is intuitively said by an utterance, its truth-conditions, or propositional content. At one extreme, what is said by some sen- tences (e.g., “I am happy”) is sensitive to con- text in ways that are explicitly constrained by the meanings of their constituent expres- sions, for example, the rule for the ﬁrst- person indexical “I” that each of its utter- ances (directly) refers to its speaker (who is therefore its propositional content). At a sec- ond extreme, there are utterances (e.g., “Can you shut the door?” uttered in a context in which there is a draft, meant as a request to close it, as opposed to a context in which the addressee is asked whether he is phys- ically capable of moving a two-ton door) whose intuitive content also depends on context but is constrained by no linguistic or semantic feature, only by the speaker’s extra- linguistic purposes or intentions in uttering it. With regard to these two classes of utter- ances, (almost) everyone agrees that what is said by utterances at the ﬁrst extreme falls in semantics and that what is communicated at the second extreme does not. However, between these two extremes there is a wide range of utterances, such as (5) It is raining (at a contextually salient location). (6) Every student (in the course) failed the exam. (7) I ate breakfast (this morning). whose intuitive truth-conditions (which includes the parenthetic content) are context-dependent but do not contain a concrete linguistic element in the sen- tence uttered that linguistically controls the contextual contribution. About these utterances, it is an open theoretical ques- tion whether there are linguistic constraints that govern their context-dependent con- tent. The contextualists argue that our intu- itive understanding of utterances, including even simple expressions and even simple sentences (like (5)–(7)) is so pervasively\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 269 context-sensitive that we must acknowledge truth-conditional factors contributed by and in context that are not semantically licensed or governed. All truth-conditions are at best pragmatically determined (Bach, 1994, 2002; Carston, 1988, 2002; R´ecanati, 2004; Sperber & Wilson, 1995; Travis, 2000).6 A second camp, the literalists, argue that the intuitive truth-conditions of utterances admittedly contain factors not articulated by overt, concrete constituents, but that does not show that those contextual con- tributions are not semantically constrained. On the contrary, when we examine sim- ple sentences embedded in more com- plex conﬁgurations (e.g., quantiﬁed condi- tionals or anaphoric constructions), various constraints on their contextual dependence become evident. This data shows that at a more abstract level of semantic representa- tion of the utterance, at the level of its logical form, there do exist underlying abstract lin- guistic elements whose meaning constrains these additional contextual contributions to the truth-conditions (Stanley, 2000). My own view on this second issue is aligned with the literalists. Not only are there context-dependent expressions; some eternal expressions admit context- dependent interpretations or uses, and these context-dependent interpretations or uses are semantically constrained no different from the context-dependent expressions themselves (Kaplan, 1989). For example, deﬁnite descriptions composed of eternal expressions can be used demonstratively to refer (at all, including counterfactual, cir- cumstances) to the individual (uniquely) designated by them in their context of utter- ance. Thus, the content of these uses or interpretations is context-dependent, even though they contain no concrete demon- stratives. Moreover, they are governed by the same semantic constraints that apply to explicit demonstratives. In their case, as the literalist claims, their semantic constraints are best represented by an abstract oper- ator at the level of logical form. Indeed, David Kaplan has proposed such an operator “Dthat” for this very purpose: to take eter- nal (nonrigid) deﬁnite descriptions Ø and convert them into lexical representations Dthat[Ø] that represent the demonstrative (hence, rigid and context-dependent) inter- pretation of Ø. Now, this general dispute over the con- textual determination of truth-conditions, as in (5)–(7), has a variant for metaphor. There is in general no explicit verbal expres- sion (e.g., an operator like “metaphorically speaking”) that constrains the contextual contribution to metaphorical interpretation, that is, the truth-conditions or proposi- tion expressed by the utterance interpreted metaphorically in a context. The contextu- alists (Bezuidenhout, 2001; R´ecanati, 2004) therefore conclude that metaphor is a prod- uct of direct, that is, semantically uncon- strained, contextual enrichment. I argue, on the other hand, that the contextual con- tribution to the contents of metaphors is semantically constrained. And while the constraints are not realized in concrete ver- bal constituents of metaphorical utterances, they are borne by more abstract represen- tations (like Kaplan’s “Dthat”) that occur at an underlying level of logical form. Fur- thermore, the constraints on metaphorical interpretations have the same formal struc- ture as the constraints that govern the truth- conditional interpretation of demonstratives and indexicals, constraints carried by their nonconstant characters. So, if there is a semantic theory of metaphor, its domain will also be knowledge of metaphorical character, rather than of the contents, or truth-conditions, of metaphors in particular contexts. 4. The Context of a Metaphor With this general conception of seman- tics in hand, we now have the resources to sketch a semantic theory for metaphor, a theory of metaphorical meaning, that takes into account both its context- dependence and literal-dependence. Trans- lated into our semantic vocabulary, the different metaphorical interpretations that utterances of one expression (type) can express in different contexts and on different\n270 JOSEF STERN occasions are their (propositional) contents, the factors that bear on the truth-value of their utterances. Because the individual fea- tures (e.g., being greater than her peers for “is the sun” in (1)) expressed in these con- tents depend in part on the speaker’s extra- linguistic skills and presuppositions, the contents of these metaphorical interpreta- tions are not themselves known solely in virtue of semantic competence. But it does not follow that metaphor lies entirely out- side semantics. What the speaker does know in virtue of his semantic knowledge is the character of the metaphor, that is, a rule or directive to map a parameter of the con- text into the content of the metaphor in that context. Metaphorical character con- strains which contents can be metaphor- ically expressed by which expressions in which contexts. And insofar as the function of meaning is generally to constrain which intentions can be expressed by which lin- guistic items on which occasions, we can take its character to be the meaning of a metaphor. In order to work out these con- straints, let’s take a closer look at the context of a metaphor. Context plays three roles in communica- tive exchanges involving metaphor. First, as we noted earlier, context – the speaker’s intention, the topic of discourse, and other presuppositions – plays a crucial role in our identiﬁcation or recognition of an utterance as a metaphor. No syntactic or semantic condition (like grammatical or semantical deviance) signals that (8) Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – /I took the one less traveled by (Frost) is a metaphor, only the contextual partici- pants’ presuppositions and beliefs about the author/speaker’s intention. This role of con- text is no different for metaphor than for the literal. But because it is only after the assign- ment of a type to the sounds or words that it is possible to semantically interpret them, this role of the context is pre-semantic. A second role of the context in metaphor- ical communication is post-semantic. Utter- ances interpreted metaphorically, no differ- ent from those used literally, can be used for an indeﬁnite number of purposes or with var- ious extra-linguistic intentions: to question, demand, warn, ﬂatter, deceive, or threaten. If I ask my son (9) Did a typhoon hit your room? not only am I not asking him whether (lit- erally) a typhoon struck; I am also not ask- ing for a yes-or-no answer to the question (expressed metaphorically) whether his room is or is not a mess; I am gently directing him to clean it up – or else. (Compare the literal question in a similar context: “Why are all your clothes and books scattered on the ﬂoor?”) His knowledge of that intention will be a function of his (and my) beliefs about my general attitudes toward neatness, authority, and so on. Likewise, suppose one of Romeo’s peers believes that Juliet is the kind of woman who, like the sun, consumes those who get too close to or too intimate with her, who engage her directly in the eye. He might utter (1) to warn Romeo to cool it and keep his distance. Again, this role of context is no different for metaphor than with the literal. What is practically commu- nicated is an inference drawn in context from a prior proposition that constitutes the base understanding of the utterance. Hence, this role of the context for a metaphor, which assumes that it already has a content, or truth-conditions, or says something, is post- semantic. Do the pre-semantic and the post- semantic exhaust the roles of the context in communicative exchanges involving metaphor? In the literal use of certain linguistic expressions, there is also a third semantic role for the context. Take a sound sequence containing the sound “i.” In its pre-semantic role, context enables us to assign that sound to a given linguistic type (with its conventional meaning or character): either the afﬁrmative “aye” or the organ-term “eye” or the yelp “ai” or the ﬁrst-person indexical “I.” Suppose now that the token is assigned the ﬁrst-person pronoun “I” as its type. And suppose I (JS) am bickering with my buddy Sam over a bill, and I tell him emphatically (with stress on “I”)\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 271 (10) I am not paying in order to bring him to understand the proposition expressed in that context by (11) You are paying. or perhaps: (12) If anyone pays, it won’t be me. Here context functions in its post-semantic role, determining an implicature, the prag- matic meaning of (10). But for the ﬁrst- person indexical “I,” there is yet a third, semantic role for context. Given the meaning-rule or character of “I,” the context and, in particular, its speaker parameter ﬁxes the truth-conditional factor or propositional constituent for my (JS’s) utterance of “I” in (10); (10*) <Not<JS, Pays>> This role of the context – articulated by the linguistic meaning, or character, of the indexical and by which the contribution of the context is constrained to the actual speaker – is semantic. Is there an analogous semantic role for the context in metaphorical interpretation? We noted at the beginning of the paper that metaphorical interpretations of one expres- sion (type) vary from occasion to occa- sion and from context to context. Now, in fact there are a variety of different contex- tual factors that feed into this variability. For example, contrast the interpretation of (1) in the context depicted in Shakespeare’s play (1*) (1*) But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the sun. Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she . . . Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes. To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright, That birds would sing, and think it were not night . . . (Romeo and Juliet II, ii, 2–23; my emphasis) with the interpretation of the “sun” metaphor in Salisbury’s description of the end of Richard II’s reign (13) Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the ﬁrmament. Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, Witness storms to come, woe and unrest; Thy friends are ﬂed to wait upon thy foes, And crossly to thy good all fortune goes. (Richard II, II, iv; my emphasis) Here the (setting) sun exempliﬁes and thereby expresses (declining) glory, (lost) authority, and insecurity. And contrast also these two Shakespearean “sun” metaphors with the Spanish Hebrew poet Judah Halevi’s use of “the sun” in his love poem: (14) The night the girl gazelle displayed to me Her cheek – the sun – beneath its veil of hair, Red as a ruby, and beneath, a brow Of moistened marble (color won- drous fair!)\n272 JOSEF STERN I fancied her the sun, which rising reddens Clouds of morning with its crimson ﬂare. (Scheindlin, 1986, 119) where it expresses the beloved’s radiance but (together with the “marble” metaphor) abso- lute coldness and unapproachability. In each of these contexts, the utterance of “(is) the sun” expresses a different metaphor- ical interpretation. In Stern (2000), I called these “exemplication metaphors” because their content consists of a set of features its literal referent exempliﬁes or of which it is a sample in the context (Goodman, 1976). What distinguishes this class of metaphors is that the features exempliﬁed or sampled by the individual referred to by the literal vehicle of any single metaphorical expres- sion in turn depend on the schema or sam- ple set to which that literal referent belongs and on the range of features sampled by the schema as a whole. In each of these passages, or literary contexts, the author spells out in detail the appropriate schema, network, or family of expressions (marked by ital- ics) relative to which the single metaphor- ical expression is interpreted. This systemic dimension of metaphorical interpretation was ﬁrst pointed out by Nelson Goodman but in recent years it has become a leitmo- tif in the literature, due in large measure to the research on “conventional metaphors” of the linguist George Lakoff and his school (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff, 1993; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Lakoff & Turner, 1989; for alternative accounts, see Glucksberg, 2001; Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990, 1993; Kittay, 1987; Thompson & Thompson, 1987; Tirrell, 1989; White, 1996). But the impor- tant point is that in these complex metaphors (1*), (13), and (14), the interpre- tations of “the sun” vary according to the schema of objects with which the (literal) referent or extension of the literal vehicle is classiﬁed in the context. Thus, the underly- ing unit for the interpretation of an individ- ual metaphor is its whole schema, network, or family, whether or not the latter is made explicit in the context or is simply common knowledge. Not all metaphors are exempliﬁcational in this way. A speaker may utter (1) in a context in which he makes clear that he is drawing on stereotypical beliefs about the eternal, predictable circular motion of the sun to express the content that Juliet is utterly (and boringly) reliable, predictable, and regular in her movements, someone you can always count on to rise and set, who never surprises or inspires. With yet another class of complex metaphors, the speaker/author may build up its interpre- tation by drawing out the various, more or less strong inductive consequences of a root metaphor. For example, in T. S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” the yellow fog is a cat that rubs its back on the win- dow, licks its tongue, makes sudden leaps, curls about the house, and sleeps. Closer attention to these (different kinds of) sys- tematic networks in metaphorical interpre- tation, and their interaction, will enable us to understand better how complex metaphors in poetry function. (On the analysis of com- plex metaphors, see now White, 1996.) Now, if we take each of these different interpretations – each of the individual features expressed in the content – one by one, they look idiosyncratic and unre- lated, as the use-theorists of metaphor contend. But if we look at the triples of interpretations (propositional contents), expression types (with their literal mean- ing), and the respective contexts, each of the different interpretations corresponds to a difference in context, either a verbally articulated (literary) context or one con- stituted by unarticulated beliefs or presup- positions The moral is that there may be little that is regular so long as we look only at particular metaphorical interpretations in each context in isolation. However, at one interpretative “level” more abstract – a level that relates each metaphorical interpretation of the same expression (type), with its con- stant literal meaning, to a relevant feature of its respective context of use, namely, shared presuppositions – metaphorical interpreta- tion does follow regularities and supports\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 273 predictions. Same expression (with the same literal meaning), in the same context – that is, with the same presuppositions – the result is the same interpretation. Same expres- sion, different contexts – that is, different presuppositions – different interpretations. The structure of these variations – which may be the “transfer” of which Aristotle spoke in the Rhetoric – is essential to under- stand both the productivity and mechanism of metaphorical interpretation. And it is at this level that relates interpretation to con- text that we should look for the semantic constraints to be captured in a notion of metaphorical meaning. In sum, to answer our earlier question, Is there a semantic role for the context in metaphorical interpretation? I am suggesting that the semantic context for the interpreta- tion of a metaphor consists in a set of contex- tual presuppositions associated with its lit- eral vehicle, a contextual parameter like the familiar and relatively well-deﬁned parame- ters for singular demonstratives and indexi- cals – the speaker for “I,” the time of utter- ance for “now,” the demonstratum for “that,” and so on. There remain signiﬁcant differ- ences between the context-dependence of metaphors and demonstratives and indexi- cals, but they are of degree rather than kind. For predicate demonstratives, such as “thus” or “is that way,” the parameter is already less clear: an ostended property or manner. For metaphors, whose basic syntactic unit is the predicate, the contextual parameter is even less deﬁned. By “presupposition” here I mean the prag- matic notion, a species of propositional atti- tude (Stalnaker, 1972, 1973), a set of propo- sitions to which a speaker, in making an utterance, commits himself in that, in their absence, his utterance would be inappropri- ate or (as with metaphor) uninterpretable as it is. These presuppositions constitute the context of a metaphor insofar as they deﬁne its range of possible interpretations on the occasion. As we have seen in our exam- ples, the contents of the presuppositions can differ signiﬁcantly depending on the “kind” of metaphor. For some, the presuppositions can be characterized as “common knowl- edge” about features or properties associated with the metaphorical expression – bear- ing in mind that “knowledge” here does not carry the implication that the presupposi- tions must be true or even believed to be true. As Black (1962) ﬁrst observed, what is relevant to the metaphorical interpreta- tion of an expression Ø is its “system of associated commonplaces,” rather than its deﬁnition or the features actually true of Ø’s. In other cases, the presuppositions are local to the actual context of utterance, for example, those that are taken to be exem- pliﬁed, or sampled, by the referent of the literal vehicle relative to a sample schema which, in turn, depends on salience in con- text (see Stern, 2000). In yet other cases, the relevant presuppositions are made in accordance with a principle of accommoda- tion (Lewis, 1979) simply in order to enable the interpretation of the metaphor. Finally, the full set of relevant presuppositions for a metaphorical interpretation includes not only those associated with the literal vehicle (e.g., “is the sun” in (1)) but also those associ- ated with other elements in its linguistic and extra-linguistic environment (e.g., “Juliet”). However, while those associated with the metaphorical expression serve to generate potential features of content, those associ- ated with the environment ﬁlter out the fea- tures that cannot be appropriately taken to be the content of the metaphor in the con- text (Reinhart, 1970; Stern, 2000).7 What makes something a metaphor according to this account is both narrower and wider than the received view. There is no one kind of associated property (e.g., a feature of resemblance) that serves as the ground for all metaphors; rather interpreta- tions draw on all sorts of properties. But what is essential is that the feature be presupposed to be “associated” with the literal vehicle of the metaphor in the context. What distin- guishes a metaphor is not the content of the feature that enters into its interpretation, but its context-sensitive meaning (character) that draws on the contextually presupposed feature. The semantics addresses this notion of metaphorical meaning, while the no less important (and often more interesting)\n274 JOSEF STERN characteristics of the presuppositions them- selves (like those adumbrated in the previous paragraph) belong to pragmatics, the appli- cation of the speaker’s semantic knowledge in and to a context to yield actual proposi- tions and more. 5. Metaphorical Meaning The role of metaphorical meaning, analyzed as character, is to specify how the interpre- tation of a metaphor – its content, namely, the set of features that belong to its truth- conditions – depends on and varies with a speciﬁc parameter of its context, namely, a particular set of presuppositions associated in the context with its literal vehicle. The speaker’s semantic competence in metaphor, like the semantic competence that under- lies her ability to use demonstratives, consists in knowledge of that meaning, or character, namely, a function from the metaphorically relevant associated proper- ties in the context set of presuppositions to the particular subset of properties that constitute the content of the metaphor in that context. Together with its contextual presuppositions, the character yields the content of the interpretation, but the mean- ing is not itself part of that content. (For other accounts of the context-dependence of metaphor, see Berg, 1988; Bergmann, 1982; Bezuidenhout, 2001; Kittay, 1987; Leezen- berg, 2001; Nogales, 1999; Schefﬂer, 1979.) Thus far, I have emphasized parallels between demonstratives and metaphors. But there are also differences. Meanings (or characters) are meanings (or characters) of expressions; but metaphor is a kind of use or interpretation of arbitrary expressions, and uses (interpretations) don’t have mean- ings. Furthermore, unlike semantic compe- tence in demonstratives and indexicals that involves knowledge of the meanings of indi- vidual linguistic items, metaphorical com- petence involves mastery of an interpre- tive skill or ability one can apply to arbi- trary expressions across the language. To address these two differences, I have there- fore coined an operator “Mthat,” modeled after David Kaplan’s “Dthat” (see section 3), that both lexically realizes metaphori- cal interpretation (and thereby provides a bearer for its meaning) and captures its skill- like character. “Dthat” takes the descrip- tion “the man in black” and produces the demonstrative-description “Dthat[‘the man in black’]” that directly (and rigidly) refers to the individual in the context who ﬁts the description. By analogy, “Mthat” takes a lit- eral expression like “is the sun” and produces the “metaphorical expression” “Mthat[‘is the sun’]” that expresses a particular subset of presupposed properties associated with the embedded literal vehicle in the con- text. “Mthat,” like “Dthat” is not an actual expression of English; it is an abstract lin- guistic element, syntactically represented at the level of logical form, intended to cap- ture the linguistic competence that under- lies our ability to use or interpret expressions metaphorically. Of course, there are still dif- ferences between metaphors (or metaphor- ical expressions) and demonstratives (and indexicals) or Dthat-descriptions. The con- tent of “Dthat[Ø]” in a context is an individual; the content of “Mthat[Ø]” is a set of properties. The former is the indi- vidual that ﬁts or satisﬁes the description Ø; the latter is a subset of the properties that are parametrically related to Ø (like the relation of the speaker to “I”). Finally, both the characters and contents of Dthat- descriptions are arguably compositionally determined by the characters and contents, respectively, of their component descrip- tions. On the other hand, neither the charac- ter nor the content of a metaphorical expres- sion Mthat[Ø] is a compositional function of the character or content, respectively, of its constituents. However, the metaphorical expression “Mthat[Ø]” is individuated by the linguistic type of its literal vehicle: If Ø and \u0002 are of different types, then Mthat[Ø] and Mthat[\u0002] are of different types. The rea- son for this is that the context set of pre- supposed metaphorically associated proper- ties is not associated with either the exten- sion or intension of the literal vehicle. If it were, we ought to be able to substitute a co-extensive or co-intensional expression\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 275 for Ø without affecting the metaphorical interpretation; but it is easy to see that that is not the case if you try to interchange either the co-extensional “the largest gaseous blob in the solar system” and “the sun” or the co-intensional “Tully” and “Cicero” (Stern, 2000) or “cur” and “mongrel” (Hills, 2002). Rather the contextual parameter for metaphor is a context set of metaphorically relevant presuppositions associated with the literal word Ø (in a sentence in a context) or (possibly) with its (literal) character (in S in c).8 This, I want to propose, is the sense in which the metaphorical–the character of the metaphor – depends on the literal – on the literal vehicle itself, the word or its meaning (character). Its literal-dependence is not his- torical or genetic, nor does it require that the speaker understand what the utterance liter- ally says. But the literal vehicle is active in the metaphorical interpretation because the relevant contextual parameter is triggered by, and individuated in accordance with, its meaning. The function of linguistic meaning in general is to capture linguistic constraints that determine which of a speaker’s inten- tions can be (literally) communicated by which expressions. Similarly, metaphorical meaning constrains the content a speaker can use an expression to express metaphor- ically. Let me give one example, begin- ning with a similar constraint that governs the interpretation of indexicals. Suppose I utter (15) I live in Jerusalem. If Susan reports what I said, she must say (16) Stern says that he lives in Jerusalem, not (17) Stern says that I live in Jerusalem because the content of the indexical “I” is always ﬁxed by its actual context, the con- text of its speaker, not by that of the belief- worlds of the subject of (17), “Stern.” There- fore, Susan must shift from “I” to “he” (or to another word that expresses the content of “I” in (15)). I call this condition according to which the interpretation of an indexical always cleaves to its actual context of utter- ance The Actual Context Constraint (ACC). Similarly, suppose I say: (18) He [points at a person who in c is Al] might have been president. Because (18) contains a modal, uttered in the context c (which includes the world w(c), the world of the context c), it is true at w(c) just in case (19) There is some world w* (accessible to w(c)) in which Al is president. It is not enough for (18) to be true at w(c) for there to be someone in w*, say, George, who is pointed at in w* and who is presi- dent in w*. Although the truth-value of (18) is determined by the facts at w*, its interpre- tation or content is ﬁxed by its actual context c, as the ACC predicts. A similar story holds for metaphor. Sup- pose Count Paris in Shakespeare’s play denies (1) but concedes: (20) Well, Juliet might have been the sun (uttered in c which includes w(c)) where “is the sun” is again interpreted metaphorically to express the proposition that Juliet is peerless. Since (20) is also a modal sentence, it is true in w(c), the world of its context of utterance, just in case (21) There is some world w*(accessible to w(c)) in which Juliet is peerless. that is, where she has the property metaphorically expressed by “is the sun” back in c. Here, again, the relevant inter- pretation is not the interpretation “is the sun” would be given in w* had it been uttered there. Suppose, for example, that in w* “the sun” is the paradigm example of bor- ing regularity; it is not sufﬁcient for (or rel- evant to) the truth of Paris’s utterance of (20) in c, interpreted metaphorically, that Juliet in w* be tediously predictable in her actions. She must possess in w* the prop- erty expressed by the metaphor in c. Like demonstratives, metaphorical interpretation obeys the ACC. As with “I,” its meaning does not determine what the metaphor must say, or under what conditions it is true; it only\n276 JOSEF STERN speciﬁes what the interpretation cannot be. This common constraint calls for a common kind of meaning, the nonconstant character common to indexicals and metaphors.9 6. The Cognitive Signiﬁcance of Metaphors As we saw in section 2, from their begin- ning semantic theories of metaphor have been concerned with questions of cognitive signiﬁcance. It was assumed either that the metaphorical mode of expression is merely stylistic, rhetorical, or decorative, carrying no additional cognitive value beyond what could be expressed literally, or that the cognitive signiﬁcance of a metaphor is sui generis, completely unlike the information conveyed by literal language. And to decide among these alternatives, philosophers often appealed to tests of literal paraphrasabil- ity (Black, 1962; Cavell, 1967). However, these tests were severely hampered by inher- ently unclear criteria for success (Bergmann, 1982; Davidson, 1984; Levinson, 2001; Stern, 2000). In recent years, philosophers have turned the inquiry in new, more promising directions. Some have examined the cogni- tive functioning of metaphors in scientiﬁc theories, religious language, and art and ethi- cal criticism (Alston, 1964; Boyd, 1993; Den- ham, 1998). Others have explored ways in which a metaphor can make us see some- thing as something else that cannot be cap- tured by a simple belief attitude (Black, 1993; Davidson, 1986; Davies, 1982; Moran, 1989). Yet others have looked at the role of metaphors in creating a sense of intimacy or community and their relation to jokes and riddles, an approach that promises to illu- minate other cognitive aspects of metaphor such as their sense of surprise (Cohen, 1978; Stern, 2000). I shall conclude this chapter with one example of how a metaphorical mode of expression can bear a kind of informa- tion apart from its truth-conditional con- tent that carries explanatory power in belief-ascriptions. Marie, a young woman in her teens, suffered from the eating disor- der of anorexia nervosa. In treatment, she explained to her therapist that her mother had forbade her to continue seeing her boyfriend. Angrily, she reported, she had said to herself: (22) I won’t swallow that [referring to her mother’s interdiction]. Let’s assume that in the context in which she uttered (22) Marie’s use of the word “swal- low” was metaphorical (Merleau-Ponty, cited in Danto, 1978). Let’s also suppose that what Marie said by (22) interpreted metaphorically, is expressed by (23) Marie won’t obey her mother’s inter- diction. Does (23) adequately express everything said by Marie’s utterance of (22)? Yes and No. Yes, insofar as (22) is true, spoken by Marie referring to her mother’s interdic- tion, just in case Marie does not obey her mother’s interdiction, that is, (23). No, inso- far as her utterance of (22) is meant to con- tribute to an explanation of her anorexic behavior, albeit as an irrational way of resist- ing her mother’s command. For in order to explain why Marie stopped eating in terms of a belief we would ascribe to her on the evidence of her utterance of (22), we must somehow include as part of the representa- tion of her belief the fact that what she said, namely, that she would not obey her mother, was expressed metaphorically using the verb “swallow.” Only under that metaphorical mode of expression of what she said – only if we include how she metaphorically believed, or expressed, what she believed – can we see any connection, conscious or unconscious, between her belief and her subsequent anorexic behavior. To be sure, Marie’s behavior and the connection she made are not rational, and no explanation should make it so. But only by acknowl- edging the cognitive and explanatory signif- icance of the metaphorical meaning with which she expressed her belief can we explain her behavior at all. The metaphorical mode in which Marie expressed her belief is essential, not to determine whether what she said is true or false, but for our\nMETAPHOR, SEMANTICS, AND CONTEXT 277 folk-psychological purposes of explaining her behavior.10 But this additional informa- tion seems to be individuated by the char- acter of the metaphorical expression under- lying (22). By investigating these structures, semantic theories of metaphor can help us better understand its cognitive signiﬁcance above and beyond its propositional content in context. Notes 1 A red herring is a fallacy of irrelevance, so- called because of the reputed practice of escaped convicts who used pickled herrings to throw bloodhounds off the scent. It is not dif- ﬁcult to imagine a current speaker who knows that a red herring is an irrelevant argument even if she does not know that a herring is a ﬁsh or (much less plausibly) that “red” is the name of a color. 2 The literal vehicle for a metaphor is the expression, for example, “is the sun” in (1) as it would be interpreted or (semantically) meant literally. 3 Similar objections apply to Kittay’s (1987) “perspectival theory,” which elaborates Black’s interaction theory using semantic ﬁeld theory; see Stern (2000). 4 Here I assume that indexicals (and demon- stratives) are directly referential terms; the content of an utterance of “I” is the very indi- vidual who is speaking, not (even) a (rigid) conceptual representation of the individual. 5 Where the simple expression is eternal, or not-context-sensitive, the character/meaning is equivalent to the content, or referent or semantic value assigned to it; that is, two expressions will have the same charac- ter/meaning iff they have the same content iff they have the same referent. Therefore, as Kaplan (1989) notes, this semantics is not adequate to capture differences of meaning (if there are any) among co-referential proper names. 6 Among these authors, some take this to mean that a principled, explanatory pragmatic the- ory of truth-conditions is possible, others that sensitivity to use excludes the possibility of a theory or general explanations. 7 Here the one question whether a given fea- ture is appropriate content should be distin- guished from a second question whether the content, once ﬁxed, is an appropriate thing to assert or utter in the context. 8 I emphasize that the presuppositions are associated with the literal word and only “possibly” with its character because, where we are dealing with eternal words (like the examples of co-intensional expressions cited in the text), any two co-intensional expressions will have the same character as well. This points to a general inadequacy in Kaplan’s semantics to deal with context- independent expressions, an inadequacy that carries over to our application of the seman- tics to metaphor. For further discussion, see Stern (2000), Hills (2002), and Stern (2006). 9 Similarly, to report someone’s metaphor, either the reporter can try to express only the content of the original utterance without replicating its metaphorical character or, if he wishes to preserve the metaphorical mode of expression, he must also recover the pre- suppositions of the original context in order to preserve the content. For discussion, see Stern (2000) and, for criticism, Bezuiden- hout (2001), Camp (2005), and Stern (2006). 10 See Stern (2000) which compares “essential metaphors” of this kind to John Perry’s (1979) “essential indexicals”; in both cases, it is the character of the respective expression that carries the additional information relevant to the explanation.

They can there- fore trigger new insights into underlying patterns, and it will be shown in this chapter that together these are leading to developments in our understanding of metaphor. Findings from corpus linguistic research indicate that linguistic metaphor is determined by context as well as the speaker’s or writer’s intended meaning. That is, metaphor is a textual and social phe- nomenon as well as a cognitive one. A fur- ther contribution is to metaphor theory. Pat- terns of linguistic metaphor suggest that the conceptual systems that underlie them inter- act dynamically. Corpus research generally proceeds from the accumulation of detailed observations about language in use to the- oretical questions, and this chapter begins with an example of one such observation. In work in the cognitive school, it has been proposed that temperature is a com- mon metaphor for feeling and that anger is often talked about as the pressure of ﬂuid in a heated container (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff, 1987). Research has tended to focus on how individuals experience anger. For instance, Lakoff’s (1987) work describes the processes in an individual which lead to him or her becoming angry, linked to his or her physiological reactions. Gibbs (1994) reports research exploring people’s reactions to sen- tences such as He almost exploded with anger and She blew her stack when she heard about her husband’s affair (1994: 18–19), each of which describe one individual’s behavior in terms of heat and pressure. However, cor- pus and text linguistic research into heat metaphors of anger suggest that this is not in fact the most frequent use. Heat metaphors are more often found in talk about the col- lective anger of a group of people and its impact, than in talk about the feelings of individuals. Van Teeffelen’s (1994) text analysis of metaphors in popular literature around the Palestinian–Israeli conﬂict starts with a detailed examination of the texts them- selves and the identiﬁcation of linguis- tic metaphors. He ﬁnds a number of lin- guistic metaphors that seem to realize a 280\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 281 mapping of anger onto heat, including inﬂamed, igniting, and wildﬁre. In his data, these characterize not the sensations of an individual but the behavior of a large group of people. Further, and importantly for his argument that the discourse is racist, the metaphors are used only to talk about Pales- tinians, not about Israelis. Palestinians tend to be characterized metaphorically as a mass, “governed by the laws of nature” (p. 393), in contrast to the “rational” Israeli protagonists. Corpus analysis of metaphors of ﬁre and heat also suggests that they predominantly describe the behavior of people as a group rather than as individuals. For instance, the expression fan the ﬂames is frequently used metaphorically, sometimes to talk about desire but more frequently to talk about anger. With this meaning, it invariably refers to the behavior of a group, in citations such as (1) Newly empowered extremist groups in nearly every state are fanning the ﬂames of intolerance and bigotry. Other lexis that frequently realize the mapping include ignite, spark, ﬁres, and heated (idioms like blow your top/stack are much rarer in the corpus). Entities that are ignited or sparked (off ) can include an indi- vidual’s actions but in the texts analyzed were more likely to be wars and other mass events. Fires are also more likely to refer to the behavior of a group of people than to an individual, and entities that are metaphori- cally heated are almost always speech events such as debates, discussions, and arguments rather then people or their feelings. Some of this bias toward collective experience could perhaps be accounted for by the nature of the texts studied, which include a number of newspapers and therefore reporting of col- lective events. However, it would not be true to say that there are few accounts of individ- uals’ feelings in the texts. There are a num- ber, but they do not tend to show as much use of heat and ﬁre metaphors as do descrip- tions of conﬂict. There are some exceptions, such as the following citation from popular literature, in which heat is used to describe an individual’s feelings: (2) She could feel the anger churning, grow- ing, bubbling up inside her. Autumn didn’t feel trapped any more, but burn- ing with rage. All the hate she felt for his father she turned and directed at him. But these are rare. Writers in the cognitive tradition argue that the grounds for the conceptual mapping ANGER IS FIRE, or more speciﬁcally, PRES- SURE OF HEATED FLUID IN A CONTAINER, lie in the bodily sensation of warmth that we experience when angry (for example, Lakoff, 1987). The evidence from text and corpus analysis points to another possible motivation. Fire has the potential to become uncontrollable and very destructive, and it can be started – ignited – with a small and apparently innocuous spark. The behavior of large groups of people can be mapped onto this behavior of ﬁre, resulting in the conceptual metaphor AN ANGRY GROUP OF PEOPLE IS A WILDFIRE. The linguistic evi- dence suggests that both mappings exist, each contributing to a different set of lin- guistic expressions, and sometimes interact- ing with and reinforcing each other. The cor- pus analysis described here suggests that the second mapping has had a stronger inﬂu- ence on current language use, though that is not direct evidence of its conceptual sig- niﬁcance. Van Teeffelen’s work also suggests an important ideological aspect to this map- ping. This corpus analysis has shown an aspect of metaphorical use that had not been picked up in discussions of heat metaphors, but that, like many corpus observations, seems self-evident once made. Observations like this could be dismissed as details, having little importance for theory. Corpus linguists would not accept this, as I explain in the next section, where I outline some basic principles of corpus linguistics. In later sections, I show how corpus data can chal- lenge intuitively derived linguistic data of the kind used in some experimental work on\n282 ALICE DEIGNAN metaphor. I then return to the contributions of corpus work to metaphor theory. Corpora in Research Corpora A “corpus” can be any collection of spoken or written texts. These could consist of the work of a single author, a number of issues of one or more newspapers, collections of tran- scribed spoken data, or more broadly based collections of a range of text types. The lin- guistic topics that can be investigated using a corpus are wide ranging. In terms of size and construction, cor- pora can be divided into two main types: “ready-made” corpora and corpora com- piled by the researcher. “Ready-made” cor- pora have been compiled by groups of aca- demic or commercial researchers. They are often available to individual researchers, and include the Bank of English (http://www. collins.co.uk) and the British National Cor- pus (http://info.ox.ac.uk/bnc). Corpora of this kind are large, and in an attempt to enable judgments about the language as a whole, they usually include a wide range of text types, although it would obviously be unsafe to claim that any corpus can ever be truly representative of the language experi- ence of all speakers. Unless otherwise indi- cated, the corpus referred to throughout this chapter is a 56-million-word sample of the Bank of English, and all citations are taken from it. The second type of corpus is one which the researcher has designed him or herself, usually because they wish to study language in a speciﬁc context. Corpora of this kind that have been used for metaphor research include Cameron’s corpus of educational discourse (2003), Koller’s corpus of news- paper reports and journal articles on the topic of mergers and acquisitions (2003), and Santa Ana’s corpus of issues of the Los Angeles Times (1999). These corpora tend to be much smaller than ready-made corpora and have usually been designed with the aim of representing one text-type or genre rather than the language as a whole. The researcher often has a specialized knowledge of the text type and discourse context, and an interest in associated social factors, so small corpora can allow for an in-depth analysis of metaphor in its discoursal and social contexts. This is in contrast to, and sometimes comple- menting, the overview of linguistic patterns of metaphor afforded by large ready-made corpora. Corpus Linguistics “Corpus linguistics” is usually taken to refer to analysis that is conducted with the aid of specialized corpus software, but perhaps more important than the tools of the dis- cipline is the theoretical approach which has emerged. This is manifested in two central and related characteristics. Firstly, a corpus-linguistic analysis should be corpus- driven as opposed to corpus-based, and sec- ondly, it should take account of all the data. Tognini-Bonelli (2001) discusses the nature of corpus-driven research, writing that it does not start with preexisting the- ories, which are simply conﬁrmed or illus- trated with the support of corpus data, but starts with the corpus. Moon’s (1998) work on ﬁxed expressions and idioms (FEIs) is an example of corpus-driven work. Her studies begin with an examination of every FEI in her corpus, using a tight deﬁni- tion of FEI, and automatic identiﬁcation procedures. In contrast, corpus-based work would examine preselected idioms and use the corpus to illustrate existing hypothe- ses. Moon’s corpus-driven approach results in new insights into the role of FEIs in the organization of discourse, and into the importance of their evaluative orientation. In reality, corpus-driven research in its purest form tends to be an ideal, and many corpus studies, including most metaphor studies, of necessity start with some sort of working hypothesis, but this is explored and tested through the data rather than being preim- posed on them. The second feature of corpus linguistic research is described by Sinclair as follows: It is a central part of the methodology . . . that every instance has the same weight as any other, and that selection is on the\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 283 basis of the number of instances of a certain kind. No instance is ignored or overlooked. (2004: 40) This is seen in Deignan’s analyses of metaphorically used words, which typically work with either every citation of a word or a large random sample and attempt to produce a classiﬁcation that covers every citation examined. For example, Deignan (1999c) analyzed 1,000 randomly selected citations of key words from the source domain of temperature and classiﬁed the metaphorical uses by meaning. This led her to argue that the semantic relations between the metaphorical uses are not as clearly structured as is sometimes claimed. For instance, metaphorical hot is occasionally used antonymously to metaphorical cold, but in many cases, there is only a slim seman- tic relationship between the metaphorical uses. Searching Corpora Ready-made corpora are usually far too big to read from end to end and are searched using various computer programs. Special- ized corpora can be searched using cor- pus software but are sometimes searched by hand. Assuming that the researcher uses corpus software, as is usually the case, the ﬁrst information that is often accessed is frequency: which word forms are the most frequent in the corpus. As the next step, the best-known way of studying individual words in a corpus is through the use of a program which searches for citations of par- ticular word forms, and generally organizes them so that the search word (or node) is in the middle of the computer screen, in the form of a concordance. The following is an extract of the concordance of drove. 1. called in a white Vauxhall, and drove away soon afterwards. 2. home as fast as possible. He seldom drove fast, and all the way home he 3. he considered the Jewish conspiracy drove him to repudiate the Jewish 4. These two today were crazy.

He took his key and drove to the backside of the old 11. country to Michigan, rented a car, drove up to a rusting Volkswagen van 12. dizziness and so on which probably drove you to get the drugs in the Printed extracts such as this can misrepre- sent the process of analyzing concordance data. For reasons of space, a sample of 12 citations is shown here, whereas the corpus contains 2,161 citations of drove, and 16,348 citations of all the inﬂections of drive, noun and verb. In a typical analysis, these would be processed automatically for information about collocates, that is, the words that co- occur with the node more frequently than a chance distribution of words would pre- dict (in the case of drove, collocates include car, lorry, and fast). A sample much larger than the above would then be examined in more detail, commonly 500 to 1,000 citations. A central difﬁculty for metaphor re- searchers is deciding on a starting point for research. Machine techniques favor a single word or ﬁxed multiword expression as the starting point of analysis, whereas metaphor researchers are often interested in patterns at a larger or deeper scale. Reading a corpus from beginning to end and identifying areas of interest is only a realistic possibility for small corpora. Cameron and Deignan (2003) used small and large corpora interactively, to exploit the advantages of each. Charteris- Black (2004) read a sample of each of his large corpora, and identiﬁed metaphors that he then searched for in the full corpora. Other possibilities include using thesauri to ensure that every term from a particular semantic ﬁeld is searched for, or beginning with linguistic metaphors listed in the con- ceptual metaphor literature and searching\n284 ALICE DEIGNAN for their collocates, techniques described by Deignan (1999a). Concordances and Intuition-Based Description From a computer’s point of view, a word form is simply a string of letters bounded by spaces, and in terms of the potential of mod- ern computers, counting the frequency of a word form in a bank of texts is not a difﬁcult task. Producing a concordance of the word form and calculating its most frequent col- locates involve several more tasks, but these are nonetheless relatively straightforward. However, these very simple computational tools have proven to be tremendously pow- erful in generating insights about language in use. All ﬂuent speakers of a language tend to use words in largely conventional patterns, and we therefore must have such patterns stored internally, but, for some reason, they are often not available to intuitive reﬂection (Sinclair, 1991, 2004). The use of automatic frequency counts and concordance programs brings patterns to the researcher’s attention, so that they can be studied with the aid of his/her linguistic knowledge. When we try to access our knowledge of word use without using con- cordance data, metaphorical uses may not occur to us, or we may think of ones which are memorable because they are innovative, and disregard conventional but vastly more frequent uses. The heat metaphors for anger discussed in the Introduction are one exam- ple. In the following concordance of drove, four citations appear to be metaphorical: 1. he considered the Jewish conspiracy drove him to repudiate the Jewish 2. These two today were crazy. They drove me mad.” United boss Steve 3. during the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon out 4. dizziness and so on which probably drove you to get the drugs in the While these metaphorical uses of drove seem obvious with hindsight, it is difﬁcult to be certain that they would have occurred to unaided intuition. In the following section, I give an example of a mismatch between the patterns found in the corpus and those found in intuitively derived linguistic data. Linguistic Data in Experimental Work Some metaphor researchers use experi- ments in which informants are asked to react to texts of different kinds, often con- sisting of literal and metaphorical phrasings of the same idea. The informants’ reaction times are measured and compared, and then discussed in the light of hypotheses about metaphor. The researchers generally invent the texts, which often contain examples of language that are rare or nonexistent in the corpus. For a corpus linguist, one problem arises when the texts used do not display natural patterns of collocation and meaning. Cur- rent research on collocation suggests that people may process text in longer units than the single word, often in units of three or more words (for example, Erman & War- ren, 2000; Wray, 2002). This phenomenon is sometimes known as “chunking”, and may explain how we are able to process text as rapidly as we do (Sinclair, 1991). In order to chunk text and thus read at a normal speed, we are reliant on recognizing typical group- ings of words. It follows that where words are used atypically we may be considerably slowed down. When metaphor experiments ﬁnd variations in informants’ reaction times, these may be due to atypical language pat- terns in texts, rather than to the added dif- ﬁculty (or ease) of processing ﬁgurative or innovative language. An example can be found in work by Keysar et al. (2000). In a complex series of experiments, Keysar and his co-researchers investigated the view that people use con- ceptual mappings to understand conven- tional expressions. They concluded that they probably do not, although they may use mappings in interpreting nonconven- tional expressions. One of their experiments investigated whether novel metaphorical expressions elicit conceptual mappings and included a comparison between reaction\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 285 times to a novel metaphorical sentence, when it followed a short text consisting of “stock phrases” versus a short text consisting of “novel metaphors.” Two of the texts used for the experiment were as follows: 1. As a scientist, Tina thinks of her the- ories as her children. She is a pro- liﬁc researcher, conceiving an enormous number of new ﬁndings each year. Tina is currently weaning her latest child. 2. Tina thinks of her theories as her chil- dren. She is a fertile researcher, giving birth to an enormous number of new ﬁndings a year. Tina is currently weaning her latest child. (p. 582) In each text, the ﬁrst sentence makes the metaphorical mapping explicit. According to the researchers, the second sentence of the ﬁrst text contains conventional expressions or “stock phrases”, that is, proliﬁc and con- ceiving, whereas the second sentence of the second text contains novel metaphors, that is, fertile and giving birth. The third sentence of each consists of the same novel metaphor weaning her latest child. (No items were itali- cized in the experiment.) Participants’ reac- tion times to the third sentence in these and two other contexts were measured and com- pared. The assumption appears to be that this ﬁnal sentence is ambiguous between a literal and metaphorical interpretation, and that informants may take different amounts of time to resolve the ambiguity, depending on whether a particular interpretation has been primed by the preceding context. In order to check the researchers’ judg- ments as to the conventionality or other- wise of each expression, 12 native speakers were asked for their views. Many corpus lin- guists would feel that this part of the proce- dure is potentially unsound because of the known unreliability of intuitive judgments in comparison to the examination of natu- rally occurring data (Sinclair, 1991). Corpus investigation suggests that this is indeed a problem for these texts. The experiment makes several assump- tions about usage, including the following: 1. that fertile, used in the second sentence of the second text, is a novel metaphor; 2. that weaning, in the last sentence of each text, is a novel metaphor; 3. that latest child, in the last sentence, is potentially ambiguous between the meanings “a child” and “a set of experi- mental ﬁndings.” Corpus analyses raised problems with each of the three assumptions, showing the following: 1. There are 365 citations of fertile in the corpus, 210 of which refer to land that can bear crops easily. Ninety-seven cita- tions refer to people, animals, or plants. The meaning in this second group of citations is slightly different from that implied by the use of the metaphor in the previous text: fertile in this context tends to refer to the potential to repro- duce rather than the fact of reproducing frequently. Citations include: (3) The operation can rarely be reversed so that the man becomes fertile again. More signiﬁcantly, fertile is not a novel metaphor in the corpus. There are 61 citations in which it appears to be used metaphorically. Metaphorical meanings are linked to each of the two literal mean- ings. The “land” sense seems to motivate the expression fertile ground, which appears 20 times and is always metaphorical, in citations such as (4) There is little doubt that growing dis- content offers fertile ground for gains by the opposition. The “capacity to reproduce” sense seems to motivate the use of fertile in citations such as (5) For once, the artist’s fertile imagination failed him. 2. Wean and its inﬂections occur 188 times in the corpus. There are ﬁve citations\n286 ALICE DEIGNAN taking the form seen in the last line of the experimental texts: that is, followed by a direct object which is clause-ﬁnal. All of these are literal, for instance: (6) She didn’t imagine any trouble weaning her daughter. All occur in relatively specialized texts, dis- cussing feeding in child care, and on this limited evidence it appears that it would be unusual to use wean in a more general discussion about a person’s children, as is suggested by the experimental texts. This in itself might affect participants’ decoding time. Although this lexico-grammatical pattern never appears with a metaphorical mean- ing of wean, other patterns are found in metaphorical uses relatively frequently, in citations such as: (7) . . . to help fund jobs and wean single mums off welfare beneﬁt and back into work. (8) . . . wean people away from exclusive reliance on the automobile. There is a further fairly frequent pattern, in which wean seems to mean not “take away from,” but “be raised on,” in metaphorical citations such as: (9) . . . staffed by mechanics and engineers weaned on the local racing scene. According to these data, Keysar et al.’s asser- tion that the use of wean in the ﬁnal sen- tence is a novel metaphor is true in the strictest sense, in that no metaphors were found in the corpus taking this exact lexico- grammatical form. However, wean, like fer- tile, has several metaphorical uses which are closely related semantically to the uses given them in the texts. It seems possible that these metaphorical uses might be acti- vated in participants during the experiments. This could lead to one of two problems: ﬁrst, participants might not be processing either or both words as novel but as con- ventional metaphors. Second, in doing so they might be slowed down by the slightly atypical lexico-grammatical environments in which they appear in the texts. 3. Finally, the experiment appears to depend on an assumption that latest child is ambiguous between a literal and a metaphorical interpretation. Corpus data suggest that in fact the metaphorical interpretation is probably favored, because the collocation latest + child almost never occurs. There are 16,016 citations of child in the corpus; latest appears in the immediate left slot just twice, in the expressions “latest child rapist” and “latest child prodigy.” In contrast, youngest appears 41 times before child; this would seem to be the usual way of talking about the child most recently born to someone. This impression is supported by an examination of collocates of latest and youngest: latest occurs 6,524 times in the corpus. The top immediate right lexical collocates, in order of frequency, are ﬁgures, development, book, round, news, album, ﬁlm, reports, edition, and technology, words which seem to be in the same semantic domain as the intended metaphorical meaning of child in the experiment. Youngest occurs 883 times in the corpus, and its top right lex- ical collocates are son, daughter, child, player, member, prime minister, person, children, brother, and boy. It seems likely therefore that the collocation latest child will strongly suggest a nonconventional meaning of child, regardless of the preceding context, because the typical language pattern is broken. The experimental text analyzed here is not unusual in containing instances of lan- guage that behave in different ways in the corpus from the researchers’ assumptions. Corpus analyses of other experimental data, as well as elicited data, have shown similar discrepancies (Deignan, 2005a). Research involving experimental and elicited data has made many important contributions to knowledge about how metaphors work, but naturally occurring data are a necessary\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 287 complement, and it is to be hoped that the insights from the study of naturally occur- ring language can inform and develop exper- imental work. I have given two examples of corpus data adding to and raising questions about intuitively generated linguistic data, in the language about anger discussed in the Intro- duction, and in Keysar et al.’s data here. Examples of such discrepancies can be found easily, in virtually every corpus analysis, and researchers need to be aware of the unreli- ability of elicited and invented data. How- ever, this is not by any means the most important contribution of corpus linguistics to metaphor studies. A number of signiﬁcant insights into metaphor use have resulted from the accumulation of linguistic details through corpus study, and the most far- reaching of these will be described in the following sections. Metaphor as a Textual and Social Phenomenon It is now widely agreed that metaphor is a cognitive phenomenon, and a mass of evi- dence has been accumulated to support the proposition that many linguistic metaphors, especially those that are most convention- alized and embedded in the language, are realizations of mental mappings. However, corpus linguistic research suggests that a mental mapping theory of metaphor is not in itself sufﬁcient to account for the pat- terns found in language. Other factors seem to contribute to shaping the linguistic data. Charteris-Black (2004) uses corpus data to claim that metaphor use is shaped by societal and ideological factors as well as cognitive ones. In the following subsections, I draw on his and other corpus research to claim that metaphor use is inﬂuenced by linguistic, genre, cultural, and ideological factors. That is, metaphor is textual and social as well as cognitive. Metaphor and Linguistic Context When we choose a metaphor to express an idea, we are inﬂuenced by the other words in our utterance. Corpus evidence indicates that linguistic metaphors are constrained by their co-text, in common with other features of language in use. I examined concordance data for blow and price, identiﬁed their fre- quent collocates, and from these identiﬁed and studied the most frequent ﬁxed expres- sions containing the words (Deignan, 1999b, 2005b). I found that most ﬁxed expres- sions are used with either the literal or the metaphorical meaning of blow or price, more usually the metaphorical meaning. It is much rarer for an expression to be used in both source and target domains, even when there is nothing in its intrinsic meaning that ties it to either domain. Examples include heavy blow, and pay a high price, which are com- monly found with metaphorical meanings but rarely with literal ones. Typical citations are: (10) The announcement will be a heavy blow to investors. (11) Top cop Dr. Ian Oliver appears to have paid a high price for the scandal sur- rounding his police force. The under- pressure Chief Constable, 58, looks 10 years older than he should. There are some apparent exceptions. However, in these cases, linguistic differ- ences can generally be found at a more detailed linguistic level. For instance, at any price is used with both literal and metaphor- ical meanings of price, as in the following citations. (12) All the great works of that period are either owned by museums or private collectors who won’t sell at any price. (13) In court she was portrayed as jeal- ous, violent, paranoid, spiteful, bent on destroying her spouse at any price. Corpus analysis shows that the metaphorical meaning of at any price is more usual, and where a literal meaning is intended, this is always signaled by the presence of a word from the semantic ﬁeld of buying and selling, sell in citation (12). Exceptions are found where a pat- tern is exploited for creative purposes. It might be expected that a literal expression\n288 ALICE DEIGNAN would sometimes be used inventively with a metaphorical meaning, but in fact, the reverse seems more common. Fixed expres- sions associated with the target domain are used with a source domain meaning or allu- sion for creative or comic effect. For exam- ple, an advertisement in a British newspaper for the Edinburgh Theatre Festival Fringe events features a photograph of an acrobat performing a back somersault, with the cap- tion, “No need to bend over backwards to get to the Fringe” (The Independent, March 19, 2005). Corpus data conﬁrm that bend over backwards is rarely used with the literal meaning that is alluded to here. The association of collocations and ﬁxed expressions with a single meaning of a word is not predicted by cognitive metaphor the- ory. Indeed, cognitive theory could be taken to suggest the opposite: if a source domain including the logical relations between its entities is mapped onto a target domain, we would expect a replication of the log- ical relationships. At the linguistic level, this would imply that the same expressions would appear in both domains, realizing the underlying conceptual relationships. Developments in linguistic theory, notably work by Sinclair (for example, 1991, 2004) provide a plausible explanation. Sinclair claims that collocation is one of the most important forces in shaping language in use (1991). The notion of “chunking,” or producing and decoding text in units of several words, was described above. Work in corpus lexicography (for instance, Moon, 1987), has shown that each meaning of a word has its own distinctive sets of collo- cates. This implies that once a particular metaphor is chosen, its collocates will be partly predetermined. If a speaker wants to talk about the disadvantages of a situation in terms of the metaphor pay, other metaphors such as high and price are likely to spring to mind. Linguistic convention is thus a factor in metaphor choice and patterning. Metaphor and Genre A second factor affecting metaphor choice is genre, speciﬁcally the topic and purpose of a text. Charteris-Black (2000) found a num- ber of metaphors which are more frequent in a corpus of The Economist than in the Bank of English sub-corpus of general magazines. Quantitative data alone did not enable him to do this. For instance, the words fat and diet are more frequent in the general magazine corpus, which might suggest that the two words would have little role in conveying meanings speciﬁc to The Economist. How- ever, a detailed examination shows that this is not the case. In the Economist, both fat and diet tend to have specialized metaphorical meanings relating to the economy. Citations include: They forced importers to slash their once fat margins. State-owned ﬁrms surviving on a diet of subsidy and protection. (2000: 155) The differences in meanings of these words across the two corpora could be attributed to topic. Articles about literal diets would be less expected in The Economist than in a general interest magazine. Corpus research by Skorczynska (2001) and Skorczynska and Deignan (2006) shows that topic is not the only aspect of genre that affects metaphor choice. Purpose is also a factor. They compared metaphor use in a corpus of popular periodicals, including The Economist, with a corpus of research journals on the same topic and found that there is relatively little metaphor use in common. In their sample corpus of research journals, consisting of around 30,000 words, which they searched by hand, they found 21 metaphorically used terms realizing six source domains, and two one- shot metaphors. In their sample periodi- cals corpus of the same size, they found 72 metaphorically used terms (types), real- izing 11 source domains. Five of the six source domains found in the research cor- pus were also found in the periodicals corpus: HUMAN/ANIMAL LIFE, MECHANICS, JOURNEY, GAMES and HUNTING. How- ever, only four linguistic metaphors, grow, growth, ﬂow, and game, were common to both sample corpora. The source domains of JOURNEY and HUNTING are realized in\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 289 both corpora but do not share a single linguistic realization. For example, in the research corpus, JOURNEY is realized by free ride and free rider, while in the periodi- cals corpus it is realized by bump, derail, race, road, station, and train. This would be unexpected if topic were the sole factor determining metaphor use, because the two corpora included texts on a number of very similar topics. The researchers analyzed the context and function of the metaphors in detail and concluded that the purpose of the text seems to be an important factor in deter- mining choice of metaphor. For instance, different metaphors are chosen to illustrate economic concepts to a lay reader than those that are used to model theory to a co- researcher. Metaphor Is Culturally Determined Cross-linguistic corpus work has demon- strated that sometimes different languages use different metaphors to talk about the same topic. Differences in metaphor choice have been attributed to several cultural factors: the salience of source domains and differences in attitudes toward the source or target domain. Boers and Demecheleer (1997) found evidence for the ﬁrst fac- tor. They analyzed metaphors from eco- nomics discourse, using corpora of English, French, and Dutch texts. Their corpora were small, at around 43,000 words of English and 20,000 words each of French and Dutch, but were highly compara- ble. They studied the linguistic realizations of metaphors from three source domains: PATHS, HEALTH, and WAR and found lin- guistic metaphors traceable to each of the three source domains in all three languages. The source domains were used across the three languages with different levels of fre- quency. Health metaphors are three times as frequent in French as in Dutch, while path metaphors are more frequent, though not as markedly so, in English than in the other two languages. English prefers path metaphors to the other two domains, while war metaphors are preferred in French and Dutch. The researchers speculate that this could be due to the British seafaring past. They also found that national stereotypes are evident in metaphor choice. For instance, the British texts used gardening metaphors more than three times as frequently as the French texts, while the French texts used nearly ﬁve times as many food metaphors as the English ones. These ﬁndings suggest that a similar range of metaphors is available in the three languages, but the salience of the source domain in the speakers’ culture inﬂuences the choice they make. Semino (2002) ﬁnds different groups of metaphors used in her corpora of English and Italian newspapers and claims that these reﬂect the different attitudes held by the two cultures towards the topic, and occa- sionally toward the source domain (2002). She analyzed data from early 1999, when the new pan-European currency, the Euro, was introduced. Britain and Italy have strik- ingly different attitudes toward the Euro. Britain did not join the Eurozone, and a number of British people remain strongly opposed to greater integration with the other economies of Europe. Italy, in contrast, is generally Europhile, and the Euro was adopted enthusiastically. Semino found that these different attitudes are reﬂected in the metaphors used in the two corpora. The cor- pora showed a number of shared metaphors from the source domains of BIRTH, JOUR- NEYS, CONTAINERS, SPORT, and DREAMS. However, these tend to be exploited differ- ently by the media in the two countries. For instance, in Italy, the birth metaphor was accompanied by enthusiasm for the metaphorical baby’s health, while in Britain the metaphor was either undeveloped or had negative overtones. In one British example, the Euro is compared to a “heavyweight” baby that is not shown in public, a ref- erence to the three-year delay before the introduction of Euro coins and notes. As Semino points out, different uses of the “baby” metaphor may also reﬂect the Ital- ians’ very positive attitudes toward babies and children, so in this case, the different lin- guistic metaphors reﬂect values in the source domain as well as attitudes toward the target domain.\n290 ALICE DEIGNAN Metaphor Is Ideological A central claim in contemporary metaphor theory is that metaphor is ideological. Lakoff presented this argument at the start of the ﬁrst Persian Gulf War in the strongest terms, claiming “Metaphors can kill” (1991). Cor- pus ﬁndings are completely consistent with his argument. Koller studied the ideological use of metaphor within merger and acqui- sition texts (2003). She built her own spe- cialized corpus, consisting of 164,000 words of articles published between 1996 and 2000 in Business Week, The Economist, The Finan- cial Times, and Fortune. Koller searched for metaphors from the source domains of WAR/ VIOLENCE and MARRIAGE/ROMANCE, con- cordancing 48 lemmas from these domains and establishing which words and expres- sions are used frequently with metaphori- cal meanings. VIOLENCE metaphors in her corpus included bruise, killer, and victim as well as expressions more closely associated with war, such as takeover battle and ﬁght off corporate raiders. MARRIAGE/ROMANCE metaphors include woo and ﬂirt. Koller’s fre- quency counts showed that WAR metaphors are more than three times more frequent than MARRIAGE ones. The initial, quanti- tative part of her study thus revealed sev- eral important facts about the metaphors of mergers and acquisition discourse which would have been difﬁcult to retrieve in other ways. As in much corpus work, the quantitative ﬁndings formed a starting point for the qualitative study of metaphors in text. In some cases, this showed a con- ﬂation of WAR/VIOLENCE and MARRIAGE/ ROMANCE metaphors in the same utter- ances, for example: At a recent conference [he] joked that if suitors in the telecom industry now need fat chequebooks and a bunch of ﬂowers. And if gallantry is rebuffed? Call in the tanks. (2003: 193) Koller concludes that the large number of metaphors from the male-oriented source domain of WAR/VIOLENCE help to con- struct the discourse as male and thus, in her view, as excluding of women. The male orientation is strengthened by the use of MARRIAGE/ROMANCE metaphors to talk about mergers and acquisitions. In these metaphors, the dominant company is assumed to be male, while the company in the weaker position is assumed to be female. Charteris-Black’s (2000) ﬁndings from a corpus of economics discourse are consis- tent with an ideological view of metaphor. He found that animate metaphors are used to talk about economies in general terms, the main source domains being sickness and health, and the human life cycle and family. The sickness and health metaphor is realized in citations such as: As the bank continued to haemorrhage both deposits and loans. (2000: 155) Charteris-Black argues that such metaphors imply that the economy is animate but pas- sive and that “this perception permits the economist to present himself as a doctor or surgeon who can take an active role in inﬂuencing economic events” (ibid.). Other typical linguistic realizations of animate metaphors include healthy, ailing, infant, and parent. However, in talking about the market and market movements more speciﬁcally, different sets of metaphors are used, and these tend to be inanimate. For instance, the market is described as a liquid, in metaphor- ical expressions such as ﬂoat and buoyant, and as a ball, in expressions such as bounce back and rebound. In contrast to animate metaphors, which suggest an entity that has its own volition but is nonetheless subject to some control, inanimate metaphors present the markets as natural forces, beyond human control, a message which can be detected in the use of drop and rebound in the following citation: After such a sharp drop in growth some rebound seems inevitable. (Charteris- Black 2000: 158) Charteris-Black’s (2004) comparative anal- ysis of metaphor use across corpora of a range of different genres conﬁrms his view that metaphor is always evaluative, never neutral. He uses corpus techniques to ana- lyze metaphor use on the Old and New\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 291 Testaments, and in the Koran, as well as in U.S. presidential speeches and British party manifestos. His comparisons reveal ways that metaphors are used to present an ideo- logical message in different but related texts. For instance, the different focuses in the Old and New Testaments can be seen in its metaphors. The Old Testament contains many more metaphors that stress God’s ret- ribution. The corpus studies described here present a view of metaphor that is consistent with contemporary metaphor theory but which adds to it. Much current research stresses the cognitive dimension of metaphor, and tends to explore its informational content. Corpus linguistic studies show that the informational message to be conveyed is only one of the factors that affect metaphor choice. Other factors are textual, that is, the linguistic co-text, and social, that is, the function of the text, and its cultural and ideological context. Metaphor as the Product of Dynamic Interactions As well as enriching our understanding of the mechanisms generating linguistic metaphors, a corpus view of metaphor can contribute more directly to contemporary metaphor theory. In this section, two lines of research are described, both of which suggest that metaphor is a dynamic phe- nomenon. Interaction between Source and Target Domains Corpus evidence points to an interac- tion between source and target domains, such as is proposed in the blending the- ory (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002). Deignan (2005a) examined the grammatical behav- ior of linguistic metaphors and compared this with the behavior of their literal counterparts, focusing on realizations of HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. She found that there is a tendency for words that are nouns in the source domain to be used as verbs in the target domain. For instance, horse, hound, ferret, squirrel, wolf, and pig are all commonly verbs in the tar- get domain of human behavior. This gram- matical difference is probably due to the different inherent structures of the source and target domains. Animals dominate the source domain, while in the target domain, ways of behaving are more prominent than entities. The source domain is therefore pre- dominantly realized through nouns, while the target domain requires a rich range of verbs and some adjectives. Some source domain verbs and adjectives such as bark, growl, and vicious are used to talk about human behavior, but they do not seem to be the most frequent linguistic realiza- tions of the mapping. Lakoff’s invariance hypothesis (1993) would imply that source domain entities would not form part of the mapping because they do not have direct correspondences in the target domain. Many potential target domain meanings would therefore remain unrealized through this particular conceptual metaphor. Instead, what seems to happen is that source domain nouns undergo grammatical transformation to become verbs, enabling them to be used to talk about behavior. One result of grammatical differences between source and target domains is that the logical relationships between entities in each domain differ. For instance, the rela- tionship between dog and hunt and between hound and hunt is between agent and verb in the source domain. The relationship is syntagmatic, as the following corpus citations show: (14) Rabbits were hunted with fast mongrel dogs. (15) . . . issues such as hunting with hounds. However, in the target domain of human behavior, dog and hound are not used as nouns. Both are verbal, as in the following citations: (16) She has been dogged by tragedy. (17) He complains of being hounded by intol- erable pressure on and off the ﬁeld. Their metaphorical meaning is hypony- mous to pursue. Although they are not\n292 ALICE DEIGNAN synonymous to hunt, as used in the follow- ing citation, they are in a paradigmatic rather than a syntagmatic relationship with it: (18) [He] is now out of prison and thinks he will be hunted by the underworld because they will look on him as a grass. Similarly, squirrel and hoard have a syntag- matic relationship in the source domain, generally subject–verb, but in the target domain of human behavior, they are almost synonymous. Corpus analysis of animal metaphors suggests that grammatical differ- ences between domains, and corresponding differences between logical relationships are the norm for this conceptual mapping (Deignan, 2005a). Similar patterns have been observed by other corpus researchers. Koller (2003) notes differences in word class between source and target domains, while Cameron (2003) ﬁnds high levels of verbal metaphors in her corpus. These ﬁndings have implications for a strong view of metaphorical mapping, because they suggest that a one-to-one map- ping of logical correspondences between entities is less common than sometimes assumed in the theoretical literature. In par- ticular, they challenge an interpretation of conceptual metaphor theory that suggests that the target domain is largely constructed by source domain correspondences. Corpus data suggest that the inherent structure of the target domain does not only constrain the mapping, it helps to shape it. Metaphor and Metonymy Corpus research by Deignan (2005a, b) and Charteris-Black (2003) contributes to the discussion about the interaction between metaphor and metonymy. Corpus data sug- gest a very large number of linguistic expres- sions generated by this interaction, possi- bly more than generated by either pure metaphor or pure metonymy. It also seems that there are more types of interaction than in the original framework proposed by Goossens (1995). Goossen’s important insight into the interaction between metaphor and met- onymy was developed from a study of dictio- nary data. The examples used in dictionaries tend to be simpliﬁed, meaning that impor- tant linguistic patterns may be lost. Deignan (2005b) used the Bank of English to search for lexical items from a number of source domains. She investigated Goossen’s cate- gories, ﬁnding that metaphor from metonymy was by far the most frequent and that within this category more detailed distinc- tions can be drawn. Corpus data also show that individual expressions may belong in different categories depending on how they are used. Charteris-Black demonstrates the potential ambiguity between literal and ﬁg- urative readings of expressions such as lick one’s lips (2003). The following citations of keep an eye on also demonstrate a range of interpretations: (19) This means that while Julia is cooking she can still keep an eye on their two young children. (20) [The job] entails collecting the rent and keeping an eye on some housing associa- tion ﬂats. (21) Often a scheme will need backing for several years. During this time, the Field Director [will] keep an eye on its progress. In citation (19), the expression seems literal, because it is certainly intended to refer to the physical act of watching (though it contains a metonymical use of eye to denote the act of watching). However, there is more than a purely literal meaning, and the expres- sion also connotes caring: Julia is not sim- ply watching her children, she is doing so in order to ensure their safety. This use of keep an eye on is therefore metonymic, because one action is used to stand for a wider pat- tern of behavior. In citation (21), the expres- sion is very unlikely to have any literal reading, because its object, progress, is abstract in this context, and it is there- fore an instance of Goossen’s metaphor from metonymy. In citation (20), the expression is ambiguous in that it could refer to either literal watching, or it could be nonliteral, if it refers to caring for ﬂats in a more gen- eral sense, for instance, ensuring that repairs\nCORPUS LINGUISTICS AND METAPHOR 293 are carried out. The source domain of body parts and actions generates a number of expressions that are ambiguous and context- dependent in this way (Moon, 1998). As in studies described in the previous sec- tion, corpus data suggest a rich, dynamic, and context-bound view of ﬁgurative language. Conclusion In this chapter, it has been shown that corpus analysis can reveal many linguistic details that could be passed over in the examination of single texts, and might not be observed at all when data are elicited rather than gath- ered from language in use. Even when these details are noted, it is easy to dismiss them as insigniﬁcant, especially if they interfere with apparently tidy patterns. However, patterns like differences in part of speech and ambi- guity between metonymy and metaphor are so frequently found in the corpus that they should perhaps be regarded as regularities in themselves. It is unsafe to assume that these linguistic details are not manifesta- tions of deeper level metaphorical features. At the very least, they need to be studied in their own right and the implications fed back into metaphor theory. Studying linguis- tic metaphors in naturally occurring data has not produced ﬁndings that contradict con- temporary metaphor theory, but it has sug- gested that other factors affect metaphor choice. In common with other features of language in use, metaphors are shaped by their linguistic context, genre, culture, and ideology as well as their informational content. In critiquing experimental approaches to metaphor research, I argued that the col- locational and syntactic patterns in which words are found are an important cue in readers’ searches for meaning. This means that reading-time data from texts which con- tain atypical patterns may not be an indica- tor of the complexity of processing ﬁgurative or literal language. It is therefore important for reading-time experiments to use natural- istic language. Because even native speakers of a language cannot reliably access colloca- tional and syntactic patterns using unaided intuition, it is very difﬁcult to invent natural- istic sentences and short texts. Corpus data would form a useful resource in the design of such work. Corpus linguistics is a relatively young ﬁeld and has been applied to the study of metaphor for only a decade or so; it is to be expected that the ways in which corpora can contribute to our under- standings of metaphor will continue to broaden.

It is commonly assumed – by literary critics, psychologists of art, and philosophers alike (e.g., Shklovsky, in Lemon & Reis, 1965; Van Peer, 1986) – that the stylistic properties of poetic language, particularly ﬁgurative expressions, deliber- ately pervert or ﬂout regular cognitive prin- ciples so as to achieve the effects unique to poetic discourse – the creation of such effects being the goal of all poetic discourse. According to Shklovsky, one of the chief pro- ponents of this view, art seeks “to make the object ‘unfamiliar,’ to make forms difﬁcult, to increase the difﬁculty and length of per- ception, because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be pro- longed” (Shklovsky, in Lemon & Reis, 1965). However, many ﬁgurative expressions that appear in poetic discourse demonstrate a puzzling phenomenon (which represents, in a nutshell, the puzzle of artistic creativ- ∗ This research was supported by The Israel Science Foundation administered by The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, no. 939/02. ity in general). On the one hand, they are novel, creative, imaginative, and aestheti- cally pleasing; on the other hand, taken in isolation, they are, in many cases, eas- ily understood and comprehended, even for ordinary readers. How can we account for the fact that these expressions succeed in communicating in spite of their novelty? The general answer I propose is that poetic ﬁgures conform to certain cognitive principles that allow their ideas to be communicated. This general statement will be illustrated by three types of ﬁgurative language, namely, simile, zeugma, and synaesthetic metaphors. My goal is to examine how and to what extent one fun- damental cognitive principle, namely, the directionality principle, affects the use of these three ﬁgurative types. Another goal is to extend previous cognitive research into poetic ﬁgurative language (e.g., Lakoff & Turner 1989) in two major respects. First, to broaden the study of ﬁgurative types by including three ﬁgurative types that have received relatively little attention in the literature. Second, to examine some addi- tional aspects of the distribution in poetic 295\n296 YESHAYAHU SHEN discourse and the comprehension of the three poetic ﬁgurative types that have not been previously examined, and which may suggest an even greater conformity of poetic ﬁgures to cognitive constraints than has been previously acknowledged. The Directionality Principle Figurative thought conforms to certain prin- ciples, such as systematicity (cf. Gentner, 1983) and global mapping (Lakoff & John- son, 1980; Tourangeau & Sternberg, 1982), which have been explored in some depth. Of these principles, the directionality of map- ping is the most fundamental principal and therefore one of the most systematically and comprehensively studied. This principle states: The metaphorical source domain tends to represent a conceptually more accessible (i.e., more concrete or more salient) concept than the target. There have been a great many stud- ies in both linguistics and psycholinguis- tics, some of which have not only substanti- ated this principle but taken it several steps further. It has thus been suggested that in many languages ﬁgurative expressions tend, in accordance with this principle, to become conventionalized (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Sweetser, 1990). It has also been claimed that it is the directionality of mapping prin- ciple that largely determines the direction of diachronic meaning extension (Sweetser, 1990; Traugott, 1982). In addition, there have been several psycholinguistic experiments, indicating that structures consistent with the directionality principle are consistently viewed as more natural and comprehensible as well as being easier to recall (Johnson & Malgady, 1979; Ortony, 1979; Ortony et al., 1985; Shen, 1992; Tversky, 1977). This principle, then, appears to be funda- mental to ﬁgurative thought and cognition in general (see, for example, Shen (1997), who views it as a special case of the “cognitive reference point” principle). Compatible and Clashing Expressions Given this principle, we may distin- guish between two types of metaphorical structures, namely, compatible and clash- ing ones. A compatible structure (COS) is a metaphorical expression whose linguistic structure is compatible with the cognitive principle, as in the simile “education is like a ladder.” Here, the noun “education,” being the grammatical subject of the comparison, represents the metaphor target, while “a ladder,” being the comparison predicate, is the metaphor source. Since the target (“education”) is more abstract than the source (“a ladder”) this comparison is com- patible with the directionality principle, which favors this direction of mapping. A clashing structure (CLS) is a metaphor- ical expression whose linguistic structure clashes with the cognitive principle, for example, “a ladder is like education.” Here, the target (the grammatical subject) rep- resents a more concrete concept than the source, thus clashing with the conceptual principle. The main question that I address is the following: To what extent does the con- ceptual directionality principle (DP) affect the use of metaphorical expressions of the three ﬁgurative types analyzed here? I will investigate this question with respect to two major issues, namely, the distribution and comprehension of the three ﬁgurative types. In particular, I will address the following questions: 1. Distribution in poetic discourse: Are COS ﬁgurative expressions used more fre- quently than CLS ones even in poetic discourse, an area in which ﬁgurative language is used in the most creative way possible? And, if so, does this hold true for the poetry of all languages, periods, and schools? 2. Comprehension. This issue is divided into two related sets of questions: i. Are COS ﬁgurative expressions cog- nitively more basic and easier to understand than CLS ones? That is, is it easier to assign meaning to COS\nMETAPHOR AND POETIC FIGURES 297 than to CLS expressions? Are they viewed as a more natural or more meaningful construct? Are they eas- ier to recall? ii. Does the DP give rise to an “inver- sion effect” in subjects’ interpreta- tion and recall of CLS expressions? That is, do subjects tend to invert the target and base terms in interpreta- tion and recall of the three ﬁgurative types? (see also Chiappe et al. 2003; Glucksberg et al. 1997). Simile Similes are metaphorical comparisons com- posed of two nominal terms, one of which belongs to the target and the other to the source domain. Accordingly, in the sim- ile education is like a ladder, “education” is the target domain and “ladder” the source domain. Similes have been studied exten- sively in various ﬁelds, such as literary stud- ies (e.g., Fishelov, 1996), philosophy and lin- guistics (e.g., Beardsley, 1981), and cognitive psychology (Glucksberg et al., 1997; Chi- appe et al., 2003; Ortony et al., 1985). The issues investigated include description and interpretation of speciﬁc similes, descrip- tion of the various forms similes can take in poetry (Fishelov, 1996), and attempts to describe the differences between similes and metaphors and the psychological mecha- nisms involved in their processing (Glucks- berg & Keysar, 1990; Ortony et al., 1985). A major observation made in many of these studies (notably, Ortony et al., 1985, elaborated by Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990; Chiappe et al., 2003; Glucksberg et al., 1997) is that similes (not necessarily as opposed to metaphors) are directional com- parisons characterized (in accordance with the directionality principle) by a preference to map more accessible (salient, typical, concrete) concepts into less accessible ones rather than the other way around, as the previous example, education is like a ladder, illustrates. In what follows, I will elaborate on this observation with respect to the use of similes in poetic discourse (an issue that has been insufﬁciently discussed in the cog- nitive literature), as well as various compre- hension issues that have not been discussed in past literature. Distribution of similes in poetic discourse. While most studies in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics have focused on non- poetic similes (conventional ones or ones artiﬁcially constructed for experimental pur- poses), one question of interest in this chap- ter is whether similes used in poetic dis- course also conform to the directionality principle. Shen (1995) investigated the fre- quency with which the two simile types (COS and CLS) were used in various poetic corpora. I assembled a corpus of 400 simi- les excerpted from the poems of four eras of periods in twentieth century Hebrew poetry, each represented by four of its most promi- nent poets. In order not to prejudice the analysis, not only were the 16 poets markedly different from one another in style, but the similes extracted from their poems were chosen at random. This meant that con- textual factors, whether a particular poem, individual poet, or speciﬁc school of poets, would not affect the structural pattern aris- ing from the study’s results and could thus be discounted when assessing those results. This latter point is supported by the fact that the poetic characteristics of each of the four corpora examined, represent- ing as they did successive periods in the history of Hebrew poetry, were markedly different from, even at odds with, one another. This is a reﬂection of the continual struggle between the poets of different gen- erations – a struggle, incidentally, character- istic of literary evolution in general. Accord- ingly, it would be reasonable to assume that the poets of one generation of Hebrew poets, while rejecting the poetic procliv- ities of their predecessors, would eventu- ally ﬁnd their own poetic strategies being spurned by their immediate successors. This being the case, the four corpora used in the study being poetically antithetically, should, on the face of it, have used a wide range of poetic metaphors noticeably different from one another in terms of COS and CLS dominance.\n298 YESHAYAHU SHEN The similes taken from the poems were analyzed using two measures of accessibility: (1) abstract versus concrete and (2) salience. In terms of abstract versus concrete, a COS simile is one in which the subject, target term X, is more abstract than the predicate, source term Y, as in the simile emptiness (X) like a weight (Y) is heavy on the heart. A CLS simile embodies the opposite case, where the subject target terms are more concrete than the predicate source terms, as in the simile the ﬂowers (X) blossom like a dream (Y). Salience was measured only in those similes where the ground (or shared prop- erty) of the two nominal terms was explic- itly stated, as in the simile a ﬂock of birds leaves behind it a trail like a jet plane, where the ground (leaves a trail behind them) is explicitly stated. In such cases, the degree of salience of the shared property in each of the simile’s terms was assessed. In COS similes, the level of salience is higher in the source term, as, in the previous simile, where a ﬂock of birds leaves a trail like a jet plane, with “jets” (the source term) much more prone to leav- ing trails than “birds” (the target term). In CLS similes, it is the target term that is the more salient of the two. Thus, in the simile the ﬁre is hot like a cloud, the shared property of “hot” is more closely associated with the target term “ﬁre” than with the source term “cloud.” The results of the study were clear-cut: On both counts of accessibility, the number of COS similes greatly exceeded the number of CLS ones. On the abstract versus concrete scale, 95% of the similes were of the COS type and only 5% CLS, while on the salience scale, 73% were COS constructs and 27% CLS ones. To determine whether these ﬁndings apply to the poetic corpora of other lan- guages as well, a similar analysis was carried out on nineteenth and twentieth century Russian and Arabic poetry (see Shen, 2007). The results in both cases produced the same striking pattern, as in which COS similes by far outnumbered CLS similes. This sup- ports the view that even the most creative use of ﬁgurative language, poetic discourse, is subject to cognitive constraints (for further details see Shen, 1997, 2002). COMPREHENSION The ﬁrst comprehension issue is whether the COS similes are cognitively simpler structures than the CLS ones. There is some evidence to suggest an afﬁrmative answer to that question. Thus, Ortony et al. (1985) found that the degree of similar- ity between the terms used in COS simi- les, such as libraries are like gold mines or rage is like a volcano, was considered higher than that for CLS similes such as gold mines are like libraries or a volcano is like rage. Furthermore, COS similes were judged as being more meaningful than CLS ones. Shen (1995) pointed out that not only were COS similes thought to be more natural than CLS ones, but that it took most people longer to interpret CLS similes. In addition, the inter- pretations generated for CLS similes proved to be a great deal more heterogeneous than those provided for COS ones, a clear indi- cation that CLS similes are, indeed, much harder to interpret. Let us now consider a more radical effect the DP might have on the way people com- prehend similes (see also Chiappe et al., 2003; Glucksberg et al., 1997). Arguably, if people’s preference for mapping from a more accessible to a less accessible domain (as suggested by the DP principle) is a strong one, it might result in a radical inversion effect in their comprehension of CLS sim- iles. That is, when people are asked to inter- pret a given CLS simile or retrieve it from memory, they might invert the target and source terms, yielding a structure compati- ble with the DP. To test this possibility, two experiments, a recall and an interpretation generation experiment (Shen & Shalev, in prepara- tion), were conducted. Both experiments employed the same stimuli: two sets of twelve similes, the ﬁrst consisting of COS similes, the second of CLS similes. The COS similes included expressions such as a friend is like an anchor and libraries are like gold\nMETAPHOR AND POETIC FIGURES 299 mines, while the CLS similes simply reversed the order of the nominals in the COS simile, as in an anchor is like a friend and gold mines are like libraries. In each of the two experi- ments, the subjects were read the simile in either the COS or the CLS form. All the similes used in the experiments were the Hebrew equivalent of the ones employed by Ortony in his study of the question of directionality in metaphorical comparisons. Ortony et al. (1985) had estab- lished that COS similes (although they did not use this word for them) have the prop- erty that some of the highly salient proper- ties of the source term match some of the less salient properties of the target term. In the case of a friend is like an anchor, “pro- viding support” – the shared property – is a high-salience characteristic of the source term “anchor” and a low salience character- istic of the target term “friend” (for a more detailed argument, see Shen, 1995). RECALL Subjects ﬁrst read a list of similes (half COS and half CLS). After an interval of a few minutes, they were asked to write down, as accurately as possible, what they could recall from the comparisons they had read. The subjects’ responses were then analyzed for the number of inversions they performed on the original similes they had encoun- tered in the initial phase. As hypothesized, the number of inversions subjects made for the CLS was signiﬁcantly higher than those made for the COS similes. In fact, not even a single COS simile (out of the 12 ana- lyzed) was inverted in recall by most sub- jects, whereas seven out of the 12 CLS simi- les had instances of inversion. INTERPRETATION GENERATION The aim of this experiment was to examine the effect of the DP on simile comprehen- sion, using a different task. One might argue that even if the DP inﬂuences recall of CLS similes, it must not affect the comprehension process at its initial phases, when it is not necessary to use delayed recall. The present experiment was intended to investigate this possibility. The subjects in this experiment were given the same set of items that had been used in the recall experiment and were asked to provide a one-sentence interpretation for each simile. Their responses were then ana- lyzed for the number of inversions of the noun phrases in the interpretation. The responses were classiﬁed into two groups, “preserving” and “inverting” responses. Pre- serving responses are those in which the target and source terms of the original sim- ile were preserved in the subject’s response. For example, one preserving response for the simile A friend is like an anchor was “A friend helps you as an anchor helps the boat.” Other examples of preserving responses included “a lecture makes you sleep like a sleeping pill,” for the simile a lecture is like a sleeping pill; and, “the books in the library are worth as much as treasure found in a gold mine,” for the simile a library is like a gold mine. Inverted interpretations are those that reverse the original simile’s target and source positions. For instance, the simile an anchor is like a friend was interpreted variously as “like the anchor that keeps a vessel from drifting away, so a friend too can act like an anchor” or “a friend can be like an anchor if you have a close friend.” An instance of an inverted interpretation for the simile a beehive is like a university was the response “a university has a lot of departments and a lot of students, just as there are a great many compartments and bees in a beehive.” For the simile a book is like a beam inverted inter- pretations included: “a book is like a beam for the soul” and “reading a good book is like a warm beam on a rainy day: pleasant, sur- prising and enjoyable.” We hypothesized that the number of inverting responses generated for CLS would be signiﬁcantly higher than those gen- erated for COS. This prediction was fully conﬁrmed. Thus all 12 COS similes gener- ated preserving responses, whereas 10 out of the 12 CLS similes generated invert- ing responses, in full accordance with our\n300 YESHAYAHU SHEN prediction. Another striking characteristic of the responses generated by the subjects was that only eight of the 336 responses gener- ated for the 12 COS similes were inverting responses. These results show a very robust pattern of inverting the CLS while preserv- ing the COS. Zeugma The next ﬁgure to be addressed, namely, the zeugma, allows us to examine the effect of the DP on the structure of metaphorical sen- tences other than similes. A zeugma is a ﬁg- ure of speech in which a word is made to govern two other elements in such a way that a different sense relationship is obtained in each case. Examples are “He packed his shirts and sorrow” and “She caught an air- plane and a husband.” In both of these cases, one term (“packed” or “caught”) stands in the same syntactical relation to two other terms (“shirt” and “sorrow” in the ﬁrst instance, “airplane” and “husband” in the second), but with a different meaning in each case. There are two ways in which such zeug- mas can be presented. In one case, the more salient term is introduced ﬁrst, followed by the less salient one, while in the other, the less salient term precedes the more salient one. Accordingly, he packed his shirt and sad- ness is an example of the ﬁrst type, and he packed his sadness and shirt is an example of the second. In both cases, it is assumed that the literally used noun (shirt) is more salient then the metaphorical one (sadness), with regard to the shared predicate. Arguably, a structure in which the more salient term occurs ﬁrst is compatible with the directionality principle, while the inverted structure clashes with it. One study supporting this claim is the study of Kelly, Bock, and Keil (1986) of the relation between salience (as measured by a term’s prototypicality within a given category) and sentence structure using recall and prefer- ence ratings. When presented with two sen- tences, such as The man bought an orange and a lemon in the grocery store and The man bought a lemon and an orange in the grocery store, most of the subjects in Kelly et al.’s study judged the ﬁrst sentence, in which “orange” – the salient (prototypical) term in the category “fruit” – preceded “lemon” – the less salient term – to be the more nat- ural one. Furthermore, Kelly et al. noted that when recalling zeugmas that reversed the “normal” order, the subjects consistently inverted the original zeugma by position- ing the prototypical terms before the non- prototypical ones. According to Kelly et al., this preference arises from the greater “cognitive accessibility” of the prototypical terms. Thus, the precedence-of-the-salient- item rule is compatible with the directional- ity principle. This clearly shows that a COS zeugma is one in which the more salient term precedes the less salient one, while a CLS zeugma one in which the less salient term precedes the more salient one. Having distinguished between COS and CLS zeugmas, we will now discuss the distri- bution of these two types in poetic discourse and how they are comprehended. DISTRIBUTION Two large-scale ﬁeld studies, one conducted in 1997, the other in 2002, and both ana- lyzing various poetic corpora, supported the contention that, regardless of language, period, or school of poetry, poets use more COS than CLS zeugmas (see Shen, 1997, 2002). In 1997, Shen assembled a sample of 350 zeugmas taken from Hebrew poems written between 1900 and 1980. Each of the poems belongs to one of four deﬁning periods in modern Hebrew poetry, which were markedly different from one another in their poetic characteristics. Nevertheless, as in the case of similes, our hypothesis was that contextual factors, such as the particu- lar poem, poet, or school of poetry in ques- tion, would not affect the structural pattern emerging from the study’s results. In addi- tion, to establish whether the study’s ﬁnd- ings extended beyond the realm of Hebrew poetry to poetry in general, a large num- ber of zeugmas were extracted from the poems of Allen Ginsberg, a poet famous for using zeugmas. The results in both cases were unequivocal: approximately 83% of\nMETAPHOR AND POETIC FIGURES 301 the zeugmas of the Hebrew poets as well as of Ginsberg had literal-ﬁrst order, while only 17% were of the metaphorical-ﬁrst type. Shen (2002) reported on a similar study that attempted to discover whether these structural norms were also valid across time – whether they could, for example, be applied to medieval Hebrew poetry. Using the same methodology as above, Shen extracted 55 zeugmas from the poems of 11 major medieval Hebrew poets. The results con- ﬁrmed the 1997 study’s ﬁndings in that out of 55 zeugmas, 43 (78%) were literal-ﬁrst zeug- mas, and only 11 (22%) were metaphorical- ﬁrst (Shen, forthcoming). The same pattern emerged in the liter- ary corpora of other languages, such as Ara- bic and Russian, pointing to a clear prefer- ence on the part of poets in general for COS type zeugmas (Shen, in press). In sum, the poetic corpora of languages, eras, and schools of poetry employ a great many more COS than CLS zeugmas. COMPREHENSION Various studies have suggested that COS zeugmas are cognitively simpler and easier to comprehend than their CLS counterparts. Shen (1998) found that subjects judged COS zeugmas as more natural than COS ones. Similarly, subjects in another study (Shen & Shalev, in preparation) judged COS as easier to assign interpretations to. More interesting ﬁndings were found in studies that examined the potential “inver- sion effect” on people’s comprehension of CLS zeugmas. As in the case of similes, a recall and an interpretation–generation experiment were used to investigate this possibility. In the recall experiment (Shen, 1998), subjects received a list of items, each con- sisting of a question (e.g., “What did the soldier pack?”) and a related answer that represented a zeugma (e.g., “The soldier packed his shirt/sadness and sadness/shirt”). Half of the sentences were COS zeugmas (e.g., “The soldier packed his shirt and sad- ness”), while the other half had a CLS struc- ture. The experiment was carried out in two stages. First, the subjects were asked to read a list of items such as those described above. Then the experimenter read the ques- tions aloud and asked the subjects to pro- vide the answers from the previous stage as accurately as possible. As hypothesized, sub- jects reversed signiﬁcantly more noncanon- ical (nonliteral ﬁrst) than canonical (lit- eral ﬁrst) structures that they had originally read. The interpretation–generation study (Shen, in preparation) provides further support for the claim that inversion effects occur more frequently in CLS zeugmas than in their COS counterparts. The rationale underlying this experiment is similar to the one presented in the case of the simile. Subjects received a list of zeugmas (similar to the list that was used in the recall exper- iment) and were asked to provide short (single-sentence) interpretations of these expressions. The results were then divided into pre- serving interpretations, which maintained the original ordering of the nouns, and inverting interpretations, which inverted the original order. For example, a typical pre- serving interpretation for the (COS) zeugma The soldier packed his shirt and sorrow was “The soldier packed his shirt while blocking his feelings”; and for the zeugma Dana peeled the wallpaper and the memories, “Dana peeled the wallpaper and erased the memories.” Inverted responses for the CLS zeugma The soldier packed his sorrow and shirt included interpretations such as “while packing his shirts he thought about his sorrow” and “the soldier prepared to leave while try- ing to overcome his sorrow.” Similarly, the CLS zeugma The baby sipped kisses and milk generated the response “the baby sipped milk and willingly accepted kisses.” On the whole, the number of inverting responses generated by CLS zeugmas was signiﬁcantly higher than those generated for COS zeug- mas (Shen, in preparation). In sum, the results of both the recall and the interpretation–generation experi- ments strongly suggest that the DP radically affects the comprehension of CLS versus COS zeugmas.\n302 YESHAYAHU SHEN Synaesthetic Metaphor Unlike similes and zeugmas, which involve concrete-to-abstract mapping, synaesthesias (e.g., a sweet silence) entail the map- ping of two concrete terms, belonging to two different sensory domains. Synaesthetic metaphors are expressions in which one sensory modality is described in the terms of another. Accordingly, a voice (hearing modality) can be described as sweet (taste modality) or a musical note (again hear- ing modality) as sharp (taste modality). Similarly, colors (sight modality) are often deﬁned as cold or hot (touch modality; see Dann, 1999; Tsur, 1992; Ullmann, 1945). Are certain modalities more liable to be mapped onto others or are all modalities equally prone to mapping? It had previously been suggested (e.g., Shen, 2002; Shen & Cohen, 1998; Ullmann, 1945; Tsur, 1992) that there is a graduated scale of sensory modalities ranging from sight – the “highest” modality – followed by sound, smell, taste, and, ﬁnally, touch – the “lowest” sense). This hierarchy reﬂects salience, as suggested by Shen and Aisenman (2008) and Shen and Gadir (2006; in press), in that “lower” sensory terms are more salient, represent- ing more concrete or more immediate sen- sations. Lower sensory modalities tend to include more experienced-based sensations (i.e., those sensed as a physiological sensa- tion of the experiencer as feeling cold or feel- ing the roughness of a certain texture), while higher ones tend to represent object-based sensations (attributed to the object being perceived); hence, the former are sensed as being more immediate than the latter in that they involve a direct bodily expe- rience of the perceiver (see Shen & Aisen- man 2008; Shen & Gadir, 2006; in press). Furthermore, the lower sensory modalities (touch and taste) involve direct contact between the sensory modality and the object of perception, while the higher ones (hear- ing and vision) do not require such a direct contact. Taken together, these characteristics of the sensory domain suggest that the “lower” the sensory term, the more immediate and concrete is the sensation it represents. Applying the general DP to the case of synaesthetic metaphor yields the principle: The low-to-high structure is cog- nitively a simpler structure than the high- to-low one. Given this principle, we can distinguish between compatible and clashing synaes- thetic metaphors. Thus, a COS-type synaes- thetic metaphor, such as a sweet silence, is one in which the target and source terms are compatible with the cognitive directionality principle. In other words, the head noun, in the target slot, represents a higher sensory modality, while the adjective, positioned in the source slot, represents a lower one. In a CLS synaesthetic metaphor, the opposite holds true. Thus, a sweet silence, in which the head noun (“silence”) represents a higher sensory modality (hearing) than the adjec- tive (“sweet”), which has the modality of taste, is a COS synaesthesia, while a silent sweetness is an example of a CLS synaesthe- sia, as in this case the head noun “sweet- ness” is of lower modality than the adjective “silent.” Having established the distinction between COS and CLS synaesthesias, we can now discuss their distribution in poetic discourse and how they are understood. DISTRIBUTION There have been a large number of studies investigating the distribution of COS versus CLS synaesthesia in both poetic and nonpo- etic discourse. In general, these studies have yielded the robust generalization that COS are much more frequently used than their CLS counterparts – across languages, his- torical periods, genres, and poetic schools. For example, Ullmann (1945) demonstrated this tendency in the English and French poetry of the nineteenth century. Other studies showed the same tendency in mod- ern Hebrew poetry (Shen & Cohen, 1998), Serbo-Croatian poetry and modern Rus- sian poetry (see Shen & Aisenman 2008), Biblical and post-Biblical Hebrew (Shen &\nMETAPHOR AND POETIC FIGURES 303 Gadir, in press), Indonesian (Shen & Gil, in press), Rumanian impressionistic and Hun- garian poetry (Dombi, 1974), and Chinese (Yu, 2003). COMPREHENSION There is some evidence to suggest that COS synaesthesias are cognitively simpler and easier to comprehend than CLS ones. Thus, Shen and Cohen (1998) found that COS are easier to generate interpretations for than their CLS counterparts. Another study (Shen & Aisenman (2008), found that COS synaesthesias are better recalled, judged as being more natural, and judged as easier to generate a context to, than CLS ones. These ﬁndings largely substantiate the claim that COS synaesthetic metaphors are cognitively simpler than CLS metaphors. As with the inversion effect we found for similes and zeugmas, here too there is some initial evidence suggesting that peo- ple tend to invert CLS synaesthesia much more than COS ones. Of particular interest are ﬁndings obtained in two interpretations– generation studies (Shen & Cohen, 1998) that used Hebrew noun–adjective expres- sions as stimuli (in Hebrew the noun pre- cedes the adjective) while the other (Shen & Gadir, in press) used genitive (noun–noun) expressions. Interpretation Generation of Noun–Adjective Constructions The ﬁrst interpretation–generation experi- ment was conducted by Shen and Cohen (1998), with a design similar to that of the interpretation–generation experiments for similes and zeugmas. That experiment used as stimuli metaphorical expressions that appeared in either a comparison con- struction (in the case of similes) or a con- junction construction (in the case of zeug- mas). To broaden our study of the scope of the linguistic forms used in metaphors, the present experiment makes use of a differ- ent linguistic form – the noun–adjective con- struction. This allowed us to see whether the DP also applies to metaphors with other lin- guistic structures. The subjects were presented with a list of synaesthetic metaphors, half of which were COS synaesthesias (e.g., sweet silence), while the other half were CLS ones (e.g., a silent sweetness). They were asked to gener- ate a short interpretation for each one. The responses were analyzed for the frequency of inversion effect. Almost all the inversions (24 out of 25) occurred with the CLS synaes- thesias, while only one case of COS synaes- thesia generated an inversion. For example, the synaesthesias sweet silence and silent sweetness were both given the interpretation “pleasant silence,” which maintained the original target–source divi- sion in the ﬁrst instance (in which the map- ping proceeds from the source domain of taste to the target of sound), but reversed it in the second (in which the mapping is from sound to taste). This suggests that the cognitive preference for mapping the lower onto the higher domain may, under cer- tain conditions, override the default linguis- tic convention, whereby the head noun and adjective of a synaesthetic noun phrase are automatically assigned the target and source positions, respectively. Generating Interpretation for Genitive (Noun–Noun) Structures An even more dramatic inversion effect was found in a subsequent study (Shen & Gadir, in press) that examined the interpretation generated by subjects for a totally different linguistic form – the genitive (noun–noun) construction. Using stimuli items of this type of construction (usually ignored in the psy- cholinguistic study of metaphoric language, which typically focused on either adjective– noun or comparison constructions) allows us to examine whether the DP’s effect cuts across various types of linguistic construc- tions. The genitive always involves two nouns. In Hebrew, the head noun comes ﬁrst and the modiﬁer second. The latter provides some kind of deﬁning information (usually of ownership) about the former. Thus, in the Hebrew genitive construction, the handbag of the teacher “handbag” is the head noun and\n304 YESHAYAHU SHEN “teacher” is the modiﬁer, as the latter char- acterizes the former (i.e., which handbag? The handbag belonging to the teacher). The linguistic rule or convention for the Hebrew genitive is that the head and modiﬁer nouns represent the topic (target) and descriptive (source) concept, respectively (for a few exceptions, see Halevi, 1981). Hence, in the Hebrew phrase the chair of the teacher (again, verbatim translation) the head noun “chair” is the topic (target) concept, while the mod- iﬁer “teacher” is the descriptive source con- cept. In a synaesthetic genitive metaphor, each of the two nouns belongs to a different sen- sory modality, as in the music (sound) of caressing (touch). In terms of the abovemen- tioned rule, the head noun, “music,” is the target, and the modiﬁer, “caressing,” is the source. We can distinguish between two types of synaesthetic genitive metaphors, those that are compatible with the DP and those that clash with it. A compatible geni- tive structure is one in which the tar- get noun (the ﬁrst) belongs to a higher sensory modality than the source (sec- ond) noun, as in the music of caressing. A clashing structure introduces the opposite ordering of the nouns, as in the caress of music. The assumption is that the interpre- tation of a given synaesthesia should, in principle, reﬂect a person’s initial judg- ment about which of the two nouns is the target and which the source concept. Accordingly, if conceptual principles have no bearing on the interpretation of gen- itive synaesthetic expressions, these being affected solely by default linguistic conven- tions, then most interpretations of genitive synaesthesias, whether compatible or clash- ing, will classify the head noun as the tar- get and the modiﬁer as the source domain. This means that the interpretations in the case of clashing synaesthesias will be com- patible with the linguistic rule but not with the conceptual rule. However, if the cognitive bias is stronger than the linguis- tic default convention, a different pattern should emerge. In this case, the interpre- tations should reverse original synaesthe- sia’s target and source domains, by iden- tifying the head noun as the source and the modiﬁer as the target, signiﬁcantly were often greater in clashing synaesthesias than in compatible ones. This is because, the lin- guistic convention accords with the cogni- tive bias in compatible synaesthesias, while the opposite is true for clashing synaesthe- sias. Hence, investigating the way in which synaesthetic metaphors are interpreted, in both their compatible and clashing for- mats, should tell us whether cognitive bias rules as the cognitive constraints theory claims. In the interpretation–generation experi- ment 80 subjects were asked to interpret a series of synaesthetic metaphors, in either compatible or clashing form. The interpre- tations were dividing into matching and nonmatching responses. Matching responses were those in which the noun in the target slot was of a higher modality than the noun in the source slot. Thus, the compatible synaesthesia the aroma of caressing, in which the topic (target) noun “aroma” is of higher sensory modality (smell) than the modiﬁer (source) noun “caressing” (touch), produced the matching response, “the agreeable smell of the lover, who provides warmth,” in which target domain noun (smell) is of a higher modality than the source domain noun (touch). Nonmatching responses were those in which topic (target) term belonged to a lower sensory modality than the modiﬁer (source) term, as in the case of the synaesthe- sia the spiciness of shouting, which was taken to mean “a spicy taste that causes one to shout,” a clearly nonmatching response, in which the target term is of a lower modality (taste) than the source term (sound). Eighty- six percent of the interpretations proved to be matching responses, and only 14% nonmatching ones. These ﬁndings showed that, as predicted, there is a distinct ten- dency to reconﬁgure the target and source concepts in accordance with the cognitive bias when deciphering clashing synaesthe- sias – that is, the original target–source order is inverted in line with the directionality principle.\nMETAPHOR AND POETIC FIGURES 305 GENERAL DISCUSSION The main argument put forward in this chapter is that the use of various types of ﬁgurative expressions in poetry is, cross- linguistically, highly selective and system- atic and that this selectiveness is to a large extent constrained by cognitive principles. This argument has some bearings on at least three lines of research on the cognitive study of poetic ﬁgures. The ﬁrst one is used primarily in the areas of cognitive poetics (e.g., Tsur, 1992) and the empirical study of literature (e.g., van-Peer, 1986). By and large, these theories assume that poetic structures (with ﬁgura- tive structures a central case in this respect) interfere with cognitive principles to achieve aesthetic effects. The present view com- plements this line of research by suggest- ing that, in addition to interference with cognitive principles, ﬁgurative expression in poetry also conforms with cognitive prin- ciples. This may (at least partly) account for the communicability of those poetic expressions. A second line of research is the one asso- ciated with Lakoff’s paradigm of concep- tual metaphors and its elaborations, such as the cognitive theory of metaphor (e.g., Freeman, 1995; Lakoff & Turner, 1989) and blending theory (Hiraga, 1999; Turner & Fauconnier, 1995). The shared assumption of this group of theories is that ﬁgurative expressions appearing in poetic discourse, as well as entire poems, rely on and extend the basic “deep” conceptual metaphors that govern everyday ﬁgurative expressions. In this respect, the present approach shares the assumption that poetic ﬁgurative expres- sions conform to general cognitive princi- ples or constraints. However, the present account extends this line of research in sev- eral major respects. It broadens the scope of ﬁgurative types traditionally studied by focusing on less studied ﬁgures in this tra- dition (for an exception, see Yu, 2003), such as synaesthetic metaphors and zeugmas. Fur- thermore, it investigates in some detail var- ious linguistic forms that have been less studied, such as conjunctions and genitive constructions (in addition to noun–adjective and comparison constructions). The impor- tance of including a variety of linguistic forms, is that it allows us to investigate more convincingly the claim that ﬁguration is not merely a linguistic phenomenon but also a conceptual one. If this is indeed the case, then the effect of general cognitive mecha- nisms should apply to a large array of linguis- tic forms employed by ﬁgurative language. The present approach also has some bear- ing on a third line of research – the psy- cholinguistic study of ﬁgurative language (e.g., Chiappe et al., 2003; Glucksberg et al., 1997; Ortony et al., 1985). These researches have studied the various cognitive mecha- nisms at play during the processing of ﬁgures, notably metaphors and similes (as well as the differences between their use in comprehen- sion and production). The present chapter extended some of the conclusions reached by these researches (e.g., the asymmetries of similes and metaphors in general, as pointed out by Ortony et al., 1985, and Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990) in several respects. Typically, these researches studied the cognitive under- pinnings of nonpoetic (conventional or arti- ﬁcially constructed) ﬁgurative expressions; the present research has extended some of their generalizations (in particular, those rel- evant to asymmetries in similes) to the novel and creative use of ﬁgurative expressions composed by poets for artistic purposes. Fur- theremore, it has shown that these general- izations cut across not only different types of ﬁguration but also linguistic structure (i.e., comparison, conjunction, or genitive), lan- guage boundaries, genre boundaries (poetry and prose), historical periods, and experi- mental tasks. Of particular importance is the “inversion effect” ﬁnding for CLS expressions, which has not been studied very much in past psy- cholinguistic research on ﬁgurative language (but see Chiappe et al., 2003 and Glucksberg et al., 1997 who pointed out inversion effects in the comprehension of similes). To recapit- ulate, for each of the three ﬁgures we exam- ined an inversion effect of the CLS struc- tures was found, whereby subjects showed a tendency to change a CLS structure into a COS structure. Such inversions are not\n306 YESHAYAHU SHEN merely superﬁcial inversions of word order but rather a radical inversion of the meaning of the expression in question. Thus, a subject who interprets the CLS simile an anchor is like a friend as “a friend can be like an anchor if you have a close friend” shows a radically different understanding of the simile in ques- tion (and not only a difﬁculty in compre- hending it) from the meaning “suggested” by the linguistic form: Under this reading, the expression says something about a friend (that he resembles an anchor), rather than something about an anchor (as the linguis- tic form of the original simile “suggests”). This may suggest that the cognitive pref- erence for mapping more accessible onto less accessible domains not only determines which structures are considered more nat- ural or are easier to comprehend but that under certain conditions it may determine the very meaning of a metaphorical expres- sion by determining which is the target con- cept (that is, what the expression is about) and which is the source (that is, what is being said, metaphorically, about the tar- get). Traditionally, researchers in the ﬁeld have tacitly assumed that a linguistic con- vention determines the target and source distinction for any metaphorical expression. Thus, it has been tacitly assumed that there is a linguistic convention that assigns the target slot to the grammatical subject of a comparison structure (that is, “A” in the “A is like B” structure), the head noun of an adjective–noun construction (e.g., “silence” in “a sweet silence”), or the head noun in a genitive (noun–noun) construction (e.g., “sunset” in “sunset of blood”). The inversion effect ﬁnding may suggest that the cogni- tive bias toward considering more accessible concepts as sources and less accessible ones as targets may override the relevant default convention when the two clash (that is, if the latter assigns an accessible concept the target slot and less accessible one the source slot). This far-reaching effect of the concep- tual bias requires further research into the ﬁne-grained details of the way the linguistic default conventions and the conceptual or cognitive principles interact to produce the meaning of metaphorical expressions.

Barnden Introduction Why is Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) concerned with metaphor, and what special contribu- tions can AI offer to metaphor research? This chapter will indicate why AI needs to study metaphor and will outline what AI has been contributing to the illumination of metaphor, whether it is processed by arte- facts or by the human mind. Speciﬁc contributions of AI research on metaphor that one can already point to, and that will be addressed to varying extents in this chapter, include the following: cre- ation of detailed mechanisms for reason- ing within the terms of the source-domain in a metaphor, in order expand the rel- evance of known source-target mappings; increased emphasis on uncertainty and grad- edness in metaphorical reasoning; a richer view of overriding (source-over-target as well as target-over-source); mechanisms for exploiting context; important steps towards integration with metonymy interpretation; some emphasis on disanalogy and a limi- tation of the role of parallelism between source and target; the usefulness of reversed transfers (transfers from source domain to target domain); the importance of non- assertional metaphor; increased doubt about whether the notion of a “domain” is actually important and well-founded; and clariﬁca- tion of ways in which literal meaning can be involved in metaphor interpretation. The plan of the chapter is as follows. The next section will make some observations about AI, explain why metaphor is impor- tant to applications-oriented aspects of AI, and indicate why, in general terms, AI can make distinctive contributions to the study of cognition as a whole, metaphor included. Then a new section will sketch ﬁve differ- ent, relatively recent AI research works on metaphor. This is to set the scene for the following section, which will discuss speciﬁc contributions of AI to metaphor research. The issues will be summarized in a brief concluding section. The chapter does not attempt to survey AI research on metaphor completely or to provide a history of this work, despite the fact that AI has long had an interest in metaphor (cf. e.g. Car- bonell, 1980, 1982; Norvig, 1989; Russell, 1976, 1985; Way, 1991; Weber, 1989; Weiner, 311\n312 JOHN A. BARNDEN 1984; Wilks, 1978), and also simile (e.g. Win- ston, 1979) and analogy (see Hall, 1989, for a review). Readers interested in AI work not covered here may also wish to look at Mar- tin’s (1996) and Russell’s (1986) reviews and the extensive review in Fass (1997, chap. 11). Also, we omit description of work on theo- retical approaches to metaphor that while being interesting and important in them- selves do not address processing issues to any large extent, such as the approaches of Asher and Lascarides (1995), Hintikka and Sandu (1990), Indurkhya (1991, 1992), van Genabith (2001), and Vogel (2001). For rea- sons of space we omit description of compu- tational study of metaphor in corpora (e.g. Mason, 2004) despite some close connec- tions to AI. The chapter makes some men- tion of metonymy because of the close con- nection of metaphor and metonymy and because, as we will see, some major AI work on metaphor also addresses metonymy. Artiﬁcial Intelligence AI has at least three separate, though inter- related, aims: An “engineering” aim: To engineer, or pro- vide computational principles and meth- ods for engineering, useful artefacts that are arguably intelligent, without necessarily having any mechanistic similarity to human or animal minds/brains. The usefulness may be in an industrial domain or an everyday, practical domain, but may also be in other domains such as art or mathematical theo- rem proving. A “psychological” aim: To devise compu- tational principles, computationally detailed theories, or running computational systems that provide a basis for possible testable accounts of cognition in human or animal minds/brains. A “general/philosophical” aim: To devise computational principles, computationally detailed theories, or running computational systems that serve as or suggest possible accounts of cognition in general, whether it be in human-made artefacts, in natu- rally occurring organisms, or in cognizing organisms yet to be discovered, or that illu- minate philosophical issues such as the nature of mind, thought, intelligence, conscious- ness, perception, language, representation, learning, rationality, society, and so on . . . not forgetting computation itself. On top of this multiplicity of aims, the word “intelligence” is usually taken very broadly in the ﬁeld, to cover not only pure rational thought but also almost anything that could come under the heading of “cog- nition,” “perception,” “language use,” “emo- tion” and so forth. Thus, the name “artiﬁcial intelligence” has always been something of a nom de plume, with both parts of the name each hinting at only one aspect of the nature of the actual endeavour. The three aims are often inextricably combined in a given piece of research. For one thing, an individual researcher may have more than one of the aims. But also, of course, developments in pursuit of any one of the aims could happen to inspire advances towards one of the others, and endeavours towards any one of the aims can proactively look for inspiration from research towards the others. Before going on, it is useful to explain why metaphor is important for the Engi- neering aim of AI. Many intelligent artefacts that need to communicate well with people using human language will need to be able to cope with metaphor. Metaphor is prevalent in human linguistic discourse, even when it is just mundane conversation. Slightly more indirectly, some intelligent artefacts need to understand linguistic communica- tion between people, for instance for the purpose of understanding newspaper articles written by people for other people. Indeed, metaphor is becoming an increasingly loom- ing obstacle for Engineering AI, as attempts are made to bring better automated human- language processing into commercial prod- ucts, to develop ever more advanced com- puter interfaces and virtual reality systems, to develop automated understanding and production of emotional expression given that this is often conveyed explicitly or implicitly by metaphor (Delﬁno & Manea, 2005; Emanatian, 1995; Fainsilber & Ortony,\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 313 1987; Fussell & Moss, 1998; K¨ovecses, 2000; Thomas, 1969; Yu, 1995), and also of ges- ture and sign language given that these forms of communication have strong metaphorical aspects (McNeill, 1992; P. P. Wilcox, 2004; S. Wilcox, 2004; Woll, 1985). To return to the set of aims overall: their multiplicity, and their nature taken individ- ually, cause problems in the evaluation of developments in AI. Engineering develop- ments can clearly be evaluated on the basis of actual usefulness or promise of such, but the nature of evaluation is more difﬁcult for the other aims. Evaluation can be on criteria such as coherence, simplicity, computational efﬁciency and so forth, and on whether the development in question does in principle achieve the intended cognitive ends, but beyond that the evaluation must be in the indirect, long-term, and subjective sense of the extent to which the development con- tributes eventually to other ﬁelds such as Philosophy or Psychology, or is at least per- ceived as embodying interesting and inspir- ing ideas for these ﬁelds. Since Psychology is currently the locus of intensive research on metaphor, it is worth stressing that within the Psychological aim there is not neces- sarily any goal to produce an immediately testable psychological theory. Rather, the aim is creatively to provide computationally well-founded and well-designed bases from which psychologists or others could proceed to develop testable theories. I hope that in the descriptions of the three aims above the reader will have observed the hedging about whether the AI develop- ments are actually “implemented” (that is, realized in the form of computer software or hardware). Hence the mention of compu- tational principles, methods, and computation- ally detailed theories, not just working com- putational systems. A product of AI research does not have to be a working computer pro- gram or piece of computer hardware. Rather, it can be a system description or formal logi- cal account that is detailed and speciﬁc to the extent that software or hardware could read- ily if laboriously be developed. It can also be a description of new types of representation, inferencing or other processing that could form part of an AI system (implemented or otherwise). Such products of AI may be left with- out implementation not through neglect but rather because they can be assessed, to a use- ful degree, in terms of their coherence, effec- tiveness, efﬁciency, interest, distinctiveness, and so on without being implemented. Also, the act of creating the product can uncover problems and issues that would be unlikely to arise in less detailed and speciﬁc theoriz- ing. Much of the point of creating even a working AI system is not so much to use it in practice but to serve just such ends as uncov- ering problems and gaps, studying the rela- tionship to other proposed systems, and so on. In short, much of the point of develop- ing a detailed computational account, imple- mented or not, is aid in the development of principles, methods, and theories in more detail and with greater security than would otherwise be likely. These explanations about AI could be paralleled to some extent by observations about Computer Science in general. Much research in Computer Science is not directly about producing working software or hard- ware. For example, much of the ﬁeld is mathematical theory directed at the nature of computation, the complexity of algo- rithms, the abstract meaning of computer programs, and the well-founded design of programming languages and computer systems. Given that the Psychological and Gen- eral/Philosophical aims of AI impinge on the concerns of other disciplines, the ques- tion arises as to whether AI research has anything special to offer to such disciplines over and above what they can do by them- selves. There are several reasons for a pos- itive answer. First, AI has special exper- tise in a wide variety of different forms of computation, in putting them on a proper, well-thought-out foundation and, impor- tantly, in ﬁnding complicated combinations of them or compromises between them. The hope is that a strong Computer Science background or context enables many AI researchers to come up with suggestions that are, in computational ways, more advanced,\n314 JOHN A. BARNDEN richer, more subtle, more complex, more formally coherent, and/or more extensively and securely developed than is generally pos- sible in other disciplines, with their own demands and pressures concerning other matters. Pressure towards developing effective compromises and combinations comes from the applications focus within the Engineer- ing aim, and from the focus in all three aims of the production of working artefacts or at least detailed computational schemes and methods. These foci can also provide a useful “sanity check,” helping for exam- ple to uncover unwelcome but difﬁcult- to-discern interactions between parts of a theory, to avoid vagueness in descriptions of representations and processes, to avoid over- simpliﬁcation, and to ensure greater cover- age of underlying technical issues than in other ﬁelds. AI Research on Metaphor: An Illustrative Review of Recent Work In outlining the nature of AI above we looked at some general reasons why it is in a position to make helpful contributions to the study of cognition, or, at least, why it is in a better position to make certain types of advance than other disciplines are. As for speciﬁc metaphor research issues on which AI is in a relatively good position to be helpful, we will examine some of them after reviewing, in this section, a hand- ful of particular metaphor research works within AI. Hobbs Important work on metaphor in AI was done by Hobbs (1990, 1992). The ideas do not seem to have met with a substantial imple- mentation effort, but Hobbs has devised a detailed computational account from which implementations could be developed rea- sonably readily as an extension to the imple- mented TACITUS system (Hobbs et al., 1993). We can divide the work into the fol- lowing three strands: 1. Unmodiﬁed-property transfer: When X is metaphorically described as Y, this method can attribute to X a property P of Y, provided P also makes sense for X without modiﬁcation. A simple exam- ple is interpreting “John is an elephant” to mean that John is clumsy, given that clumsiness is (let us assume) a property of elephants, and given that it can also be applied to people. 2. Transfer by known mappings within inference: This method uses known mappings between aspects of the source domain and aspects of the tar- get domain. Importantly, unmapped aspects of the source domain can be used in a metaphor by virtue of their source-domain inferential connections to the source-domain elements that are mapped by known mappings. Also, the mappings are themselves cast as infer- ence rules (see below). Thus, uses of mappings are just inference steps along with any other. 3. Mapping discovery by analogy: hypothe- sizing mappings between complex situ- ations in source and target from scratch, by means of structural matching, in order to handle metaphor that is novel to the understander. All three strands are placed (in Hobbs, 1992) within a general inferential framework for natural language understanding, which, in particular, also handles metonymy. This framework has abduction as its guiding prin- ciple and its central means of inference. In essence, linguistic expressions are regarded as outward signs of underlying situations that are conveyed by the expressions, and the understander’s task is to move abduc- tively from the outward signs to the under- lying situations. A crucial aspect of Hobbs’s overall abductive approach is that it is, thereby, an approach founded on uncertain inference. In the ﬁrst strand, Unmodiﬁed-Property Usage, Hobbs has an appealing, context- driven view of how the properties are selected in a given case. As he says, “John is an elephant” cannot be precisely interpreted\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 315 outside of context (Hobbs, 1990, 59). But he claims that, given suitable context, coher- ence considerations can lead to a precise interpretation. Thus, Hobbs asserts that “Mary is graceful, but John is an elephant” suggests the interpretation that John has a property that contrasts with gracefulness. If it is known that elephants are clumsy, and this is the only elephant property that con- trasts with gracefulness, then the clumsi- ness interpretation is secured. This context- driven approach to the choice of properties to transfer contrasts with approaches that use selection principles relying on, for exam- ple, context-insensitive notions of salience of properties (as in Ortony, 1979). In the third strand – mapping discov- ery by analogy – Hobbs does not dif- fer much in broad outline from other researchers (e.g. Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989; Gentner, 1983) who propose analogical structure-matching as the way to deal with (some) metaphor. Arguably the second strand, transfer by known mappings within inference, is the most interesting of the three. Hobbs provides as a prime exam- ple the use of spatial metaphor in Computer Science. One talks of a variable in a com- puter program as being “at”, a number, say 100, as a way of saying that the variable’s value is 100. Hobbs proposes therefore that a communicating agent that is familiar with this way of talking (or thinking) could have an inferential rule that can be glossed in English as IF in some situation a variable’s value is V THEN in that situation the variable is [spatially-]at V. Thus, this rule embodies a known mapping link between the source domain of space and the target domain of computer-science enti- ties. The rule has the same status as any other inferential rule, and can be used at any con- venient point during an overall process of inference-based understanding. It may look strange that the rule has the IF/THEN going from target to source rather than source to target. This is because rules are used abduc- tively in Hobbs’s approach: the variable’s being spatially-at V leads to the abductive hypothesis that the variable’s value is V. The displayed rule acquires an indeﬁnite amount of extra power in the following way. One talks of a variable “going” from say 100 to 200, as a way of stating a value change; of a variable being “between” two numbers; of a variable “keeping one step behind” another; and so forth: productively using an indeﬁ- nite large part of the domain of space. Hobbs argues that such talk can be handled with- out the need to have separate mappings for “go,” “between,” and so on: rather, it suf- ﬁces to use inferential connections within the source domain such as one between going and being-spatially-at and, thereby to be able to connect going to the mapping displayed above from being-spatially-at to having-as- value. Thus, a variable’s “going” from 100 to 200 is ultimately interpreted as a change from a situation of having value 100 to a sit- uation of having value 200. Finally, Hobbs (1990) regards metaphor as crossing over between different domains, but fully accepts that domains have fuzzy boundaries and that the notion of domain is difﬁcult. He therefore propounds that the exact scope of the notion of metaphor is theory-relative, in depending on deci- sions about what domains exist: there is no objective, theory-free fact of the mat- ter about the boundaries of metaphor. In any case, Hobbs’s actual computational approach does not impose or operationally rely upon any domain divisions at all. There- fore, mapping rules could in principle link concepts that, intuitively, are arbitrarily close. Martin An implemented computer program, called MIDAS, for metaphor interpretation and generation was produced by James Mar- tin (1990, 2000). The acronym MIDAS stands for Metaphor Interpretation, Deno- tation, and Acquisition System. MIDAS was designed in part as a supplement to the Unix Consultant system, a computer program for automatically answering users’ questions about the Unix operating system.\n316 JOHN A. BARNDEN MIDAS incorporates knowledge of a set of a roughly Lakovian conceptual meta- phors. The speciﬁc set included can be changed and is not itself the interesting side of the system. We will assume here, for expo- sitional purposes, that MIDAS knows the conceptual metaphor USING A COMPUTER PROCESS IS BEING PHYSICALLY INSIDE A REGION. The system’s knowledge base con- sists of a network of concepts. Among the concepts are the concept of using a com- puter process and the concept of being inside a region. These two concepts are linked by a “metaphor map.” The metaphor map will be notated here in the following way, although the real structure is much more complex: being-inside-a-region ↔using-a-computer- process Also, the two concepts have roles (or “slots”) within them. Correspondingly there are two additional metaphor maps, this time crossing between roles: the-enclosing-region ↔the-used-process the-thing-enclosed ↔the-process-user. As a result of knowing the conceptual metaphor, the system can easily understand a statement such as “I am in Emacs” to mean that the speaker is using Emacs, given that the word “in” accesses the being-inside- a-region concept. The literal interpretation that the speaker is physically in Emacs is rejected, because Emacs is not repre- sented in the system as being a region. By contrast, the metaphorical interpretation is accepted because Emacs is represented as being a computer process. Importantly, though, the literal interpretation does not need to be rejected before the metaphorical one is accepted. The system tries to apply the possibly relevant conceptual metaphors it knows, irrespective of whether the literal interpretation is acceptable. MIDAS can also interpret metaphorical utterances that do not immediately ﬁt its known mappings. The process of handling such utterances is handled by the MES (Metaphor Extension System) component of MIDAS. It uses two different techni- ques: similarity-extension and core-extension. Suppose the system knows that conversa- tions are similar to computer processes, in the sense that they are both special cases of a more general concept of a process. Then the system can interpret the sentence I am in a conversation by using its known conceptual metaphor USING A COMPUTER PROCESS IS BEING PHYSICALLY INSIDE A REGION. Because of the known similarity between COMPUTER PROCESSES and CON- VERSATIONS, the system has a mechanism for coming up with the new conceptual metaphor BEING ENGAGED IN A CONVER- SATION IS BEING PHYSICALLY INSIDE A REGION. This similarity-extension method is pow- erful, but core-extension is yet more so. The system can interpret the sentence “How do I get into Emacs?” just on the basis of knowing the conceptual metaphor USING A COMPUTER PROCESS IS BEING PHYSICALLY INSIDE A REGION and knowing some simple things about regions. The system is unable to ﬁnd an acceptable interpretation using that conceptual metaphor directly. How- ever, through knowing about a result rela- tionship between the concept of moving-into (accessed by the phrase “get into”) to the concept of being physically-in, and knowing that a usage of a process by a user is a result of the user invoking that process, the system can conjecture that the speaker is asking, in effect, “How do I invoke Emacs?” The sys- tem will create a new conceptual metaphor INVOKING A COMPUTER PROCESS IS PHYS- ICALLY MOVING INTO A REGION. The term “core-extension” is used because the con- cepts involved, such as moving-into and being-physically-in, must be “core-related.” This somewhat complex notion covers only rather direct relationships such as the result relationship involved above. Martin seeks to avoid having a literal- ﬁrst account in an effort to obey the “total time constraint” (Gerrig, 1989) that conventional metaphors should take no longer to process than superﬁcially simi- lar literal language. MIDAS certainly avoids being literal-ﬁrst in the sense that it avoids the need to reject literal inter- pretations before considering metaphorical\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 317 ones. However, it does need to construct literal interpretations before considering metaphorical ones. As Fass (1997, 316) points out, MIDAS is to be applauded for being able to pre- fer a metaphorical reading of “McEnroe killed Connors” (i.e., defeated him) to a literal reading, even though the latter is itself semantically acceptable. It turns out that the scoring mechanisms in the sys- tem, which knows that McEnroe and Con- nors are sportsmen, cause it to regard a SPORTIVE DEFEATING AS KILLING interpre- tation as more tightly ﬁtting the sentence than a literal interpretation does, because sports-defeat requires its role-ﬁllers to be competitors whereas killing has a much less speciﬁc requirement. Martin does not make any use of the notion of a domain in his account of MIDAS, and there are no explicit domain divisions in MIDAS. Metaphor maps can in princi- ple join arbitrarily close concepts, and what metaphor amounts to for the system is there- fore entirely dependent on what maps hap- pen to be included and how existing concep- tual metaphors can be extended. Fass A second major implemented AI system for metaphor processing is that of Dan Fass (1997), indirectly related to the research of Wilks (1978). Fass’s system is called meta5 (punningly, a step beyond metaphor). The system proceeds entirely by discovering analogies between source and target struc- tures from scratch, with the process being guided by a relevance criterion explained below. It should be mentioned at once that the analogies discovered are of a very sim- ple sort. However, the processing needed to discover them can be complex and subtle. Also, the system is unusual in measuring the degree of disanalogy between source and tar- get structures, and using this measure in rat- ing the aptness of the metaphor. One standard-bearing example of meta5’s processing is provided by (4) My car drinks gasoline taken from Wilks (1978). The system can interpret this as meaning “My car uses gaso- line” essentially by ﬁnding an analogical match between the prior knowledge the sys- tem has that animals drink drinkable stuff and the prior knowledge that cars in general use gasoline. As a consequence, in construct- ing the internal meaning representation of the sentence, a use word-sense is employed as the right sense for the verb “drink” in the sentence. In somewhat more detail, we can explain the process as follows, assuming the sys- tem only has one lexical sense for the verb “drink,” namely the normal sense of an ani- mal imbibing a liquid. We notate this sense here as drink. That the agent must be an animal and the patient must be a liquid is encoded as “preferences” (or “selection restrictions”) in the permanent representa- tion of the lexical sense in the system. The system ﬁnds, though, that the actual agent according to the sentence, the car, is not an animal. At some point the system will therefore look for a possible metaphorical way of interpreting the car-drink relation- ship in the sentence. It does this by seeing whether its knowledge about animals con- tains an item that is relevant to the sen- tence. The approach here is simple: from the sentence it takes only the drink word-sense, notes this sense’s preference for an animal agent, and sees whether in the knowledge about animals there is information that they take part in a relationship that is either drink- ing or a word-sense-wise ancestor of drink- ing. Indeed, the system ﬁnds the knowledge item that animals drink drinkable-stuff. No other knowledge item for animal is relevant. The system then looks for knowledge items within its prior knowledge of cars that match that animal knowledge item. It ﬁnds that the following matching item: cars use gasoline. It determines that there is a match because the use word sense and the drink word-sense are “sisters”: they both have the same immediate parent sense, namely expend. Equally, the senses drinkable-stuff and gasoline are sisters, with liquid as parent. Such a pair of sister relationships between two knowledge items is necessary for them\n318 JOHN A. BARNDEN to match. The system has now found a metaphorical relationship between “car” and “drinks” in the sentence, and can build a sen- tence meaning representation tantamount to “My car uses gasoline.” The system also looks at its non-relevant knowledge items about animal and car, in the above sense of relevance, and measures both how many other matching knowledge items there are and how many knowledge items for each of those two word-senses are not matched by a knowledge item for the other. The extra matches contribute to the strength of the metaphor, but the dif- ference counts are inspired by the claim of Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) that the greater the conceptual distance between source and target the more apt the metaphor. The counts can be used to choose between competing metaphorical interpretations, in other examples. A point on which meta5 can be criti- cized, and is indeed criticized by Fass him- self (1997, sect. 10.3.1.1), is that there is no coordination between a metaphorical rela- tion found between the agent and verb (“car” and “drink”) and a metaphorical or other relation found between verb and patient (“drink” and “gasoline”). Thus, the system does not look holistically at the sentence in determining the presence of analogies. This creates a problem with a sentence such as “My car drinks coffee,” which Fass wishes his system to regard as anomalous and not metaphorical, and therefore not to settle on a metaphorical relation between the car and the drinking. Fass suggests a detailed solution to this problem, not discussed here. The incremental semantic construction approach in the (unﬁxed) system is in itself interesting because it means that the sys- tem does not even construct a literal inter- pretation of the whole sentence before inves- tigating metaphoricity, let alone reject a literal interpretation. But it is important to note that in the investigation by the system of a part of the sentence, such as “my car” together with “drinks,” the system does adopt a fully literal-ﬁrst approach: a metaphorical relation is only sought if an acceptable literal interpretation cannot be found for that part. Although it can be argued that this is a wrong approach even for sentence-parts, it does the service of show- ing us that the question of processing order in metaphorical sentence interpretation is much more complex than that of how lit- eral and metaphorical interpretations of the whole sentence are ordered. The system includes a complex numer- ical scoring mechanism to choose between competing interpretations of sentence parts as it goes along. This is largely based on lengths of paths in the semantic network. Fass (1997, sect. 10.2.2) has implemented a system extension in which the match scor- ing aspects of the system are enriched. The enrichment adds a diagnostic-salience mea- sure on knowledge items that is dependent on how much inheritance was involved in ﬁnding them: for example, that a car has a deﬁnite physical boundary is inherited from further away in the semantic network than that a car has wheels, and is therefore less salient. Differences of salience could then be used to reﬁne the comparative evaluation of discovered analogies. On the other hand, there are major problems with the simplistic requirement that metaphorical analogies require sister relationships between cell components. For instance, it appears that the metaphorical interpretation above could not be found if, instead of gasoline being a direct descen- dant of liquid, there were a liquid-fuel sense interposed. However, given that the system already includes complex distance- based scoring, it would be straightforward to adjust the system to allow generalized cousin relationships rather than sister relationships, and to downplay or discount relationships that involved excessively long paths. Finally, meta5 is interesting in being a fully implemented system that performs complex metonymic understanding as well as metaphorical understanding. It has knowl- edge of some conventional metonymic rela- tionships such as ARTIST FOR ART PRODUCT and can therefore interpret sentences such as “John reads Shakespeare.” Indeed, the sys- tem can handle arbitrarily long chains of metonymy. A limitation of the system is that\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 319 metonymic interpretation is tried strictly before metaphorical, restricting the possibil- ities of interaction. The system can neverthe- less obtain some forms of mixed metaphor- ical/metonymic interpretation. There is no notion of domain in the design of the system, and word-senses are not sorted by domain. Indeed, as the sister relation- ship (above) is the core of analogy in meta5, metaphorical relationships can be between structures that are conceptually arbitrarily close up to sisterhood. Gasoline could have kerosene as a sister. Finally, Iverson and Helmreich (1992) implemented a system, Metallel, that can be viewed as a substantially modiﬁed version of meta5, correcting some of its deﬁcien- cies. The system is ably summarized by Fass (1997, sect 10.1). Metallel views metonymy and metaphor as being on a par, rather than metonymy having precedence as in meta5. Once Metallel has found some potential available metonymic and metaphorical inter- pretations by a somewhat loose form of path search, it selects between them on the basis of a “grounding” process, which incorpo- rates a type of analogical matching much like meta5’s but that takes into account the whole sentence, not just parts of it in succes- sion as meta5 does. Barnden: ATT-Meta, Map-Transcendence and Pretence The present author has implemented an approach, called ATT-Meta, for performing a type of reasoning that is arguably often necessary for metaphor interpretation. The approach is described in Barnden (1998, 2001a), Barnden, Glasbey, Lee, and Walling- ton (2004), Barnden, Helmreich, Iverson, and Stein (1994), Barnden and Lee (1999, 2001), and Lee and Barnden (2001a). The implemented ATT-Meta program is only a reasoning system and does not take linguis- tic strings as input, but, rather, logical forms assumed to be derivable from sentences by initial processing. For now the reader can take these logical forms to encode the lit- eral meanings of the sentences, but we will reﬁne this point below. The metaphorical utterances of main interest in the ATT-Meta project are those that are conceptually related to known conceptual metaphors but that transcend them by involving source-domain elements not directly handled by the mappings in those metaphors. In ATT-Meta parlance these utterances are map-transcending. For instance, going back to the Hobbs examples, the sentence “N leaps from 1 to 100” is map- transcending for an understander if he/she/it only knows a physically-leap lexical sense for the verb “leap” but does not know a map- ping for that sense into the target domain of variables and values, even though he/she/it does know a mapping from, say, spatially- at to have-as-value. Similarly, if an under- stander knows a metaphorical mapping from physically-in to using-a-process (see Martin case) but has no mapping for physically-enter, then the sentence “How do I enter Emacs?” is map-transcending. Clearly, map-transcendence is a fuzzy concept that is relative to particular understanders and particular conceptual metaphors the understander knows, and to our intuitive perceptions as to what is con- ceptually related to what (e.g. physically- leaping to being-spatially-at). Nevertheless, it is a useful intuitive characterization of a phenomenon that lies along a broad sec- tor of the spectrum between conventional metaphor on the one hand and, on the other hand, entirely novel metaphor where no relevant mapping is known at all. Map- transcendence is strongly related to the phe- nomenon of unused parts of the source domain as discussed in Lakoff & Johnson (1980). Very broadly speaking, ATT-Meta’s app- roach is similar to Hobbs’s second strand (Transfer by Known Mappings within Inference): ATT-Meta is based on rules encapsulating known metaphorical corre- spondences such as between physically-at and has-as-value, and on an integrated infer- ential framework which, in particular, allows arbitrarily rich source-domain reasoning to connect sentence components to source- domain concepts that can be mapped by known mappings. So, both systems can infer\n320 JOHN A. BARNDEN that a variable N has value 100 from any sen- tence couched in spatial terms that implies that N is physically-at 100, as long as the sys- tems have the necessary knowledge about physical space to infer that N is physically-at 100 from the sentence. The inference can be arbitrarily indirect and complex in principle. To make the point, a vivid example would be a sentence such as “N started a circuitous route towards 100 but didn’t complete the journey until after M fell to 0.” This implies, among other things, that N (at some point) had value 100. However, there is a fundamental differ- ence of approach, as well as many tech- nical differences of representation and rea- soning, between ATT-Meta and Hobbs’s scheme. The difference is that ATT-Meta avoids placing internal propositions such as N is physically-at 100, which are not state- ments about reality, on a par with statements such as N has value 100, which are. Hobbs’s approach does maintain them on a par: there is nothing in his internal representation to say that the former proposition is merely a metaphorical pretence or ﬁction. Instead, ATT-Meta creates a special com- putational “mental space” in which such propositions and inferences arising from them are kept aside from propositions and reasoning about reality. We call this space a metaphorical pretence cocoon. Thus, the internal proposition N physically-leaps from 1 to 100 arising directly from the sentence “N leaps from 1 to 100” is placed in the cocoon, and the inference result that (say) N is spatially-at 100 afterwards, together with the inference chain itself, lies within the cocoon. A metaphorical mapping rule that takes spatially-at to has-as-value can then give the result that, in reality, N has value 100 afterwards. By clearly marking some propositions as being pretences, the use of a cocoon ensures that the system is not misled by the propo- sitions directly derived from metaphori- cal utterances, that is, propositions like N physically-leaps from 1 to 100. Notice that in the case of “McEnroe killed Connors,” the understander needs to be clear that the directly derived proposition McEnroe biologically killed Connors is not a statement about reality. But, in addition, if the under- stander knows that McEnroe deﬁnitely did not biologically kill Connors in reality, we do not want to let that information defeat the pretend information that McEnroe did biologically kill Connors. Thus, pretence cocoons prevent pretences from infecting reality but equally protect the integrity of pretences. The use of cocoons has another bene- ﬁt. Lee and Barnden (2001a) studied mixed metaphor of various types, and showed how ATT-Meta deals with them. The main dis- tinction studied was between serial mix- ing (commonly called chaining), where A is viewed as B and B is viewed as C, and parallel mixing, where A is used simultaneously as B and as C (see also Wilks, Barnden, & Wang, 1991). Serial mixing is viewed as having the B material in a cocoon that is directly embed- ded in the reality space, whereas the C mate- rial as in a cocoon embedded within the B cocoon. Thus, there is a pretence within a pretence. In parallel mixing, on the other hand, the B and C material is either com- bined in a single cocoon or is in two separate cocoons both directly embedded within the reality space. Thus, we have two pretences either side by side or blended with each other. There are unresolved issues about how to decide between these two possibilities, but in any case different dispositions of pre- tence cocoons allow important differences between types of mixing of metaphor to be reﬂected in the processing. We have indicated that what is initially inserted in the pretence cocoon in the case of “N leaps from 1 to 100” is the propo- sition N physically-leaps from 1 to 100, and what is inserted in the case of “McEnroe killed Connors” is McEnroe biologically killed Connors. This reﬂects a general assumption in the ATT-Meta approach that what is inserted in the cocoon is a “direct” mean- ing of the metaphorical sentence (or of some metaphorical sentence-component such as a clause). A direct meaning is a logical form derived compositionally from the “direct” senses of lexical units in sentences. A direct sense is just any sense listed for the lexical\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 321 unit in the understander’s lexicon, so that it is directly accessible from the lexical unit. In particular, we have been assuming that the verbs “leap” and “kill” have as direct senses the concepts of physically leap and biologi- cally kill respectively. Clearly, a given lexical unit could actu- ally have more than one direct sense, and indeed some of the direct senses could be metaphorical or special in some other way. We simply embrace such possibilities, say- ing that if, for instance, “leap” had some- thing like change-value as a direct sense, then “N leaps from 1 to 100” could be under- stood without use of the inferential pre- tence mechanism outlined above, although in principle the mechanism could still be redundantly used as well. Equally, a direct sense may be ﬁgurative in some way but still lead to the construction of a proposi- tion in the pretence cocoon. For instance, suppose the word “star” has astronomical-star and prominent-movie-actor as its only direct senses, and that we regard the latter as a ﬁg- urative sense. Then “Mike is a star of the department” could be understood via the pretence mechanism using Mike is a promi- nent movie actor in the department in the cocoon. (Another option could be to use the astronomical-star sense.) Thus, in the ATT-Meta approach, the pretence mechanism is potentially use- ful if direct meanings of sentences lead by within-pretence reasoning to within- pretence propositions that can be mapped by known mapping rules. It is irrelevant whether a direct meaning is dubbed as “lit- eral” or not. We may or may not wish to regard physically leap as a literal sense of “leap” and prominent-movie-actor as a lit- eral sense of “star”, but such terminological decisions have no bearing in themselves on whether the pretence mechanism could be fruitful. Another fundamental reason for not rely- ing on a notion of literal meaning arises from serial mixing (A as B as C). In such a case, some of the phrasing in the utterance refers to the C domain, and this can cause material to arise in the B domain by C-to-B transfer. Therefore, B-to-A transfers may be working on metaphorical material derived by trans- fer from C. For this reason alone, it is mis- guided to think of metaphorical mapping as a matter of transforming literal meanings. The consequences of this point have hardly been explored in metaphor research. Insofar as direct meanings of sentences can often be regarded as literal meanings, ATT-Meta is in the class of systems that rely on constructing a literal meaning ﬁrst (not necessarily from a whole sentence, but per- haps from a component such as a prepo- sitional phrase or clause). Still, there is no reliance on rejecting that literal meaning before proceeding to metaphorical process- ing. Before continuing this description of ATT-Meta we also must explain that its reasoning is entirely query-directed. Query- directed reasoning – more usually called goal-directed reasoning – is a powerful tech- nique much used in AI (see e.g. Russell & Norvig, 2002). In this form of reasoning, the process of reasoning starts with a query – an externally supplied or internally arising question as to whether something holds. Queries are compared to known proposi- tions and/or used to generate further queries by some means. In a rule-based system such as ATT-Meta, queries are compared to the result parts of rules, and then new queries arise from the condition parts. For example, in the case of a rule that says if someone is a student then he or she is presumably poor, a query as to whether John is poor would give rise to a subquery as to whether John is a student. The system’s metaphor-based reasoning is thoroughly integrated into a general- purpose rule-based framework for uncer- tain reasoning using qualitative uncertainty measures. ATT-Meta’s reasoning both in source-domain terms and in target-domain terms is generally uncertain. Rules and propositions are annotated with qualitative certainty levels. There is a heuristic conﬂict- resolution mechanism that attempts to adju- dicate between conﬂicting lines of reasoning, by considering their relative speciﬁcity. We are now ready to look in more detail at an example. Consider:\n322 JOHN A. BARNDEN In the far reaches of her mind, Anne believed that Kyle was having an affair. This is slightly adapted from a real-discourse example (Gross, 1994). We assume ATT- Meta is given knowledge of conceptual metaphors MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE and IDEAS AS PHYSICAL OBJECTS. We also assume that “far reaches” only has a spa- tial sense for the system and that the notion is not mapped to the mental domain by any conceptual metaphor known to the sys- tem. The most important mapping known to ATT-Meta is the following, and is part of ATT-Meta’s knowledge of IDEAS AS PHYSI- CAL OBJECTS: degree of (in)ability of an agent’s conscious self to operate physically on an idea that is a physical object, in the pretence cocoon, corresponds to degree of (in)ability of the agent to operate in a conscious mental way on the idea, in the reality space. A given metaphorical mapping link such as this is implicit in a set of transfer rules that we will not detail here. In the example as we run it using ATT-Meta, the system is given an initial target-domain query (IQ) that is, roughly speaking, of the form To what exact degree is Anne able to consciously operate mentally on the idea that Kyle had an affair? In Barnden and Lee (2001) we justify this as a reasonable query that could arise out of the surround- ing context. The query is reverse-transferred from target terms to source terms via the above mapping to become a query of form To what degree is Anne’s conscious self able to operate physically on the idea? ATT-Meta can then reason that that degree of physical operability is very low, using the source-domain informa- tion gleaned from the mention of “far reaches” in the utterance and from common- sense knowledge about physical spaces and objects. Once this very low degree is estab- lished in the source domain, it is forward- transferred via the mapping to give a very low degree of conscious mental operabil- ity as the answer to the initial query (IQ). The program’s reasoning for this example is treated in more detail in Barnden and Lee (2001). A variety of other examples are also computationally treated in that report and Barnden (2001c), Barnden et al. (2002), and Lee and Barnden (2001b). We must note a largely unimple- mented aspect of the ATT-Meta approach: “view-neutral mapping adjuncts” (VNMAs) (Barnden & Lee, 2001; Barnden et al., 2003). With partial inspiration from Carbonell’s (1982) AI work on metaphor, we view cer- tain aspects of source domain information such as attitudes, value judgments, beliefs, functions, rates, gradedness, uncertainty, and event structure to carry over to the target domain by default (the results can be over- ridden). For instance: r We assume that the ordering of events and their qualitative rates and durations carry over by default, whatever the nature of the particular metaphorical mapping being used, thus avoiding the need for individual mapping rules to deal with them. r If an agent A in the pretence has an atti- tude X (mental or emotional) to a propo- sition P, and A and P correspond, respec- tively, to an agent B and a proposition Q in reality, then B has attitude X to Q. r As for gradedness, if a property P in a pretence corresponds to a property Q in reality, then a degree of holding of P should map to the same degree of holding of Q (unless there is additional evidence about Q). We have produced an experimental implementation that handles rates and dura- tions as VNMAs, but much work remains to be done on other VNMAs. In particular, gradedness is currently handled directly in individual rules – notice the degrees in the metaphorical correspondence used above. In place of this handling, we would like to have instead simpler mapping rules that do not mention degree, relying on a separate, gen- eral mechanism for the degree transfer. Finally, the ATT-Meta approach does not rely on domain distinctions, even theoreti- cally, let alone enshrine them in some way in the implemented system. Although in\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 323 this article we generally adopt the common practice of saying that metaphor transfers information from a source domain to a target domain, the ATT-Meta approach has a dif- ferent stance: metaphor is a matter of trans- ferring from a pretence to reality (or to a surrounding pretence, in the case of serial mixing). Notice that in the mapping rule set out above, reference is made to pretence and reality, not to domains. It does not matter what domains the information used in the pretence comes from, and this means that it does not matter how we may intuitively circumscribe the source and target domains in the metaphor. In particular, it does not matter how close, difﬁcult to distinguish, or overlapping those domains are. In practice, it will often be the case that we can theoret- ically identify a source domain in which the direct meaning of the sentence lies, and that inferences from this meaning also lie within that domain. However, this has no bearing on the course of processing, and the reason- ing within the pretence is not limited by any consideration of domains. Narayanan Srini Narayanan has implemented a meta- phor-understanding system (Narayanan, 1997, 1999) that has mostly been applied to interpreting metaphorical statements about economic policy, where the source domain is that of everyday physical movement activities such as walking, as in the headline “Liberalization plan stumbling.” However, it would appear reasonably straightforward to apply a modiﬁed version of the sys- tem to other source and target domains, and Narayanan (1999) mentions using a health-based source domain. The system has been applied to many utterances about economics from newspa- per articles, and has powerful facilities for addressing subtle aspects of such utterances. However, much as in the case of ATT-Meta, the system does not take sentences as such as input, but rather simple feature-value rep- resentations that could result from initial processing of sentences or other discourse fragments. The system is based on knowing a set of conceptual metaphor maps such as ACTING IS MOVING, OBSTACLES ARE DIFFI- CULTIES, and FAILING IS FALLING. Examples of fragments successfully han- dled include “Liberalization plan stum- bling,” “European Giant falls sick,” “taking a cautious step in the right direction” and “Economic reform is like crossing a river by feeling for the stones.” Narayanan is espe- cially concerned to deal with aspect, that is, the internal temporal structure of events. The system can deal with, for instance, the intermittent nature of an action such as rubbing, the aspect conveyed by the per- fect form of verbs, and aspect conveyed in phrases such as “start to pull out,” “on the verge of,” and “back on track.” Both the source domain and the target domain are represented as ﬁxed network structures, of rather different types. The tar- get domain representation is a “belief net- work” (Pearl, 1986), in which nodes stand for economic variables needed for depict- ing the economic situations of interest. The variables include economic actors (example value: Indian Government), economic pol- icy (example value: capitalism), status of a policy, gross domestic product, geographi- cal location, rate of progress, level of difﬁ- culty (e.g. of implementing a policy), and goals of actors. Each node is repeated across a small sequence of time slices (up to four), so that for instance there is a policy node for time 1, a policy node for time 2, and so on. Nodes are linked together to rep- resent probabilistic relationships between variables. For instance, the links state the conditional probability of policy being such- and-such at time 2 given that it is so-and-so at time 1 and a policy failure happens at time 1. When the belief network is used for infer- ence, particular probability values at nodes are ﬁxed on the basis of input and metaphor- ical transfer, and then the links cause pos- terior probabilities for particular variable values at nodes to be calculated. In this way, the network can probabilistically model a complex unfolding economic situation. The source-domain representation is, roughly speaking, a type of marker pass- ing network in which (the main type of)\n324 JOHN A. BARNDEN nodes represent states that can occur in activities such as walking, falling and getting up. Links between these nodes show how states can (stochastically) be caused by pre- decessor states, and markers passing along these links simulate the progress of activi- ties. The state nodes in the source domain include a subset that serve as the inputs to the system’s metaphorical maps. For instance, the DIFFICULTIES ARE OBSTACLES map responds to the presence of a marker in the bump node in the source-domain net- work and contributes to the setting of the probability level at the difﬁculty node in the target network. One type of map, “parame- ter” maps, handles gradedness. For instance, velocity in the source domain is mapped to rate of progress of a policy in the tar- get domain, or distance travelled in walk- ing to degree of completion of an economic plan. The processing within the source-domain network allows rich examples of map- transcendence to be handled. For instance, consider any discourse fragment that men- tions an economic policy approaching a cliff edge. Recall that falling maps over to failing. Provided that the source-domain network has the right structures to predict falling from walking to the cliff’s edge, the system can infer the target domain conclusion that the economic policy will fail. Clearly, the system makes strong use of source-domain inference, if we regard the mental simulation of activities within the source domain as inference. Furthermore, it is uncertain inference, because of the stochastic nature of marker passing between state nodes. It is clear also from the above that the system places great weight on grad- edness. As for the role of literal meaning, consider the sentence “Economic reform is like cross- ing a river by feeling for the stones.” This will be input to the sentence in the form of a setting of the source-domain network that depicts a ﬁctional entity, corresponding to economic reform, crossing a river, and so on. In this sense, the system constructs a whole literal interpretation ﬁrst. However, the system does not itself evaluate whether eco- nomic reform can itself cross a river, so, as with Hobbs’s approach, MIDAS and ATT- Meta, there is no sense in which the system itself rejects a literal meaning before comput- ing a metaphorical one. The system is, clearly, strongly founded on domain distinctions, which are explicit in the structure of the system. Given the intuitive, qualitative distance between economics and bodily movement, this might not, superﬁ- cially, appear to be a problem. However, var- ious types of extension or enrichment of the system could soon run into problems. For one thing, mental processes are important both for physical activities in the world (e.g. reasoning about what to do at a crossroads) and in the economic domain, and this is already weakly evident in Narayanan’s work. A more detailed treatment of mental pro- cessing in the two domains would require separate and differently organized network structures to handle mental states, whereas intuitively the two domains simply overlap on the matter of mental processes, which themselves could just as much be viewed as forming a domain. Veale: The Sapper System Tony Veale (Veale, 1998; Veale & Keane, 1997) has constructed Sapper, an imple- mented hybrid symbolic/connectionist model for ﬁnding structural analogies. It is based on a semantic network framework in which nodes stand for concepts and between which activation values can ﬂow. The work on Sapper appears to be largely separate from Veale’s work on a “conceptual scaffolding” theory of metaphor (Veale & Keane, 1992). Sapper does not take linguistic input as such, but rather attempts to ﬁnd a metaphor- ical mapping between any two concepts S and T in its network that are from dif- ferent domains, for instance composer and [military] general. In this example, the sys- tem comes up with a rich metaphorical map- ping, involving component correspondences such as orchestra corresponding to army, musician to soldier and musical-instrument to\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 325 musket. In this way it is similar in orienta- tion to analogy-ﬁnding systems in Cognitive Psychology, such as SME and ACME. Indeed, Veale has shown in much detail, both theoretical and experimental, that his system can ﬁnd analogies similar to those found by SME and ACME, while perform- ing less processing. Sapper has a long-term “bridge”-forming aspect and a short-term structure-matching aspect. The former is done in advance of any analogy-ﬁnding, and ﬁnds potential analog- ical correspondences between concepts. It does so by means of purely symbolic pro- cessing over the semantic network, based on certain simple heuristics (a “Triangulation” rule and a “Squaring” rule). Such a poten- tial correspondence is called a bridge and is implemented as a special link between the nodes. Analogy-ﬁnding per se in a particular case, such as for composer and general, con- sists of the short-term structure-matching aspect. This aspect exploits the long-term bridges via activation-spread in a way to be described shortly, and thereby constructs overall, coherent mappings containing com- ponent correspondences such as between orchestra and army in the example above. Structure-matching works in outline as follows, given two nodes S and T, thought of as the source and target nodes respectively. Activation is sent out from S and T, to a prespeciﬁed distance (“horizon”) in the net- work. If the two waves of activation meet at a bridge between two nodes S′ and T′, respec- tively, then the system sees if there is a chain of links from S to S′ that is isomorphic to a chain of links from T to T′. That is, the two chains consist of links of the same types in the same directions. Then for each pair of corresponding nodes on the chains the sys- tem considers them to be mapped to each other, and takes the overall mapping thus deﬁned by the chains to be a partial inter- pretation of the T-is-S metaphor. Now the system takes the “richest” partial interpre- tation found by this method, and considers the remaining ones in descending order of richness, attempting to combine them con- sistently with the richest one. The ﬁnal result is Sapper’s overall metaphorical interpreta- tion of T-is-S. The theory behind Sapper places impor- tant, explicit weight on domains, and domain distinctions are used in the struc- ture-matching process. A domain in Sap- per is relative to a given “root” node. The domain for the node is the region of the semantic network that is reachable from the node via network links in a particular way. However, Veale does not appear to address the difﬁculties arising with source and tar- get domains that intuitively overlap, which would require that activation ﬂow during structure-matching not be domain-conﬁned as he assumes it to be. For instance, drums are used in bands in armies, not just in ordi- nary orchestras. It appears that the processing in Sap- per is entirely symmetrical between source and target, so that for instance “a composer is a general” creates the same metaphori- cal correspondences as “a general is a com- poser.” This may look as though it goes against claims in the metaphor literature (e.g. Ortony, 1979, 197) about the asymme- try of metaphor. However, it is not difﬁcult to bias the processing in Sapper in ways that would asymmetrically affect the activation ﬂow and thus ensure asymmetrical results. Also, Barnden (2001d) argues that asymme- try is a more subtle and delicate matter than it is usually portrayed as being; for exam- ple, the true asymmetry between S-is-T and T-is-S can reside in which particular map- ping links are used in interacting with the overall discourse rather than with whether the links themselves differ between S-is-T and T-is-S. Indeed, on his website Veale describes how Sapper does structural trans- fer, in a way roughly similar to other anal- ogy systems. Structure on the source side that is not paralleled on the target side can be transferred as “candidate inferences” to the target side. Structural transfer from S to T involves different pieces of domain infor- mation from those involved in transfer from T to S, even when the same metaphorical linkages are involved. Sapper could be said to perform source- domain inference in using activation ﬂow\n326 JOHN A. BARNDEN within that domain. Activation levels re- present gradedness, for instance the degree to which the property denoted by the node holds. The levels therefore do not represent degrees of certainty, as they do in many con- nectionist systems. Discussion: Contributions of AI to Metaphor Research Here we examine some speciﬁc issues on which AI is being helpful to metaphor research. We will draw heavily on the pre- ceding review of particular AI approaches, but will also make additional observations. Mundaneness Non-AI research such as that of Lakoff (Lakoff, 1993; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and of many researchers in Corpus Linguistics and Applied Linguistics has shown us that metaphor is an aspect of ordinary, every- day language, not just of literary or other heightened forms. AI is in a peculiar posi- tion to add both to the appreciation of the variety and complexity of metaphor as it arises in practical discourse and to the ques- tion of how to process real metaphor in practical contexts, because of the inclusion within AI of applications-oriented research. One of the AI systems reviewed above (MIDAS, by James Martin) concentrated on metaphor arising in question-and-answer sessions between users and an automated Unix help system. Narayanan’s research used the domain of economics as an appli- cation area. A research project led by the present author, not reviewed above but drawing upon the ATT-Meta research, is looking at the metaphorical expression of affect (emotion, value judgments, etc.) in the context of an e-drama system that sup- ports virtual dramatic improvisation by users sitting at computer terminals (Zhang, Barn- den, & Hendley, 2005). Improvisations can be on any topic, but the system has in par- ticular been used for improvisations con- cerning school bullying and embarrassing illnesses. Non-Assertional Metaphor One consequence of looking at applications is as follows. In describing MIDAS we cited a metaphorical question as an example – “How do I get into Emacs?” It is remarkable, though not generally remarked upon, that the vast bulk of writing on metaphor has concentrated on assertions. Yet, metaphor is just as appropriate in questions, com- mands, and so on, as it is in assertions, and often occurs in non-assertions in real dis- course. Non-assertional metaphor raises spe- cial issues. Questions and commands are usually not about conveying new informa- tion about the target or making the under- stander appreciate the target in a special way, yet existing theorizing on the meanings or connotations of metaphorical utterances presupposes that some new information or special view of the target is being com- municated. In particular, whereas with an assertional metaphorical utterance an incompatibility between one potential inter- pretation and the target domain may indicate that the interpretation is incorrect, in the case of a metaphorical question the incompatibility may mean simply that a neg- ative response is needed or the speaker has an incorrect supposition about the target domain, so that an answer could be directed at countering this. It could turn out that particular existing theories based on asser- tional metaphor could be smoothly general- ized to deal with non-assertional metaphor, but the issue needs at least to be explicitly addressed. Details of Mappings Much work on metaphor outside AI has speciﬁed particular mappings between sources and targets. The mappings are often backed up by discursive accounts of how they could help in the understanding of particular example utterances or types of utterance. However, without their being embedded in a detailed computational sys- tem it is difﬁcult to determine whether, on the one hand, the mappings really do achieve all the effects they are credited\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 327 with, and whether, on the other hand, they successfully avoid interacting to produce unwanted side-effects. In other words, map- pings proposed in non-AI literature on metaphor are typically only vaguely evalu- ated as to coverage, coherence, and effec- tiveness. In contrast, systems such as MIDAS and ATT-Meta provide a framework within which to do extensive experimentation with alternative sets of mappings. Source-Domain Reasoning and Pretence Reasoning Several of the reviewed AI systems (those of Hobbs, Martin, Narayanan) make cru- cial use of online source-domain inference: inference that is in terms of the source- domain subject matter and that is made at the time of trying to understand a metaphorical utterance. Source-domain rea- soning was also brieﬂy advocated in the work of Carbonell (1982) on metaphor in AI. The ATT-Meta system is centred on the closely related notion of within-pretence reasoning. Now, source-domain inference has arisen quite frequently in the non-AI literature. For example, comments in Lakoff (1993) and Lakoff and Turner (1989, 62, 64, 94) sug- gest the use of source-domain inference. The discussion of metaphorical inference pat- terns in Turner (1987) appears to allow for online source-domain inference. The work of Ruiz de Mendoza Ib´a˜nez (1999) on inter- actions between metonymy and metaphor includes mention of metonymy occurring within the source domain of a metaphor, and this amounts to a type of online source- domain inference. As for online within- pretence reasoning, Levin’s (1988) work on metaphor in literature implies the use of it, and van Dijk (1980) provides a tentative account of metaphor in terms of counter- factuals. The “blending” (“conceptual inte- gration” approach) in Cognitive Linguistics (Fauconnier & Turner 1998), when applied to metaphor, makes inference within the blend-space central. A blend-space is similar to a pretence cocoon in ATT-Meta, though the latter concept is more computationally speciﬁc while being unconstrained by no- tions of domain. But the study of source-domain rea- soning and within-pretence reasoning in AI research on metaphor has given ﬂesh to and clariﬁed the somewhat schematic and limited discussion of it in the non- AI literature. What AI can distinctively contribute is detailed, effective mecha- nisms for performing it. Complex tech- nical matters of representation, reasoning, and evidence-comparison are involved here, especially when uncertainty and gradedness are brought in. The reason for the intense attention to source-domain and within-pretence reason- ing in AI may be that, in concentrating on real examples of metaphor in mundane contexts, the researchers concerned have been affected by the fact that truly novel metaphor is far from being predominant in metaphor in real discourse, and have concen- trated on the rich, open-ended exploitation of already-known mappings. Source-domain or within-pretence inference enables the map-transcending aspects of the utterance – the aspects not directly handled by known mappings – to be linked to the aspects that are so handled. Map-transcendence is a cen- tral problem of metaphor that has not been adequately treated, although the Hobbs, Martin, Narayanan, and Barnden approaches are important developments. Economizing on Parallelism, and Use of Disanalogies Hobbs, Narayanan, and Barnden all recog- nize that much or all of what one needs to get out of a map-transcending metaphor- ical utterance can often or perhaps usu- ally be got without ﬁnding target-domain cor- respondents for the map-transcending items. This stance is against the idea that the fun- damental task in metaphor understanding is to establish new mappings; indeed, to establish as much parallelism as possible between the two domains. Rather, the three approaches seek to exploit as far as pos- sible the already known mappings. In par- ticular, Barnden, Helmreich, Iverson, and\n328 JOHN A. BARNDEN Stein (1996) explicitly championed the the- sis that it is often misguided to think that map-transcending source-domain elements should be expected to have a parallel in the target, let alone to think that it is proﬁtable to look for it. For example, it seems excessive to expect the “dim recesses” mentioned in “The idea was in the dim recesses of Tony’s mind” to actually corre- spond to any identiﬁable components of the mind in reality, rather than serving merely to connote physical inaccessibility within the metaphorical pretence. On the other hand, there are certainly situations where one needs to ﬁnd some target-domain correspon- dents. The question of which these situa- tions are is an outstanding research issue, on which a start is made in Barnden and Lee (2001). Relatedly, the beneﬁts of attending to disanalogies between source and target in metaphor deserve more study. Fass’s system (meta5) is unusual, and unique among the systems reviewed, in regarding disanalogies between source and target as a source of use- ful information. Dissolving Metaphorical Transfers into the Overall Processing The Hobbs and Barnden approaches achieve great ﬂexibility in allowing target-domain (or within-reality) reasoning steps, source- domain (or within-pretence) reasoning steps, and metaphorical transfer steps to be arbitrarily mixed together in a completely uniform and task-dependent way. This ﬂex- ibility is a contribution to conceptions of how the different types of processing in metaphor can ﬁt together. Most discussions of metaphor appear to assume that transfer steps occur in some special phase of process- ing. The ﬂexibility of mixing is aided by cast- ing mappings as inference rules that are applied in the same way as other rules. Usually in metaphor research, whether in AI or elsewhere, mappings are a different sort of entity, which inhibits even the realization that a uniform treatment would be liberating and beneﬁcial. Context and Extent It is often pointed out that the informa- tion conveyed by a metaphorical utter- ance can be highly sensitive to context, and a considerable amount of psychologi- cal experimentation and philosophical the- orizing has addressed this (e.g. Giora, 1997; Leezenberg, 1995; Stern, 2000). Context is important for the understanding of much non-metaphorical language as well, but metaphor heightens its effect. The sentence “Mike is a rock” is highly indeterminate as to what it might convey, absent any speciﬁc context. Perhaps the speaker is intending to convey that Mike can be relied upon. However, in “Mike’s friends are very upset by criticism, but he’s a rock” the contribution of “rock” is much more def- inite. It is probably not getting at Mike’s reliability: the sentence is arguably saying that Mike is highly tolerant of criticism, and if so it is presumably exploiting a correspon- dence between invulnerability of rocks to physical assault and tolerance of criticism by people. In this example the disambiguating con- text about Mike’s friends and criticism is near to the metaphorical clause, but in other cases the necessary contextual information might arise from further aﬁeld, and might have to be derived from the surrounding passage or other information by subtle or knowledge-intensive processes of inference. Thus, a full approach to metaphor must deal with possibly complex, extensive passages of discourse, and complex inference. Although AI work on metaphor has yet to address context fully, some of the systems reviewed above give context a crucial guiding role and are at least in a position to accommodate its effects smoothly. Hobbs and Barnden place much weight on reasoning goals derived from context as a crucial driver of what metaphorical interpretations are drawn, and their approaches are unusual amongst detailed metaphor-processing schemes in this respect. Contextual-goal drivenness is a powerful tool not only against the often-noted indeterminacy of metaphorical\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 329 meaning (see e.g. Stern, 2000) but also against the problem of inappropriate or irrelevant aspects of the source domain getting in the way (such as the shape of a pig’s tail when classifying a person as a pig). In a contextual-goal driven approach, those irrelevant aspects will simply tend not to be queried. As we have made clear, many authors outside AI have discussed the importance of context. What AI can contribute is detailed, computationally tested mecha- nisms by which it can be brought to bear. Uncertainty The information gained from metaphor is generally uncertain. The indeterminateness of the import of “Mike is a rock” without a sufﬁciently speciﬁc context is itself a type of uncertainty. Even with the context shown above, we cannot be certain that Mike is tol- erant of criticism (according to the speaker). Perhaps, after all, the speaker is intending to convey that Mike can be relied upon to give support to his colleagues when they are upset by criticism. But even if an interpretation in terms of Mike’s tolerance to criticism is correct, we cannot be certain about the degree of tolerance: perhaps the speaker is merely try- ing to say that Mike has a normal level of tol- erance, in contrast to his colleagues’ marked lack of tolerance. After all, different types of rock have different degrees of vulnerabil- ity to physical assault, and, without further information, it can merely be a presumption that a rock has a high degree of invulnerabil- ity. Therefore as well as the uncertainty arising between there being qualitatively different possible interpretations (e.g. one appealing to reliability and one appealing to tolerance), there is also uncertainty aris- ing from within the source domain itself. Another example of the latter phenomenon would arise from talking about someone “burying” an idea in his mind. In the phys- ical world, once something is buried it (at best) only normally stays buried. There can therefore be no certainty that the idea will not “pop up” again. Most work on metaphor sidesteps de- tailed considerations of uncertainty, although systems such as SME and ACME, where there are scoring mech- anisms, do provide some support for a restricted type of uncertainty handling. Amongst our reviewed AI systems, those of Narayanan, Hobbs, and Barnden all allow the system’s source-domain rea- soning and target-domain reasoning to be uncertain. Uncertainty is important for making the overall processing do justice to people’s use of metaphor, but greatly complicates the technical nature of the computational framework. Source/Target Overrides The uncertainty issue also reveals the impor- tance of often allowing information trans- ferred from source to target to override information about the target. This possibil- ity is under-studied in metaphor research, because usually the information about a tar- get domain is cast simplistically in the form of certainties which cannot be overridden. This practice has led to researchers, out- side AI and within, almost exclusively con- centrating on the fact that target-domain information must sometimes override what comes from the source. Of course, this is indeed appropriate in many cases: since it is certain that France and Germany are not cognitive agents and are therefore incapable of love, metaphorically casting the relation- ship of those countries within the EU as a “marriage” (Musolff, 2004) should not lead to the result that they love each other in reality. But, if a piece of target-domain knowl- edge is not certain, but let us say merely a default, there is no reason in principle why the information should not be over- ridden by transfers from the source. Thus, “SnakeByte Technologies nursed its com- petitor RabbitWare Inc. back to health” would override the default that compet- ing companies do not normally deliberately help each other. The utterance “In the far\n330 JOHN A. BARNDEN reaches of her mind, Anne believed that Kyle had been unfaithful” defeats the normal presumption that people’s thoughts about their spouses’ possible affairs are central and conscious ones. It may even be that one important function of metaphor is to con- vey situations that are exceptions to target- domain defaults. The exception-expressing function of metaphor may be especially sig- niﬁcant given that exceptional situations are less likely to be easily expressible using the resources native to the target domain. It appears that only in the context of the ATT-Meta system has the process of source- over-target overriding been studied in com- putational detail, though see Indurkhya (1992, 85–86) for other comments on the importance of such overriding. In ATT- Meta, both directions of override are possi- ble, depending on the ﬁne detail of the rea- soning lines involved in particular cases. Gradedness The rock example above brings out the importance of matters of graded- ness (degree) in metaphor. It is grada- tions, not black-and-white propositions, that metaphor is often getting at, a point that deserves greater emphasis in metaphor research. The interpretation suggested for “Mike’s friends get very hurt by criticism, but he’s a rock” was not the bald proposi- tion that Mike is tolerant of criticism but that he is highly so. Equally, the sentence “The memory was hidden far back in the labyrinth of John’s memory” plausibly does not convey that the memory was completely inaccessible to John but rather that it was highly inaccessible, or very difﬁcult to access. A range of speciﬁc examples of gradedness in metaphor interpretation can be found in Barnden (2001b, 2001c). Once gradedness and uncertainty are considered it also becomes evident that a metaphorical utterance may not necessar- ily introduce totally new information but may rather change the degree of hold- ing, and/or the certainty, of some existing piece of information. Gibbs and Tendahl (2006) discuss this under the heading of the “strengthening” of (and the opposite: contra- diction of) existing assumptions, in the light of considerations of metaphor in Relevance Theory (Carston, 2002; Sperber & Wilson, 1995). In the rock example, other evidence may already have established that Mike may be somewhat insensitive to criticism, so the sentence is both strengthening the may to presumably and strengthening the somewhat to highly. Note also that such strengthening goes beyond the notion that metaphor can draw attention to or increase the salience of (Ortony, 1979) pieces of information about the target domain. We are talking instead about adjusting pieces of information about the target domain. It cannot be claimed that AI or any other ﬁeld has developed generally accepted, com- prehensive methods for handling graded- ness. Nevertheless, Narayanan and Barnden place weight on the handling of gradedness and the transfer of graded information from source to target. Perhaps as important as the actual handling of gradedness in some recent AI metaphor systems is the sheer fact that the pressure in AI towards considering the details of processing practical examples in realistic contexts makes one more readily appreciate the central role that gradedness plays in metaphor (going beyond the obvi- ous role of gradedness in scale-based concep- tual metaphors such as MORE IS UP). Domain Distinctions Metaphor is frequently characterized as a matter of mappings or transfers between dif- ferent “domains,” often to make a contrast with metonymy, which is often claimed to operate within a single domain. On the other hand, some authors have questioned the use- fulness of the domain notion or the degree of distinctness that is required between the two domains in a metaphor (see e.g. Dirven & P¨orings, 2002; Kittay, 1989). For simplic- ity of discussion we have sometimes used the notion of domain uncritically in this article. It is certainly true that in much metaphor there is an intuitive sense in which the source and target are qualitatively very different. The question is whether real sense can be\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 331 made of this and whether it matters to metaphor processing anyway. The present author found, in his own AI work on the ATT-Meta approach, the detail and clarity required for well-founded com- putational implementation to be a major factor in his coming to doubt the useful- ness of the concept of “domain” in study- ing metaphor (and metonymy). In trying to make decisions about what domains partic- ular pieces of knowledge should be assigned to he came to realize what a hopeless and arbitrary task it was. The resulting despair was relieved by an ultimate realization that having domain distinctions was not opera- tionally useful in any case. The nature of the other systems in the review above also throws doubt on the usefulness of the notion. Only Veale and Narayanan actually have domains affect how their systems are structured and how the processing works. Hobbs does believe that metaphor is a matter of mapping between qualitatively disparate domains, but this stance has no operational effect in his sys- tem. In contrast, Barnden regards this dis- parateness as merely being a common case and is happy for the two sides of a metaphor to be arbitrarily close in their qualitative nature. Metaphors such as “Thatcher was Britain’s Reagan” are common, and have source and target domains that are broadly similar in subject matter. For an example with even less qualitative distance between the two sides, one’s neighbour’s teenage children can act as a metaphor for one’s own: if one has a daughter Jenny and the neighbours have a son Jonathan who behaves similarly to Jenny, then one could say “Jenny is our family’s Jonathan.” Of course, it is open to someone to say that the Jenny family is qualitatively different from the Jonathan family, and that they are therefore different domains, but this is post hoc rationalization with no operational signiﬁcance. Despite the closeness between target and source in the Jenny/Jonathan example, the metaphorical utterance appears quite apt to the present author. If this impression is shared with others, it may appear to conﬂict with the evidence adduced by Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) that the greater the conceptual distance between source and target the more apt the metaphor. How- ever, note that the linguistic form of the metaphorical utterance and the presence of context are important factors. A bald state- ment that “Jenny is Jonathan” without much context might well not come over as apt. Apart from considerations of overall qual- itative closeness, there is often a con- siderable amount of overlap between the intuitive source and target domains in metaphor even when they otherwise differ a great deal. We noted some overlap between the economics (target) and health (source) domain in the Narayanan discussion – and we could also have pointed out that health services are part of the economy – and between the orchestra and army domains in the Veale discussion. With reference to the Fass discussion, the domain of cars involves the domain of animals because cars can carry people and other animals. It is quite possible to maintain a ﬁction that domains do real work in metaphor as long as one only deals schematically with some isolated examples, and does not try to come up with a uniﬁed and processu- ally detailed approach to metaphor that can work on a wide variety of metaphors on the basis of the same overall knowledge base. Relationship to Metonymy The relationship of metaphor to metonymy is highly contentious and complex (Dirven & P¨orings, 2002; Fass, 1997). It has proved dif- ﬁcult to distinguish clearly between the two phenomena, and they may be at ends of a spectrum within which many compromises are possible. Particular discourse examples are often hard to classify as to whether they exhibit metonymy or metaphor. Also, metaphor and metonymy often co-occur in richly interactive ways in discourse. How- ever, there has been little work on process- ing accounts that handle both phenomena. As it happens, two of the AI approaches reviewed above – those of Hobbs and Fass – pay much attention to metonymy as well\n332 JOHN A. BARNDEN as to metaphor, and allow certain types of interaction. They complement work such as that of Ruiz de Mendoza Ib´a˜nez (1999) and Goossens (1990) outside AI. Hobbs’s approach is perhaps especially noteworthy in that, as in the case of metaphor, it embeds metonymy as just one type of inference within the system’s inferencing as a whole (Hobbs et al., 1993). Therefore, in princi- ple, arbitrarily complex and diverse mixes of metaphor and metonymy should be able to be handled, and it is likely that compro- mises between metaphor and metonymy are possible. If domains are abandoned as a well- founded underpinning for metaphor, then metaphor cannot be distinguished from metonymy on the usual ground of between- domain moves versus within-domain moves. Thus, any profound effect that metaphor research in AI and other disciplines may ulti- mately have on the fate of domains must be matched by a profound effect on the metaphor/metonymy relationship. The Literal: Its Nature and Use Strongly related to the domains issue is a theme that appears throughout the ﬁeld of metaphor, and continues to be a mat- ter of debate in the ﬁeld (Gibbs & Tendahl, 2006): the role, if any, of the literal mean- ing of metaphorical utterances (or words in them) in deriving their metaphorical meaning. Of the systems reviewed, only Fass’s (meta5) has any use for the idea of having to reject a literal interpretation before consider- ing a metaphorical one, and even in his case the incremental semantic processing (while problematic in itself) means that the rejec- tion is by sentence-part rather than by whole sentence. See Lytinen, Burridge, and Kirt- ner (1992) for another system with a related incremental quality. The approaches of Hobbs, Martin, and Narayanan do rely on constructing a lit- eral interpretation of a metaphorical sen- tence, or sentence-like subunit such as a clause. Barnden’s approach is similar in this respect, though there it is a “direct” meaning that is constructed, with the ques- tion of whether it is necessarily to be called the literal interpretation being left as a ter- minological side issue. It should not be feared that there is necessarily any conﬂict between these approaches and psycholog- ical experimental results about metaphor processing being about as fast as, or some- times faster than, literal-language processing under certain conditions (see e.g. Gibbs & Tendahl, 2006, for a discussion of such results). This speediness does not of itself show that literal meanings are not being computed. The evidence on these matters from psychological experiment is mixed, because it is bound up with the nature of the context of the metaphorical utter- ance and the novelty or otherwise of its metaphorical elements: context could by itself suggest part or all of the meaning, and a piece of familiar metaphorical terminol- ogy could have its target-domain meaning listed in a lexicon. Also, the type of literal (or direct) meaning that is constructed in the aid of metaphor understanding is plau- sibly less fully ﬂedged than that needed in cases where the linguistic string really should be interpreted literally. In the latter case, the literal meaning itself needs to involve integration with the context, whereas in the metaphor case it is instead the metaphor- ical meaning that needs to be fully inte- grated with context. It is possible that all that the metaphorical processing is adding is the occasional hop from a complex source- domain (or pretence) scenario into a target- domain (or reality) scenario, and the time for such hops could be swamped by the time needed for all the other processing going on, such as anaphor resolution and seman- tic/pragmatic inferencing of many other types. AI can contribute here in clarifying the overall computations needed and how they can be imaginatively structured and optimized. Finally, note that serial mixing (chaining) of metaphor complicates the role of literal meaning in metaphor, as noted in the dis- cussion of ATT-Meta. What is transferred online in metaphor can already be a prod- uct of online metaphorical transfer.\nMETAPHOR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 333 Transfer of Attitudes and Value Judgments A metaphorical utterance often conveys or instigates a mental or emotional attitude or a value judgment about the target sub- ject matter. This is perhaps especially preva- lent in metaphor used in political discourse (see e.g. Musolff, 2004). The attitude or judgment can be on the part of some per- son mentioned in the discourse, or it can be on the part of the speaker/hearer. For instance, talking about somebody’s mind as if it were a “cess-pit” may be intended to make the hearer have an emotional revul- sion to, or negative value judgment of, the ideas of that person. On the other hand, say- ing that “The problem crushed Mike into the ground” primarily conveys something about Mike’s emotions, although of course it can also engender the meta-emotion of sorrow about Mike’s feelings. Although attitudes such as emotions and value judgments are of widely recognized importance for metaphor, it is important to have detailed accounts of how exactly they may be processed in metaphor under- standing. The processing of attitudes inter- acts heavily with ordinary inferencing, rather than being an isolatable matter. In addition, emotions and value judgments are intrinsi- cally graded, so the theme in this subsection interacts strongly with the general gradeness issue we identiﬁed above. The description of the ATT-Meta project mentioned that mechanisms are being devel- oped in that project for transferring attitudes and value judgments from source to tar- get by default, whatever the particular con- ceptual metaphor involved, obviating the need for special mechanisms per conceptual metaphor. Connections to Reasoning about Beliefs Little research into metaphor has taken into account the fact that if a hearer wishes to understand what a speaker means by a particular metaphorical utterance, it is the speaker’s beliefs about the target and source domains, and so on, that are important, not the hearer’s. In effect, the metaphorical pro- cessing should occur within the speaker’s “belief space” (as perceived by the hearer). Relatedly, metaphor can occur within the complement clauses of mental state verbs, as in “Mary believes that SnakeByte nursed RabbitWare back to health.” One interpreta- tion of such a sentence is that the metaphor- ical conception of the target is Mary’s own (or rather, Mary’s own, as viewed by the speaker), not (directly) the speaker’s. In this case, metaphorical processing should be embedded within a belief space for Mary (within a belief space of the speaker). Stern (2000) and van Dijk (1980) are rare in metaphor research in addressing these issues, albeit only in an abstract way. The issues are important in the ATT- Meta project. As well as handling metaphor, the ATT-Meta system can perform reasoning about agents’ beliefs and reasoning. Methods are being developed for processing metaphor within the context of a speciﬁc agent’s beliefs rather than within the system’s own view of reality. This involves embedding a pretence cocoon within a belief space for the agent. Conversely, in personiﬁcation metaphor, it can be necessary to reason about the beliefs and reasoning of the entity that is metaphor- ically viewed as a person. This involves, in ATT-Meta terms, embedding a belief space within a pretence cocoon. Reversed Transfers The ATT-Meta approach is unusual in advo- cating that “reverse transfers” – transfers of information from target to source domain (more properly, reality to pretence) – are useful in metaphor understanding. One rea- son is the reverse transfer of reasoning queries that arise (notionally) from con- text. A query in target-domain terms can be reversed-transferred to become a query in source-domain terms, and an example was given in the review of ATT-Meta above. This and two other reasons for doing reverse transfers are discussed at length in Barnden et al. (2004). One of them is based on an argument that, in the case of a conceptual\n334 JOHN A. BARNDEN metaphor being used in a distributed way across multiple utterances, it may be easier and more effective to form a coherent sce- nario in source-domain terms than to do so directly in target-domain terms by translat- ing each metaphorical utterance into target- domain terms. This approach can instead involve “metaphorizing” the literal sentences in the relevant discourse segment: translat- ing the information in them into source- domain terms. We present this possibility as a potentially fruitful topic for future research into metaphor. Conclusion AI is not just about the engineering of “intelligent” artefacts for useful purposes but also about mapping out the space of pos- sible principles and mechanisms of cogni- tion, whether artiﬁcial or natural. For the Engineering aim, metaphor is an impor- tant challenge, and AI can draw here on insights on the problem from many other disciplines. Conversely, through its non- Engineering aims, various features of AI – its partial applications focus, its input from Computer Science, its need or ambition to produce detailed processing accounts – put AI in a good position to help metaphor research. The help can consist of facilitat- ing certain types of advance, identifying cer- tain types of neglected problem, or effect- ing salutory changes of emphasis. This is not to say that these advances, problem identiﬁ- cations, and emphasis shifts could not arise from other disciplines, but just that AI is especially well-placed to generate them. Speciﬁc helpful things that one can point to already as coming out of AI research on metaphor – whether they are advances, problem identiﬁcations, or emphasis shifts – include the working out of detailed mech- anisms for source-domain reasoning, the detailed elaboration of the alternative notion of within-pretence reasoning for metaphor, the casting of mappings as inference rules, the emphasis on and inclusion of gradedness in metaphor interpretation, mechanisms for exploiting context, the thorough inclusion of uncertainty into metaphorical reason- ing, a richer view of overriding (source- over-target as well as target-over-source), important steps towards integration with metonymy interpretation, some emphasis on disanalogy, the usefulness of reversed transfers, steps towards mechanisms for han- dling the default transfer of attitudes and value judgments, the importance of non- assertional metaphor, enriched doubt about domains, and clariﬁcation and speciﬁcation of ways in which literal meaning can be involved in metaphor interpretation. All these matters require much further research, within AI and outside. But let us celebrate the fact that metaphor is, par excellence, an area for truly interdisciplinary investigation!

Introduction After ﬁnding “conclusive” radio proof of intelligent aliens, Dr. Ellie Arroway, an attractive, competent, and passionate sci- entist, ﬁnds herself discussing with high- level politicians over the urgency of under- standing such extraterrestrial messages. In response to the mocking question of “why don’t they [the aliens] just speak English?” she serenely and convincingly answers with- out the slightest hesitation: “Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.” The line is from the movie Contact, writ- ten by the Pulitzer Prize–winning author Carl Sagan, in which the hero (played by Jodie Foster) brings forth a deep and widespread belief that mathematics is “out there,” constituting the very fabric of the cosmos, and transcending not only the exis- tence of human beings, but of any possible beings in the universe. This view is uncon- sciously swallowed and sustained by mil- lions through other similar movies and pop- science books (some of them written by well-known scientists like Carl Sagan him- self). But this view of mathematics doesn’t only exist in Hollywood and the general media. It is also alive in many mathemat- ics and philosophy departments, as well as in other academic institutions that endorse different forms of Platonism. The belief is deep and often unnoticed and unquestioned: mathematics, whose existence is indepen- dent of human beings, is the ultimate uni- versal language. But, is it? In this chapter, I want to defend a radically different view of the nature of mathematics. One that, building on ﬁnd- ings in cognitive science – especially Con- ceptual Metaphor Theory, Gesture studies, and on the embodied foundations of human thinking – sees mathematics as an all too human enterprise. I will start by describing what George Lakoff and I, in our book Where Mathematics Comes From, called “The Romance of Mathematics” (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000). I will argue that when the under- standing of the nature of mathematics is concerned, this common view is at odds with ﬁndings in the contemporary scientiﬁc study of the human mind. Then, in order to illustrate the crucial constitutive role that conceptual metaphor – along with other 339\n340 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ mechanisms of the human mind – play in the genesis of mathematical ideas, I will analyze a case study involving the elusive notions of limits and continuity in modern math- ematics. Based on the work I have done with Lakoff in what we have called the Cognitive Science of Mathematics (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 1997, 1998, 2000; N´u˜nez & Lakoff, 1998, 2005), I will eventually argue that formal deﬁnitions and formal languages in mathematics, although extremely useful in the praxis of the discipline, don’t capture the full content of mathematical ideas. For- mal mathematics is not all of mathematics, and cannot provide a foundational account of the nature of mathematics. I will ana- lyze the conceptual metaphors and other everyday bodily grounded mechanisms that provide the inferential organization of such concepts as limits and continuity of real- valued functions. Then, as an extension to this work, I will address the issue of the psychological reality of such metaphor- ical mechanisms via the study of real time speech–gesture co-production. We’ll see that the essential and constitutive meaning that these metaphors provide is not captured by the usual technical formalisms that are taken as the deﬁnition of what mathemat- ics really is. Finally, I will close the chapter with an analysis of some philosophical and theoretical implications of this embodied- oriented view of the nature of mathematics, in which conceptual metaphor plays a fun- damental role in making mathematics what it is. As we’ll see, the ontology of mathemat- ics is not left untouched. 2. The Romance of Mathematics The idea that mathematics exists “out there,” timeless and eternal, transcending human beings, and constituting the “only truly uni- versal language,” is a natural idea. After all, the reasoning goes, is it not the case that the truth of the Pythagorean Theorem is valid everywhere? Not only in Greece, but also in Easter Island, in the South Pole, at the bot- tom of the Paciﬁc Ocean, on the moon, in Saturn, or anywhere in the universe? And is it not the case that the validity of that theo- rem transcends time, such that its truth was not only valid during the time of the Greeks, but it is still valid now, and it will continue to be valid forever? Is it not the case that the constant π expresses a universal property, namely, the ratio between the perimeter of a circumference and its diameter? Is this not a truth that any intelligent being anywhere in the universe would be able to grasp? Indeed, it is not easy to see that these mathematical truths are in fact the product of human imagination, very peculiar, objec- tive, stable, effective, abstract, well-adapted, and robust ones, but human nonetheless. These extraordinary properties make math- ematics a unique form of knowledge, which is gathered not through empirical evidence (as it is done in science via experimen- tal and correlational studies) but through formal proof. A piece of mathematical knowledge is accepted by the mathemati- cal community only if there is a proof of its absolute certainty (not just by providing sta- tistically signiﬁcant robust evidence for it, as it is done in science). These unique prop- erties give mathematics the aura of being predominantly about timeless eternal objec- tive truths, providing structure and order to the universe. As the great Galileo – founder of modern science – said, “The laws of the universe are written in mathematics. It is our role to learn how to read them.” In the preface of our book Where Math- ematics Comes From, George Lakoff and I called this widespread folk and academic conception of the nature of mathemat- ics, the Romance of mathematics, a kind of mythology that goes like this (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000, xv): r Mathematics has a truly objective exis- tence, providing structure to this universe and any possible universe, independent of and transcending the existence of human beings or any beings at all. r Mathematics is abstract and disem- bodied – yet it is real. r Human mathematics is just a part of abstract, transcendent mathematics (the concrete and mundane side of it).\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 341 r Hence, mathematical proof allows us to discover transcendent truths of the uni- verse. r Mathematics is part of the physical uni- verse and provides rational structure to it. There are Fibonacci series in ﬂowers, log- arithmic spirals in snails, fractals in moun- tain ranges, and π in the spherical shape of stars and planets and bubbles. Hundreds of books showing how “wonderful” and “magic” mathematics is, continuously sus- tain this belief. r Mathematics even characterizes logic, and hence structures reason itself – any form of reason by any possible being. r To teach and to learn mathematics is therefore to teach and to learn the lan- guage of nature, a mode of thought that would have to be shared by any highly intelligent beings anywhere in the uni- verse. r Because mathematics is disembodied and pure reason is a form of mathemati- cal logic, pure reason itself is disembod- ied. Hence, machines can, in principle, think. This view is often carried over to the prac- tice of mathematics teaching. As a result there is an overemphasis on dogmatic ori- ented forms of education instantiated via formal deﬁnitions, reductionistic forms of logic, axioms, algorithms, and so forth, all of which result in forgetting the human nature of mathematics. For instance, did your high- school teacher ever really explain to you, in human meaningful terms (not in terms of formal proofs and arbitrary deﬁnitions and axioms), why the multiplication of two neg- ative numbers yields a positive result? Or did your college mathematics professor really explain to you why the empty set is a sub- set of every set? And what that means? How would you explain such simple but profound “truths” to a student or to another colleague? Or how would you explain the meaning of Euler’s famous formula eπ i + 1 = 0, that is, not by providing a proof that the statement is true, but by providing an explanation of why the statement is true by virtue of what it means?1 But despite its immediate intuitiveness, and despite the support it gets from many outstanding physicists and mathematicians, the Romance of mathematics is (nowadays) scientiﬁcally untenable. It is a mythology, and as such, arguing for or against it is a matter of faith, not a matter of scientiﬁc debate. So, moving away from this discussion, in the remainder of the chapter I will argue that addressing the question of the nature of mathematics requires an informed empiri- cal approach: The cognitive science of math- ematics, that is, the study of mathematics as a subject matter for cognitive science. I will claim that this question doesn’t belong exclusively to philosophy or to mathemat- ics proper (where formal proof sufﬁces), but to the contemporary scientiﬁc study of the mind, which by gathering interdisci- plinary efforts from neuroscience to linguis- tics to cognitive psychology can show how the human mind, with the conceptual sys- tems it creates, makes mathematics possible. In this chapter, I’ll focus on ﬁndings in cogni- tive linguistics – a sub-discipline of cognitive science – especially in conceptual metaphor theory. 3. Metaphor in Mathematics? The idea that metaphor plays a constitu- tive role in mathematics seems, at a ﬁrst glance, a ﬂat contradiction. Mathematics is objective, rigorous, unambiguous, and pre- cise. How can metaphor, which appears to lack those features, have anything to do with mathematics? The answer lies in one of the essential properties of mathematics: it is an abstract fully idealized conceptual domain. Indeed, perhaps one of the most striking features of mathematics is that it is char- acterized by the fact that the very entities that constitute what the ﬁeld is are ideal- ized mental abstractions. These entities can- not be perceived directly through the senses. Even, say, a point, which is the simplest entity in Euclidean geometry, can’t be actu- ally perceived. A point, as deﬁned by Euclid is a dimensionless entity, an entity that has\n342 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ only location but no extension. No powerful microscope will ever be able to allow us to actually perceive a point. A point, after all, with its precision and clear identity, is an ide- alized abstract entity. Nowhere is the imag- inary nature of mathematics more evident than in the case of inﬁnity. Because of the ﬁnite nature of our bodies and brains, no direct experience can exist with the inﬁnite itself! Yet, inﬁnity in mathematics is essen- tial. It lies at the very core of many funda- mental concepts such as limits, least upper bounds, topology, mathematical induction, inﬁnite sets, points at inﬁnity in projective geometry, to mention only a few. When studying the very nature of mathematics, the challenging and intriguing question that comes to mind is the following: if mathe- matics is the product of human ideas, how can we explain the nature of mathemat- ics with its unique features such as preci- sion, objectivity, rigor, generalizability, sta- bility, and, of course, applicability to the real world? Such a question doesn’t represent a real problem for approaches inspired in platonic philosophies, which rely on the existence of transcendental worlds of ideas beyond human existence. But this view doesn’t have any support based on scientiﬁc ﬁndings and doesn’t provide any link to current empir- ical work on human ideas and conceptual systems (it may be supported, however, as a matter faith – not science, by many Pla- tonist scientists and mathematicians). The question doesn’t pose major problems to purely formalist philosophies either, because in that worldview mathematics is seen as a rule-driven manipulation of meaningless symbols. The question of the origin of the meaning of mathematical ideas doesn’t even emerge in the purely formalist arena. For those studying the human mind scientiﬁ- cally, however (e.g., cognitive scientists), the question of the nature of mathematics is indeed a real challenge, especially for those who endorse an embodied oriented approach to cognition that sees mind and body as being intimately co-deﬁned. How can an embodied view of the mind give an account of an abstract, idealized, precise, sophisti- cated and powerful domain of ideas if direct bodily experience with the subject matter is by deﬁnition not possible? In Where Mathematics Comes From, Lakoff and I give some preliminary answers to the question of the cognitive origin of mathematical ideas (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000). Building on ﬁndings in mathematical cognition, and using mainly methods from cognitive linguistics, we suggest that most of the idealized abstract technical entities in mathematics are created via human cognitive mechanisms such as conceptual metaphor, that extend the structure of bod- ily experience (thermic, spatial, chromatic, acoustic, etc.) while preserving essential properties of the inferential organization of such domains of bodily experience. For example, as it is explained elsewhere in this volume, linguistic expressions such as “send her my warm helloes” and “the teacher was very cold to me” are statements that refer to the somewhat abstract domain of Affection. From a purely literal point of view, however, the language used belongs to the domain of Thermic experience, not Affection. The meaning of these statements and the inferences one is able to draw from them are structured by precise mappings from the Thermic domain to the domain of Affection: Warmth is mapped onto presence of affection, Cold is mapped onto lack of affection, X is warmer than Y is mapped onto X is more affectionate than Y, and so on. Research in cognitive linguistics has shown that these phenomena are not simply “linguistic” in nature, but rather they are about thought. In cognitive science the com- plexities of such abstract and non/literal phenomena have been studied through mechanisms such as conceptual metaphors (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff, 1993; Lakoff & John- son, 1980; Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 1997; N´u˜nez, 1999, 2000, 2008; Sweetser, 1990), con- ceptual blends (Fauconnier & Turner, 1998, 2002; N´u˜nez, 2005), conceptual metonymy (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), ﬁctive motion, and dynamic schemas (Talmy, 1988, 1996, 2003). Based on these ﬁndings Lakoff and I analyzed many areas in mathematics, from set theory to inﬁnitesimal calculus, to logic, to projective geometry, to transﬁnite arith- metic, by means of a technique we called\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 343 Mathematical Idea Analysis. We showed how, via everyday human embodied mech- anisms such as conceptual metaphor and conceptual blending, the inferential patterns drawn from direct bodily experience in the real world get extended in very speciﬁc and precise ways to give rise to a new emergent inferential organization in purely imaginary domains.2 We found that a great many cognitive mechanisms that are not specif- ically mathematical are used to characterize mathematical ideas. These include such ordinary cognitive mechanisms as those used for basic spatial relations, groupings, small quantities, motion, distributions of things in space, changes, bodily orientations, basic manipulations of objects (e.g., rotat- ing and stretching), iterated actions, and so on. Thus, for example: r Conceptualizing the technical mathe- matical concept of a class makes use of the everyday concept of a collection of objects in a bounded region of space. r Conceptualizing the technical mathe- matical concept of recursion makes use of the everyday concept of a repeated action. r Conceptualizing the technical mathe- matical concept of complex arithmetic makes use of the everyday concept of rotation. r Conceptualizing derivatives in calculus requires making use of such everyday con- cepts as motion, approaching a boundary, and so on. From a non-technical perspective, this should be completely obvious. But from the technical perspective of cognitive science, there is a challenging question one must ask: Exactly what everyday concepts and cognitive mechanisms are used in exactly what ways in the unconscious concep- tualization of technical ideas, such that they provide the precise inferential struc- ture observed in mathematics? Mathemat- ical Idea Analysis, depends crucially on the answers to this question. Lakoff and I have found that mathematical ideas are grounded in bodily based mechanisms and everyday experience. Many mathematical ideas are ways of mathematicizing ordinary ideas, as when the idea of subtraction mathematizes the ordinary idea of distance, or as when the idea of a derivative mathematicizes the ordinary idea of instantaneous change. As we’ll see, conceptual metaphor plays a cru- cial role in realizing the very mathemati- cization process, by extending the inferential organization of everyday bodily grounded experiences to abstract domains. It is now time to analyze some of these ﬁndings in more detail by going over the case study. 4. A Case Study: Limits and Continuity of Functions In the spirit of Mathematical Idea Analy- sis, we can start by taking a look at tech- nical books and articles in mathematics and by carefully analyzing how these texts actu- ally characterize ideas such as limits and continuity. Let us consider the following examples taken from some classic books and textbooks: 1) While discussing limits, we read in the Russian classic Matematika, ee soderzhanie metody i znachenie [Mathematics, its contents, methods and meaning] by A. Aleksandrov, A. N. Kolmogorov, and M. A. Lavrent’ev [1956/1999]: If a variable xn may be represented as a sum xn = a + αn, where a is a constant and αn is an inﬁnitesimal, then we say that the variable xn, for n increasing beyond all bounds, approaches the number a and we write lim xn = a or xn →a The number a is called the limit of xn. (Vol. 1, p. 82, underlined italics are ours). The ﬁrst thing we notice is that, strictly speaking, this statement refers to a\n344 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ sequence of discrete and motionless values (real numbers) that a variable xn takes corresponding to increasing dis- crete and motionless values taken by n. If we examine this statement closely we can see that it describes static facts about numbers. We can observe that there is no motion whatsoever involved. No entity is actually approaching any- thing or moving beyond anywhere. So, why then did these well-respected Rus- sian authors (or why do mathematicians in general, for that matter) use dynamic language to express static properties of static entities? And what does it mean to say that the “variable xn approaches a number a,” when in fact the variable can only have a ﬁxed and distinct value given ﬁxed and distinct values of n? 2) While discussing limits of inﬁnite series, R. Courant & H. Robbins write in their classic book What Is Mathematics (Courant & Robbins, 1978): We describe the behavior of sn by saying that the sum sn approaches the limit 1 as n tends to inﬁnity, and by writing 1 = 1/2 + 1/22 + 1/23 + 1/24 + · · · , where on the right we have an inﬁ- nite series” (p. 64, underlined italics are ours). This statement refers to a sequence of discrete and motion-less partial sums of sn (real numbers), corresponding to increasing discrete and motion-less val- ues taken by n in the expression 1/2n where n is a natural number. If we examine this statement closely we can observe that it describes some facts about numbers, and about the result of discrete operations with numbers. Again, no motion whatsoever is involved. No entity is actually approaching or tending to anything. So why then did Courant and Robbins (or why do math- ematicians in general) use dynamic lan- guage to express static properties of static entities? And what does it mean to say that the “sum sn approaches,” when Figure 19.1. The graph of the function f (x) = sin 1/x. in fact a sum is simply a ﬁxed number, a result of an operation of addition? 3) Later in the book, Courant and Rob- bins analyze cases of continuity and dis- continuity of trigonometric functions in the real plane. Referring to the function f (x) = sin 1/x, whose graph is shown in Figure 19.1, they say: “. . . since the denominators of these fractions increase without limit, the values of x for which the function sin 1/x has the values 1, −1, 0, will cluster nearer and nearer to the point x = 0. Between any such point and the origin there will be still an inﬁnite number of oscillations of the function” (p. 283, underlined italics are ours). Once again, if, strictly speaking, a function is a mapping between elements of a set (coor- dinate values on the x-axis) with one and only one of the elements of another set (coordinate values on the y-axis), all that we have is a static correspondence between points on the x-axis with points on the y- axis. How then can the authors (or mathe- maticians in general) speak of “oscillations of the function,” let alone an inﬁnite number of them? These three simple examples illustrate some deep and important issues regard- ing the semantic structure of mathematical ideas. They show how mathematical ideas and concepts are described, deﬁned, illus- trated, and analyzed in mathematics books. You can pick your favorite mathematics books and you will ﬁnd similar patterns.\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 345 In all three examples above, static numerical structures are involved, such as partial sums and mappings between coordinates on one axis with coordinates on another. Strictly speaking, absolutely no motion or dynamic entities are involved in the formal deﬁni- tions of these terms. So, if no entities are really moving, why do authors continue to speak of “approaching,” “tending to,” and “oscillating”? If mathematical deﬁnitions are indeed so precise, why is there still dynamic language when purely static entities are concerned? Where is this motion coming from? What does dynamism mean in these cases? What role is it playing (if any) in the meaning of these statements about mathe- matics facts? In order to answer these questions we will ﬁrst look at how pure mathematics characterizes real numbers, limits, and con- tinuity of real-valued functions. We will eventually ﬁnd that in these cases the logic of formal mathematics of set-theoretic entities and of universal and existential quantiﬁers is intrinsically static, and that the presence of dynamic content along with its inferen- tial structure is a manifestation of human meaningful cognition that is not captured by mathematics formalisms. Pure Mathematics and Real Numbers In pure mathematics, entities are brought to existence via formal deﬁnitions, formal proofs (theorems), and axiomatic methods (i.e., by declaring the existence of some entity without the need of proof. For exam- ple, in set theory the axiom of inﬁnity assures the existence of inﬁnite sets. Without that axiom, there are no inﬁnite sets). In the case of real numbers, 10 axioms taken together fully characterize this number system and its inferential organization (i.e., theorems about real numbers). The following are the axioms of the real numbers. 1. Commutative laws for addition and multiplication. 2. Associative laws for addition and multi- plication. 3. The distributive law. 4. The existence of identity elements for both addition and multiplication. 5. The existence of additive inverses (i.e., negatives). 6. The existence of multiplicative inverses (i.e., reciprocals). 7. Total ordering. 8. If x and y are positive, so is x + y. 9. If x and y are positive, so is x · y. 10. The Least Upper Bound axiom. The ﬁrst 6 axioms provide the structure of what is called a ﬁeld for a set of num- bers and two binary operations. Axioms 7 through 9 assure ordering constraints. The ﬁrst nine axioms fully characterize ordered ﬁelds, such as the rational numbers with the operations of addition and multiplication. Up to here we already have a lot of structure and complexity. For instance we can charac- terize and prove theorems about all possi- ble numbers that can be expressed as the division of two whole numbers (i.e., rational numbers). Along a line we can also locate (according to their magnitude) any two dif- ferent rational numbers and be sure (via proof) that there will always be (inﬁnitely many) more rational numbers between them (a property referred to as density). With the rational numbers we can describe with any given (ﬁnite) degree of precision the propor- tion given by the perimeter of a circle and its diameter (e.g., 3.14; 3.1415; etc.). With the rational numbers, however, we cannot “complete” the points on the line, and we can not express with inﬁnite exactitude the mag- nitude of the proportion mentioned above (π = 3.14159 . . .). For this, we need the full extension of the real numbers. In axiomatic terms, this is accomplished by the tenth axiom: the Least Upper Bound axiom. All ten axioms characterize a complete ordered ﬁeld. Nothing in the ﬁrst nine axioms of real numbers helps us understanding the origin of motion in the above mathematical state- ments about inﬁnite series, and continuity. All nine axioms simply specify the exis- tence of static properties regarding binary operations and their results, and properties regarding ordering. There is no explicit or\n346 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ implicit reference to motion in these axioms. Since what makes a real number a real num- ber (with its inﬁnite precision) is the Least Upper Bound axiom, it is perhaps this very axiom that hides the dynamic secret we are looking for. Let’s see what this axiom says: 10. Least Upper Bound axiom: every nonempty set that has an upper bound has a least upper bound. And what exactly are an upper bound and a least upper bound? This is what pure math- ematics says: Upper Bound b is an upper bound for S if x ≤b, for every x in S. Least Upper Bound b0 is a least upper bound for S if r b 0 is an upper bound for S, and r b0 ≤b for every upper bound b of S. But once again, all we ﬁnd here are state- ments about motionless entities such as uni- versal quantiﬁers (e.g., for every x; for every upper bound b of S), membership relations (e.g., for every x in S), greater than relation- ships (e.g., x ≤b; b0 ≤b), and so on. In other words, there is absolutely no indication of motion in the Least Upper Bound axiom, or in any of the other nine axioms. In short, the axioms of real numbers, which are supposed to completely characterize the “truths” (i.e., theorems) of real numbers, don’t tell us any- thing about a sum “approaching” a number, or a number “tending to” inﬁnity (whatever that means!). Would the concept of continuity provide the answer? What Is Continuity? What is, according to pure mathematics, continuity of functions? It is common to ﬁnd in mathematics textbooks continuity for functions deﬁned as follows: r A function f is continuous at a number a if the following three conditions are satisﬁed: 1. f is deﬁned on an open interval contain- ing a, 2. limx →a f (x) exists, and 3. limx →a f (x) = f (a). Where by limx →a f (x) what is meant is the following: Let a function f be deﬁned on an open interval containing a, except possibly at a itself, and let L be a real number. The statement limx →a f (x) = L means that ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0, such that if 0 < |x −a|< δ, then | f (x) −L| < ε. As we can see, pure formal mathematics deﬁnes continuity in terms of limits, and limits in terms of static universal and exis- tential quantiﬁers applied on static numbers (e.g., ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0), and the satisfaction of certain conditions which are described in terms of motionless arithmetic difference (e.g., | f (x) −L|) and static smaller than rela- tions (e.g., 0 < |x −a|< δ). Once again, these formal deﬁnitions don’t tell us any- thing about a sum “approaching” a number, or a number “tending to” inﬁnity, or about a function “oscillating” between values (let alone doing it inﬁnitely many times, as in the function f (x) = sin 1/x). A close inspection of mathematics text- books reveals that often, right before giving this formal ε-δ deﬁnition of continuity, a paragraph or two are dedicated to the “informal” characterization of the idea of continuity, one that appeals to an “intu- itive” description. Here is, for instance, the famous Russian book Mathematics, Its Con- tents, Methods and Meaning by Aleksandrov, Kolmogorov, and Lavrent’ev (1956/1999) mentioned earlier: “The general idea of a continuous function may be obtained from the fact that its graph is continuous: that\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 347 is, its curve may be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper.” (p. 88; our emphasis). And here is a quote from the classic textbook Calculus by G. Simmons (1985), while discussing the same topic: “In every- day speech a ‘continuous’ process is one that proceeds without gaps or interruptions or sud- den changes. Roughly speaking, a function y = f (x) is continuous if it displays similar behavior” (p. 58; our emphasis). In both texts, we observe a character- ization of continuous functions given in dynamic terms. In both cases there is some- thing moving: the pencil drawing a curve on the paper in the former, and something unfolding without gaps in the latter. In both cases we have something moving from some position in space towards some other loca- tion in an uninterrupted manner. In both books these dynamic descriptions are given as a way of helping the reader by providing some immediate intuitive idea of what a con- tinuous function means. The Russian book even characterizes the meaning of a “con- tinuous function” in terms of something that is “continuous,” whose meaning corresponds to what Simmons’ Calculus textbook char- acterize as “everyday speech.” This mean- ing corresponds precisely to the concept of natural continuity described by N´u˜nez & Lakoff, 1998): the continuity conceived by the creators of calculus, Leibniz and Newton, in the 17th century, and in fact, all mathematicians up to the 19th century. It is natural continuity that brought Euler to refer to a continuous curve as “a curve described by freely leading the hand” (cited in Stewart, 1995, 237), and the great Kepler to measure “an area swept out by the motion of a (celestial) point on a physical ‘con- tinuous curve’” (Kramer, 1970, 528). Nat- ural continuity – continuity as we nor- mally conceive it outside of mathematics – is based on a source-path-goal schema, a fundamental pre-conceptual image schema concerned with motion which has the fol- lowing elements: a. A trajector that moves b. A source location (the starting point) c. A goal – that is, an intended destination of the trajectory d. A route from the source to the goal e. The actual trajectory of motion f. The position of the trajector at a given time g. The direction of the trajector at that time h. The actual ﬁnal location of the trajector, which may or may not be the intended destination. The source–path–goal schema is very gen- eral and can be extended in many ways: the speed of motion, the trail left by the thing moving, obstacles to motion, forces that move one along a trajectory, additional tra- jectors, and so on. The schema is topological in the sense that a path can be expanded or shrunk or deformed and still remains a path and it has an internal spatial logic and built- in inferences (see Figure 19.2). For instance, If you have traversed a route to a current location, you have been at all previous loca- tions on that route; If you travel from A to B and from B to C, then you have traveled from A to C; If there is a direct route from A to B and you are moving along that route toward B, then you will keep getting closer to B; If X and Y are traveling along a direct route from A to B and X passes Y, then X is further from A and closer to B than Y is; and so on. Building on the source–path–goal sche- ma, natural continuity has the following essential features in its inferential organiza- tion (N´u˜nez & Lakoff, 1998): a. Continuity, traced by motion, takes place over time. b. The trace of the motion is a static holistic line with no “jumps.” None of these features are present in the ε-δ characterization of continuity. And the reason is simple. The ε-δ static character- ization corresponds in fact to a radically different set of human ideas with a differ- ent inferential organization. It corresponds to the static everyday notion of preserva- tion of closeness near a location: being within a given distance from a speciﬁc location.\n348 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ Figure 19.2. The source–path–goal schema (after Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000, 38). We conceptualize linear motion using a conceptual schema in which there is a moving entity (called a trajector), a source of motion, a trajectory of motion (called a path), and a goal with an unrealized trajectory approaching that goal. There is a logic inherent in the structure of the schema. For example, if you are at a given location on a path, you have been at all previous locations on that path. Preservation of closeness has static locations, landmarks, reference-points, distances, but no trajectors, no paths, no directionalities, no motion, and therefore no “jumps.” As I have argued elsewhere in collaboration with G. Lakoff and other colleagues (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 1997, 2000; N´u˜nez & Lakoff, 1998; N´u˜nez, 2000; N´u˜nez, Edwards, & Matos, 1999) “preservation of closeness” is an everyday human concept with a very precise inferential organization, recruited by Cauchy and Weierstrass in the 19th cen- tury to carry out the program of arith- metizing analysis (for details see Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000, chaps. 12–14). Mathemati- cal Idea Analysis shows that the inferen- tial organization of the idea of preserva- tion of closeness is not the same as the one of natural continuity. The two concepts – natural continuity and ε-δ continuity – simply have, cognitively, two radically dif- ferent logics (N´u˜nez & Lakoff, 1998). The fact that the ε-δ deﬁnition doesn’t capture the inferential structure of natu- ral continuity shouldn’t be a surprise. In Where Mathematics Comes From, Lakoff and I showed what well-known contemporary mathematicians had already pointed out in more general terms (Hersh, 1997; Kaput, 1979): r The structure of human mathematical ideas, and its inferential organization, is richer and more detailed than the infer- ential organization provided by formal deﬁnitions and axiomatic methods. For- mal deﬁnitions and axioms neither fully formalize nor generalize human concepts (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000). We can illustrate this with a relatively simple example taken from our book. Con- sider the function f (x) = x sin 1/x whose graph is depicted in Figure 19.3. f (x) = \u0002 x sin 1/x for x ̸= 0 0 for x = 0 According to the ε-δ deﬁnition of conti- nuity this function is continuous at every point. Indeed, for all x, it is always possible\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 349 Figure 19.3. The graph of the function f (x) = x sin 1/x. to ﬁnd the speciﬁed ε’s and δ’s to satisfy the conditions for preservation of close- ness. However, according to natural continuity this function is not continuous. The inferential organization of natural con- tinuity requires that certain conditions have to be met. For instance, in the semantics of a naturally continuous line we should be able to tell how long the line is between two points. We should also be able to describe essential properties of the motion of a point along that line. With this function we can- not do that. Since the function “oscillates” inﬁnitely many times as it “approaches” the point (0, 0) we cannot really tell how long the line is between two points located on the left and right sides of the plane. Moreover, as the function approaches the origin (0, 0) we cannot tell whether it will cross from the right plane to the left plane “going down” or “going up.” As a result, the function violates two essential properties of natural conti- nuity and therefore it is not continuous. Consequently, the formal ε-δ deﬁnition of continuity (1) simply doesn’t capture the inferential organization of the human everyday notion of continuity (natural con- tinuity), and (2) contrary to what is claimed in most mathematics books and textbooks, it does not generalize the notion of continuity either. The function f (x) = x sin 1/x is ε-δ continuous but it is not naturally continuous. The point is that what is characterized formally in mathematics leaves out a huge amount of inferential organization of the human ideas that constitute mathematics. This is precisely what happens with the dynamic aspects of the expressions we saw before, such as “approaching,” “tending to,” “oscillating,” and so on. Motion, in these examples, is a genuine and constitutive man- ifestation of the nature of these mathe- matical ideas. From the point of view of pure mathematics, however, the essential dynamic components of the inferential orga- nization of these ideas are not captured by the ε-δ formalisms and the axiomatic system for real numbers. Conceptual Metaphor and Fictive Motion In the case of limits of inﬁnite series, motion in “the sum sn approaches the limit 1 as n tends to inﬁnity” emerges metaphorically from the successive values taken by n in the sequences as a whole. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into the details of the mappings involved in the various underlying conceptual metaphors that pro- vide the required dynamic inferential organi- zation (for details see Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000, chaps. 8–9). We can point out, however, that there are many conceptual metaphors and metonymies involved. There are con- ceptual metonymies in cases such as a par- tial sum standing for the entire inﬁnite sum; there are conceptual metaphors in cases where we conceptualize the sequence of these metonymical sums as a unique tra- jector moving in space (as it is indicated by the third-person singular verb conjuga- tion in “the sum sn approaches”); there are conceptual metaphors for conceiving inﬁn- ity as a single location in space such that a metonymical n (standing for the entire sequence of values) can “tend to;” there are conceptual metaphors for conceiving the number “1” (not as a mere natural number but as an inﬁnitely precise real number) as the result of the inﬁnite sum; and so on. Notice that none of these expressions can be literal. The facts described in these sen- tences do not exist in any real perceivable world. They are metaphorical in nature. It is important to understand that these conceptual metaphors and metonymies are not simply concrete “representations” of the formalisms, or “noise” added on top of\n350 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ formalisms. Indeed, they are constitutive of the very embodied ideas that make math- ematical ideas possible. It is the inferential organization provided by our embodied understanding of “approaching” and “tend- ing to” that is at the core of these mathe- matical ideas. In the case of the “oscillating” function, the moving object is one holistic object, the trigonometric function in the Real plane, constructed metaphorically from an inﬁnite number of discrete real values for x, whose absolute value is progressively smaller. In this case, motion takes place in a speciﬁc manner: moving towards the origin from two opposite sides (i.e., for negative and positive values of x) and always between the values y = 1 and y = −1. As we saw, a variation of this function, f (x) = x sin( 1 x), reveals deep cognitive incompatibil- ities between the dynamic notion of conti- nuity implicit in the example above and the static ε-δ deﬁnition of continuity. But, the question that remains open is, From where do these mathematical objects get motion? What cognitive mechanism is allowing us to conceive static entities such as partial sums or values of functions in dynamic terms? The answer is ﬁctive motion, a fundamental embodied cognitive mecha- nism through which we unconsciously (and effortlessly) conceptualize static entities in dynamic terms, as when we say the road goes along the coast. The road itself doesn’t actu- ally move anywhere. It is simply standing still. But we may conceive it as moving “along the coast.” Fictive motion was ﬁrst studied by Len Talmy (1988, 1996, 2003), via the analysis of linguistic expressions taken from everyday language in which static scenes are described in dynamic terms. The following are linguistic examples of ﬁctive motion: r The fence stops right after the tree. r The border runs along the river. r The US west coast goes all the way down to San Diego. r After crossing the bridge the path goes through the forest and then it reaches the main house. r Unlike Tokyo, in Paris there is no train line that goes around the city. r The Equator passes through many coun- tries. Motion, in all these cases, is ﬁctive, imag- inary, and not real in any literal sense. Not only do these expressions use verbs of action, but they also provide precise descrip- tions of the quality, manner, and form of motion. In all cases of ﬁctive motion there is a “trajector” (the moving agent) and a “landscape” (the space in which the trajec- tor moves). Sometimes the trajector may be a real object (e.g., the road goes; the fence stops), and sometimes it is metaphor- ical and imaginary (e.g., the Equator passes through; the border runs). In ﬁctive motion, real world trajectors don’t move but they have the potential to move or the poten- tial to enact or enable movement (e.g., a car moving along that road). In mathe- matics proper, however, the trajector has always a metaphorical component. That is, the trajector as such can’t be literally capable or incapable of enacting move- ment, because the very nature of the tra- jectory is imagined via metaphor (N´u˜nez, 2003). For example, a point in the Carte- sian plane, which inherits a huge amount of its inferential structure from Euclidean geometry, is an entity that has location (determined by its coordinates) but has no extension. So when we say “point P moves from A to B” we are ascribing motion to a metaphorical entity that only has location. First, as we saw in earlier entities, which have only location (i.e., points) do not exist in the real world, so as such, they do not have the potential to move or not to move in any literal sense. They simply do not exist in the real world. They are metaphorical entities. Second, literally speaking, point A and point B are distinct locations, and in the Cartesian plane no point can change location while preserving its identity since a point’s location is uniquely determined by its coordinates and vice versa. That is, the trajector (point P) cannot preserve its identity throughout the process of motion from A to B, since that would mean that it is changing the very\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 351 properties that are deﬁning it, namely, its coordinates. With this basic understanding of how conceptual metaphor and ﬁctive motion work, we are in a position to see the embod- ied cognitive mechanisms underlying math- ematical expressions such as: r sin 1/x oscillates more and more as x approaches zero r g(x) never goes beyond 1 r If there exists a number L with the prop- erty that f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x gets larger and larger; limx →∞f (x) = L. In these examples ﬁctive motion oper- ates on a network of precise conceptual metaphors (such as NUMBERS ARE LOCA- TIONS IN SPACE, which allows us to con- ceive numbers in terms of spatial posi- tions) that provide the inferential structure required to conceive mathematical func- tions as having motion and directionality. Conceptual metaphor generates a purely imaginary entity in a metaphorical space, and ﬁctive motion makes it a moving tra- jector in this metaphorical space. Thus, the progressively smaller numerical values taken by x which determine numerical values of sin 1/x, are via the conceptual metaphor NUMBERS ARE LOCATIONS IN SPACE con- ceptualized as spatial locations. The now metaphorical spatial locus of the function (i.e., the “line” drawn in the plane) becomes available for ﬁctive motion to act upon. The progressively smaller numerical values taken by x (now metaphorically conceptualized as locations progressively closer to the origin) determine corresponding metaphorical loca- tions in space for sin 1/x. In this imaginary space, via conceptual metaphor and ﬁctive motion now sin 1/x can “oscillate” more and more as x “approaches” zero. In a similar way the inﬁnite precision of real numbers themselves can be conceived as limits of sequences of rational numbers, or as limits of sequences of nested intervals. Because, as we saw, limits have conceptual metaphor and ﬁctive motion built in, we can now see the fundamental role that these embodied mechanisms play in the constitu- tion of the very nature of the real numbers themselves. 5. Are These “Dead” Metaphors? Or Are They Psychologically Real? So far, in this case study we have ana- lyzed some mathematical ideas like limits, continuity, and series through methods in cognitive linguistics that build models of the inferential organization involved in the semantics of linguistic expressions (e.g., con- ceptual metaphor, conceptual metonymy, and ﬁctive motion). But because concep- tual metaphor theory, based mainly on purely linguistic grounds, has made impor- tant claims about human cognition, abstrac- tion, and mental phenomena, some psychol- ogists have rightly questioned the lack of empirical evidence to support the psycho- logical reality of conceptual metaphor. What experimental psychologists want to know is whether there is any cognitive reality in people’s minds when they listen to, utter, or read such metaphorical expressions (see, for example Gibbs, 2006; Gibbs & Colston, 1995; Murphy, 1997). How do we know, for instance, that some of the metaphors we observe in linguistic expressions are not mere “dead metaphors,” expressions that were metaphorical years ago but which have become “lexicalized” in nowadays language? How do we know that these metaphors are the actual result of real-time cognitive activity? Is it the case that people actu- ally operate cognitively with these concep- tual metaphors? And how can we ﬁnd out the answers to such questions? Could it be the case that metaphorical expressions using terms like “approaching” or “getting closer and closer” are simply “dead metaphors,” that is, expressions that once had dynamic spatial content but that now have become separate lexical items, no longer with con- nections with space and motion? Maybe all that we have in the mathematical expres- sions we have examined is simply a story of dead metaphors, with no psychological real- ity whatsoever.\n352 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ Experimental psychologists have tried to answer similar questions regarding everyday linguistic expressions using priming techniques, a well-known experimental paradigm in which subjects are system- atically biased via speciﬁc stimulation involving the source domain in order to evaluate whether they carry the correspond- ing inferences into the target domain. If by priming the source domain of the metaphor one gets systematic variation in the infer- ences made in the target domain, then one could conclude that individuals do reason metaphorically, or otherwise they would not be sensitive to the priming. In this chapter, however, in order to address the question of the psychological reality of the conceptual metaphors involved, I will use a differ- ent form of empirical analysis: real time gesture–speech–thought co-production. As we will see, the study of human gesture pro- vides embodied convergent evidence of the psychological reality of many conceptual mappings, metaphorical, metonymical and others. Gesture studies, via a detailed investigation of real-time cognitive pro- duction, bodily motion (mainly hands and arms), and voice inﬂection, show that the conceptual metaphors and ﬁctive motion involved in the mathematical ideas analyzed above, far from being dead, do have a real-time and very embodied psychological reality. Gesture as Cognition In the study of the human mind, gestures have been left out of the picture for a very long time. They constitute the forgot- ten dimension of thought and language. In Chomskian linguistics, for instance, where language has been seen mainly in terms of abstract grammar, formalisms, and syntac- tic combinatorics, there was simply no room for “bodily production” such as gesture. In mainstream experimental psychology ges- tures were left out, among others, because being produced in a spontaneous manner, it was very hard to operationally deﬁne them, making rigorous experimental obser- vation on them extremely difﬁcult. In main- stream cognitive science, which in its origins was heavily inﬂuenced by classic “disembod- ied” artiﬁcial intelligence, there was simply no room for gestures either. Cognitive sci- ence and artiﬁcial intelligence were heav- ily inﬂuenced by the information-processing paradigm and what was taken to be essential in any cognitive activity was a set of body- less abstract rules and the manipulation of physical symbols governing the processing of information. In all these cases, gestures were completely ignored and left out of the pic- ture that deﬁned what constituted genuine subject matters for the study of the mind. At best gestures were considered as a kind of epiphenomenon, secondary to other more important and better-deﬁned phenomena. But in the last decade or so, the ﬁeld of gesture studies has moved forward dramat- ically, thanks to the work of pioneers such as Kendon (1980, 2004), McNeill (1992, in press), Goldin-Meadow (2003), and many others. Research in a variety of areas, from child development, to neuropsychology, to linguistics, and to anthropology, has shown the intimate link between oral and gestural production. Finding after ﬁnding has con- ﬁrmed that gestures are often produced in synchronicity with speech, that they develop in close relation with speech, and that brain injuries affecting speech production also affect gesture production. The following is an abbreviated list of sources of evidence supporting (1) the view that speech and ges- ture are in reality two facets of the same cog- nitive linguistic reality, and (2) the embodied approach for understanding language, con- ceptual systems, and high-level cognition: 1. Universality: Speech-accompanying ge- sture is a cross-cultural universal (McNeill, 1992; N´u˜nez & Sweetser, 2001, 2006; Iverson & Thelen, 1999; Kita & Essegbey, 2001). 2. Largely unconscious production: Ges- tures are less monitored than speech, and they are to a great extent uncon- scious. Speakers are often unaware that they are gesturing at all (McNeill, 1992). 3. Speech–gesture synchronicity: Gestures are co-produced with speech, in co- timing patterns which are speciﬁc to a given language (McNeill, 1992).\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 353 4. Gesture production with no visible interlocutor: Gestures can be produced without the presence of interlocutors, e.g., people gesture while talking on the telephone, and in monologues; con- genitally blind subjects gesture as well (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 1998). 5. Speech–gesture co-processing: Stutter- ers stutter in gesture too, and impeding hand gestures interrupts speech produc- tion (Mayberry & Jaques, 2000). 6. Speech–gesture development: Gesture and speech development are closely linked (Bates & Dick, 2002; Goldin- Meadow 2003; Iverson & Thelen, 1999). 7. Speech–gesture complementarity: Ges- ture can provide complementary (as well as overlapping) content to speech content. Speakers synthesize and subse- quently cannot distinguish information taken from the two channels (Kendon, 2000). 8. Gestures and abstract metaphorical thinking: Linguistic metaphorical map- pings are paralleled systematically in gesture (Cienki, 1998; McNeill, 1992; Sweetser, 1998; N´u˜nez, 2003; N´u˜nez & Sweetser, 2001, 2006). In all these studies, a careful analysis of important parameters of gestures such as hand shapes, hand and arm positions, palm orientation, type of movements, tra- jectories, manner, and speed, as well as a careful examination of timing, indexing properties, levels of iconicity, and the cou- pling with environmental features, give deep insight into human thought.3 Among many properties, gestures usually have three well- deﬁned phases, called preparation, stroke, and retraction (McNeill, 1992). The stroke is in general the fastest part of the ges- ture’s motion, and it tends to be highly synchronized with speech accentuation and semantic content. The preparation phase is the motion that precedes the stroke (usually slower), and the retraction is the motion that takes place after the stroke has been produced (usually slower as well), when the hand goes back to a resting position or to whatever activity it was engaged in. Figure 19.4. A professor of mathematics teaching a university level class on convergence of sequences of real numbers. Here he is referring to a case in which the numbers of a sequence “oscillate.” With these tools from gesture studies and cognition, we can now analyze mathemati- cal expressions like the ones we saw before, but this time focusing on the gesture produc- tion of the speaker (in this case a mathemati- cian teaching a university level mathematics course). The following gestures have been recorded during upper division mathemat- ics classes at a major university in California. Keep in mind that these gestures are abstract (metaphorical) in nature, in the sense that the entities that are indexed with the vari- ous hand shapes – like points and numbers – are purely imaginary entities. Figure 19.4 shows a professor of math- ematics teaching theorems about conver- gence of sequences of real numbers. In this particular situation, he is talking about a case in which the values of an inﬁnite sequence do not get closer and closer to a single value as n increases, but “oscillate” between two ﬁxed values. His right hand, with the palm towards his left, has a hand shape called baby O in American Sign Language and in ges- ture studies, where the index ﬁnger and the thumb are touching and are slightly bent while the other three ﬁngers are fully bent. In this gesture the touching tip of the index and the thumb is metaphorically indexing a metonymical value standing for the values in the sequence as n increases (it is almost\n354 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ (a) (c) (e) (f) (d) (b) Figure 19.5. A professor of mathematics in a university level class talking about an unbounded monotone sequence “going in one direction” (a through e) and which “takes off to inﬁnity” (f ). as if the subject is carefully holding a very tiny object with those two ﬁngers). Holding that ﬁxed hand shape, he moves his right arm horizontally back and forth while he says “oscillating.” Hands and arms are essential body parts involved in gesturing. But often it is also the entire body that participates in enacting the inferential structure of an idea. In the fol- lowing example (Figure 19.5), a professor of mathematics is teaching a course involving notions of calculus. In this scene, he is talk- ing about some particular theorems regard- ing monotone sequences. As he is talking about an unbounded monotone sequence, he is referring to the important property of “going in one direction” (i.e., taking increasingly large\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 355 (a) (b) (c) Figure 19.6. A professor of mathematics in a university level class talking about a constant sequence. values). As he says this he is producing iter- ative unfolding circles with his right hand and at the same time he is walking front- ward, accelerating at each step (Figure 19.5a through 19.5e). His right hand, with the palm toward his chest, displays a shape called tapered O (thumb relatively extended and touching the upper part of an extended index bent in right angle, like the other ﬁn- gers), which he keeps in a relatively ﬁxed position while doing the iteration circular movement. A few milliseconds later he com- pletes the sentence by saying “it takes off to inﬁnity” at the very moment when his right arm is fully extended and his hand shape has shifted to an extended shape called B spread with a fully (almost over) extension, and the tips of the ﬁngers pointing frontward, slightly at eye-level. Sometimes, when the sequence exhibits a peculiar property, hand shapes adopt spe- ciﬁc forms that match the meaning of those properties. In Figure 19.6, we see the same professor talking this time about a situation where the sequence is constant. His domi- nant hand (the right one, with which he has been writing on the board) curls back, his elbow is bent in 90 degrees and his wrist is maximally bent with the palm oriented down. His ﬁngers are also bent pointing downward (Figure 19.6a). Then while keep- ing that hand shape he extends his elbow (and wrist) producing a small frontward (and slightly downward) motion with his right hand. In the meantime, his left hand, with\n356 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ palm toward right, raises slowly, forming a ﬁve hand shape (Figure 19.6b). As he says the word “constant”, he abruptly stops the forward motion with his right hand mark- ing a location situated a couple of inches in front of his open ﬁve left hand (Figure 19.6c). While keeping his left hand totally ﬁxed and holding the same “ﬁve” hand shape, he iterates a couple of times the same front- ward movement with his right hand always stopping sharply at the same location, just a few inches from the open palm of his left hand. These abruptly stopped movements performed with the curled hand shape while referring to a constant sequence sharply con- trast with the smooth open ended fully extended arm, hand, and ﬁngers of the previous example produced when refer- ring to an unbounded monotone sequence (Figure 19.5). It is important to mention that in these three cases the blackboard is full of math- ematical expressions containing formalisms like the ones we saw in section 4 (e.g., formalisms, with universal and existential quantiﬁers, which have no indication or ref- erence to motion). The gestures (and the linguistic expressions used), however, tell us a very different conceptual story. In these examples, these mathematicians are refer- ring to fundamental dynamic aspects of the mathematical ideas they are talking (and thinking) about. In the ﬁrst example, the oscillating gesture match – and it is pro- duced synchronically with – the linguistic expressions used. In the second example, the unfolding iterative circular gesture matches the inferential organization of the iteration involved in the monotone sequence, and the entire body moves forward as the sequence unfolds. Since the sequence is unbounded, it “takes off to inﬁnity,” an idea which is pre- cisely characterized in a synchronous way with the full frontal extension of the arm and the hand. That motion contrasts with the one in the third example, where a curled shaped hand moves slightly forward but hits repeatedly the same location, never being able to go further. We can conclude from these examples that: r First, gestures provide converging evi- dence for the psychological and embod- ied reality of the linguistic expressions analyzed with classic techniques in cog- nitive linguistics, such as metaphor and ﬁctive motion analysis. In these cases ges- ture analysis shows that the metaphorical expressions we saw earlier are not cases of dead metaphors. The above gestures show that the dynamism involved in these ideas has full psychological and cognitive reality, which is enacted in real time while speaking and thinking in an instructional context. r Second, these gestures show that the fundamental dynamic contents involving inﬁnite sequences, limits, continuity, and so on, are in fact constitutive of the infer- ential structure of these ideas. Formal lan- guage in mathematics, however, is not as rich as everyday language and cannot cap- ture the full complexity of the inferen- tial structure of mathematical ideas. It is the job of the cognitive science of math- ematics to characterize the full richness of mathematical ideas (it is not the job of mathematics itself). The Moral The main point of our case study was to show that even the most abstract concep- tual system we can think of, mathematics(!), is ultimately embodied in the nature of our bodies, language, and cognition. Con- ceptual metaphor and ﬁctive motion, being extremely fast, highly efﬁcient, and effort- less cognitive mechanisms that preserve inferences, play a fundamental role in bring- ing many mathematical concepts into being. We analyzed several cases involving dynamic language in mathematics, in domains in which, according to formal deﬁnitions and axioms in mathematics, no motion was sup- posed to exist at all. Via the study of gestures, we were able to see that the conceptual metaphors underlying the lin- guistic expressions were not simply cases of “dead” metaphorical expressions. Ges- ture studies provide real-time convergent\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 357 evidence supporting the psychological and cognitive reality of the embodiment of mathematical ideas, and their inferential organization. Building on gestures studies we were able to tell that the above math- ematics professors, not only were using metaphorical linguistic expressions, but that they were in fact, in real time, thinking dynamically! 6. Philosophical Implications From the work in the cognitive science of mathematics that we have been analyz- ing throughout this chapter, it follows that mathematics is a human enterprise. Mathe- matics is a technical conceptual system that makes use of the same conceptual mech- anisms of thought as in other intellectual domains (e.g., conceptual metaphor, ﬁctive motion), which shows a remarkable opti- mal use of a human’s limited and highly constrained biological resources. To under- stand the inferential organization that makes mathematics what it is, is to understand how the human mind uses everyday cogni- tive mechanisms in very special and sophis- ticated ways. Mathematical Idea Analysis is a tool that can serve this purpose. Results in the cognitive science of math- ematics, such as the ones analyzed here, have an immediate consequence for the philosophy of mathematics. It provides a new answer for what is perhaps the most intriguing philosophical question involv- ing mathematics: What is the nature of mathematics? The answer can be summa- rized as follows: r Mathematics, as we know it or can know it, exists by virtue of the embodied mind. r All mathematical content resides in embodied mathematical ideas. r A large number of the most basic, as well as the most sophisticated, mathematical ideas are metaphorical in nature. Results in the cognitive science of mathematics also have another immediate consequence: it disconﬁrms the Romance of Mathematics mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. From a scientiﬁc perspective, there is no way to know whether there are objectively existing, external, mathematical entities or mathematical truths. Debating over such issues is a matter of faith, not science. However, we can empirically show that human mathematics is embodied, that is, that it is grounded in bodily experience in the world and that is primarily a matter of mathematical ideas, which are signiﬁ- cantly metaphorical in nature. Mathematics is not purely literal; it is an imaginative, profoundly metaphorical enterprise, where the metaphorizing is, of course, generated, realized, and sustained by humans. The metaphorizing doesn’t pre-exist humans and it is not independent of them. Therefore, Human mathematics is not structured after objectively pre-existing, external timeless mathematical entities or eternal mathemat- ical truths. These conclusions ought not to be taken as a conﬁrmation that mathematics is then merely a matter of social conventions, as it is often argued by radical social construc- tivists and post-modernists. In fact, the work described in this chapter also disconﬁrms such views: Mathematics is not a matter of pure social conventions. Being embod- ied, mathematics uses general mechanisms of embodied cognition and is grounded in experience in the world, and therefore, it is not arbitrary. It is highly constrained by the peculiarities of the human brain and body, and the linguistic and cultural practices that they sustain and can afford. Mathematics, therefore, is not purely subjective; is not a matter of mere social agreement; and it is not purely historically and culturally contingent (although historical and cultural factors do enter into mathematics in many important ways. For details, see Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000, chap. 15). The crucial role that metaphor plays in making mathematics what it is, also raises issues regarding ontology and truth. Two central questions driving much of the philosophy of mathematics of the 19th and 20th centuries have been: What are mathe- matical objects? And, What is mathematical\n358 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ truth? The most common contemporary answers to these questions come from those who believe in the romance of mathematics, as well as from scholars who defend the idea that mathematics must have “secure” foun- dations which, in themselves, are mathe- matical entities (e.g., Set-theoretic entities). Adherents of the former and many defend- ers of the latter thus provide similar answers: r Mathematical objects are real; they are objective entities existing independently of human beings. r Mathematical truths are objective truths of the universe. But, as we have seen such answers are refuted by results in the cognitive science of mathematics such as the mathematical idea analysis of limits and continuity of func- tions. From this work, we see that the ontol- ogy of mathematics is inseparable from the human imagination and the mechanisms – such as conceptual metaphor – that make it possible. Mathematical objects are embod- ied concepts – that is, they are ideas that are ultimately grounded in human experi- ence and put together via normal human conceptual mechanisms, such as concep- tual metaphors and ﬁctive motion. And in what concerns Truth, mathematical truth is like any other truth. A statement is true if our embodied understanding of the state- ment accords with our embodied under- standing of the subject matter and the situa- tion at hand. Truth, including mathematical truth, is thus dependent on embodied human cognition (see Lakoff & Johnson, 1999, chaps. 6–8; N´u˜nez, 1995, 2008; N´u˜nez & Sweetser, 2006). It comes out of the infer- ential organization provided by mechanisms such as conceptual metaphor, which charac- terize speciﬁc entailments via precise map- pings from the source domain to the target domain. Finally, another important issue covered in this chapter is that of formalism. For- malist mathematicians often dismiss “intu- ition,” on the grounds that it is vague and often mathematically incorrect. It is impor- tant to contrast mathematical ideas, as we have been discussing them, with “vague intu- itions.” The cognitive science of mathemat- ics offers a way for studying the precise structure of mathematical ideas and their inferential organization. And, as we have seen, the “intuitively” dynamic notions asso- ciated to limits and continuity are not vague intuitions. Mathematical idea analysis stud- ies the structure and grounding of many of the most central ideas in all mathemat- ics. The precise characterizations given of metaphorical mappings reveal real, stable, and precise conceptual structure. They make as precise as it is possible in contemporary cognitive science what is left vague in the practice of formal mathematics. A “formalization” of a subject matter in terms of set theory often hides the concep- tual structure of that subject matter. Math- ematical idea analysis begins to make that conceptual structure precise. What it does is to make explicit what is implicit in the prac- tice of formal mathematics: It characterizes in precise cognitive terms the mathematical ideas in the cognitive unconscious that go unformalized and undescribed when a for- malization of conscious mathematical ideas is done. This includes the bodily ground- ing of mathematical ideas and a character- ization of the metaphors, blends, and other mechanisms of the mind that give mathe- matical thought an abstract character. What this implies is that pure formalization does not do what many scholars claim for it. It does not formulate otherwise vague ideas in a rigorous fashion. Instead, it uses metaphor to replace certain ideas with other ideas – ideas for which there is a well-understood symbolization and method of calculation. It is important to bear in mind what does and does not occur when some domain of math- ematics is “formalized”: 1. The original ideas are not kept; they are replaced metaphorically by other ideas: For instance, in the case of con- tinuity of functions, metaphors involv- ing dynamic and holistic entities (e.g., a function “oscillating”) are replaced by static and discrete ones (as they are char- acterized by the idea of “preservation of\nCONCEPTUAL METAPHOR, HUMAN COGNITION, AND THE NATURE OF MATHEMATICS 359 closeness,” which is formalized through the use of universal and existential quan- tiﬁers). 2. The formalization is not an abstract generalization over the original ideas: For example, we saw that the function f (x) = x sin 1/x is ε-δ continuous, but NOT naturally continuous. The ε-δ for- malization thus doesn’t capture the full meaning of the original ideas implicit in natural continuity. 3. The original ideas receive no math- ematical idea analysis under the formalization: Motion and holistic properties, for instance, are simply left out of the formalizations of limits and continuity. 4. The ideas of set theory and formal logic receive no mathematical idea analysis under the formalization: The formal lan- guage is taken for granted. For example, the ε-δ formalization of continuity does not provide a cognitive semantic analy- sis of the existential and universal quan- tiﬁers it uses. They are taken as given. In sum, Conceptual metaphor plays a funda- mental role in originating and sustaining the very mathematics we know. From the work George Lakoff and I have done in the cogni- tive science of mathematics and the study of conceptual metaphor underlying mathemat- ical ideas, thus emerges a human embodied view of the nature of mathematics (Lakoff & N´u˜nez, 2000, p. 377): r Mathematics is a natural part of being human. It arises from our bodies, our brains, and our everyday experiences in the world. Cultures everywhere have some form of mathematics. r There is nothing mysterious, mystical, magical, or transcendent about mathe- matics. It is an important subject matter for scientiﬁc study. It is a consequence of human evolutionary history, neurobi- ology, cognitive capacities, and culture. r Mathematics is one of the greatest prod- ucts of the collective human imagination. It has been constructed jointly by millions of dedicated people over more than two thousand years, and is maintained by hun- dreds of thousands of scholars, teachers, and people who use it every day. r Mathematics is a system of human con- cepts that makes extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition. It is special in that it is stable, precise, gen- eralizable, symbolizable, calculable, con- sistent within each of its subject mat- ters, universally available, and effective for precisely conceptualizing a large num- ber of aspects of the world as we experi- ence it. r The effectiveness of mathematics in the world is a tribute to evolution and to cul- ture. Evolution has shaped our bodies and brains so that we have inherited neural capacities for the basics of number and for primitive spatial relations. Culture has made it possible for millions of astute observers of nature, through millennia of trial and error, to develop and pass on more and more sophisticated mathemat- ical tools – tools shaped to describe what they have observed. There is no mystery about the effectiveness of mathematics for characterizing the world as we experi- ence it: That effectiveness results from a combination of mathematical knowledge and connectedness to the world. The con- nection between mathematical ideas and the world as human beings experience it occurs within human minds. It is human beings who have created logarithmic spi- rals and fractals and who can “see” log- arithmic spirals in snails and fractals in palm leaves. r In the minds of those millions who have developed and sustained mathematics, conceptions of mathematics have been devised to ﬁt the world as perceived and conceptualized. This is possible because concepts like change, proportion, size, rotation, probability, recurrence, itera- tion, and hundreds of others are both everyday ideas and ideas that have been mathematicized. The mathematization of ordinary human ideas is an ordinary human enterprise. r Through the development of writing sys- tems over millennia, culture has made\n360 RAFAEL N ´U ˜NEZ possible the notational systems of math- ematics. Because human conceptual sys- tems are capable of conceptual preci- sion and symbolization, mathematics has been able to develop systems of pre- cise calculation and proof. Through the use of discretization metaphors, more and more mathematical ideas become precisely symbolizable and calculable. It is the human capacity for conceptual metaphor that makes possible the precise mathematization and sometimes even the arithmetization of everyday concepts – concepts like collections, dimensions, symmetry, causal dependence and inde- pendence, and many more. r Everything in mathematics is comprehen- sible – at least in principle. Since it makes use of general human conceptual capaci- ties, its conceptual structure can be ana- lyzed and taught in meaningful terms. r We have learned from the study of the mind that human intelligence is multi- faceted and that many forms of intelli- gence are vital to human culture. Mathe- matical intelligence is one of them – not greater or lesser than musical intelligence, artistic intelligence, literary intelligence, emotional and interpersonal intelli- gence, and so on. r Mathematics is creative and open- ended. By virtue of the use of concep- tual metaphors and conceptual blends, present mathematics can be extended to create new forms by importing struc- ture from one branch to another and by fusing mathematical ideas from different branches. r Human conceptual systems are not monolithic. They allow alternative ver- sions of concepts and multiple metaphor- ical perspectives of many (though by no means all!) important aspects of our lives. Mathematics is every bit as conceptually rich as any other part of the human con- ceptual system. Moreover, mathematics allows for alternative visions and versions of concepts. There is not one notion of inﬁnity but many, not one formal logic but tens of thousands, not one concept of number but a rich variety of alterna- tives, not one set theory or geometry or statistics but a wide range of them – all mathematics! r Mathematics is a magniﬁcent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diver- sity, and importance of human ideas. It is a marvelous testament to what the ordinary embodied human mind is capable of – when multiplied by the creative efforts of millions over millennia. r Human beings have been responsible for the creation of mathematics, and we remain responsible for maintaining and extending it.

Much of their suspicion stems from an objectivist epistemology. In the words of one recent commentator: “Metaphors are falsehoods. If they were literally true, they wouldn’t be metaphors.” On this view, metaphors must ultimately be translated into the facts for which they stand lest they lead to con- fusion and error.1 Some mainstream legal theorists concede that metaphor is useful because it is vivid and evocative but worry that its poetic and subjective qualities will compromise clarity and comprehensibility.2 The inﬂuential antiformalists of the early twentieth century – the Legal Realists and their predecessors – were leery of metaphor because they identiﬁed it with the mis- leading conceptualism of legal formalism.3 Famously, Justice Cardozo observed that: “Metaphors in law are to be narrowly ∗ Steven L. Winter is the Walter S. Gibbs Professor of Constitutional Law at Wayne State University Law School. watched, for though starting as devices to liberate thought, they end often by enslaving it.”4 Conventional legal reasoning, in con- trast, strives to reduce a complex problem to a policy, principle, propositional rule, or some other set of necessary and sufﬁcient criteria. In theory, these deﬁnitional criteria will allow professionals to delineate legal cat- egories with greater precision, draw appro- priate distinctions, and then make correct decisions. This chapter examines a particularly important and surprisingly intractable set of legal problems for which the conventional approach fails utterly: questions of govern- mental and ofﬁcial accountability. Conven- tional legal analysis fails here (and elsewhere, too) because it assumes that concepts are literal, that signiﬁcation is arbitrary, and that meaning is intentional and truth- conditional. But this traditional methodol- ogy proves hopelessly inadequate to a social conception like “the state,” which cannot be reduced to a set of objectiﬁable crite- ria. Instead, it leaves lawyers and judges struggling in vain to parse ﬁgurative lan- guage as if it were literal or to sound 363\n364 STEVEN L. WINTER the depths of an unfathomable legislative subjectivity. For more than seven centuries, Anglo- American legislators and judges have turned to a legal metaphor – “under color of ofﬁce” and its variants – to make sense of the issues raised by cases of ofﬁcial accountabil- ity. In this chapter, I use the cognitive theory of metaphor both to illuminate this previ- ously neglected legal history and to uncover important aspects of legal reasoning as it has actually been performed by ﬂesh-and- blood practitioners. But the import of this analysis is more general: It illustrates, in a real-world, high-stakes context, some of the most profound implications of the theory of metaphorical reason. Where conventional epistemologies assume either the determi- nacy of objectivist logic or the arbitrari- ness of social coherence theory, the actual, historical operations of metaphorical reason reveal the imaginative, yet systematic nature of human rationality. Where conventional theories of meaning see (or fear) unbridled subjectivity, the empirical data demonstrate the ways in which an imaginative human rationality is constrained by the embodied, socially situated nature of our cognitive pro- cesses. Metaphor is both a basic dimen- sion of human reason and an indispensable tool of legal thought: For, as we shall see, it is only by metaphor that we are able to express signiﬁcant aspects of our social reality – aspects that are otherwise deval- ued, distorted, or eliminated by more con- ventional, reductive approaches to human reasoning. Too Much or Too Little All questions of governmental and ofﬁcial accountability presuppose that one can reli- ably identify when an action is that of a gov- ernmental entity or ofﬁcial. But this is much more difﬁcult than it may seem. Because every ofﬁcial is also a private individual, it is often unclear when that person has acted as an ofﬁcial and when he or she has acted in their private capacity. Beyond this obvi- ous problem of role ambiguity, however, lies the more profound problem that the state as an entity is an entirely conceptual con- struct. There are many legal contexts in which no one doubts the ofﬁcial character of the primary legal actors, but the question nevertheless remains whether their actions should be imputed to the governmental entity that employs them: Questions of what counts as state action subject to the pro- scriptions of the Fourteenth Amendment,5 governmental immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment,6 and municipal liability under the 1871 Civil Rights Act,7 to name just a few, all turn on the the- ory by which one determines whether the agents’ acts are considered to be those of the state. Properly understood, the state is the amalgamation of the actions of a large num- ber of actual human beings acting in partic- ular social roles. But while this pragmatist understanding of the state is correct, it is – as Justice Frankfurter observed – also the source of much difﬁculty: “Since the state . . . can only act through functionaries, the ques- tion naturally arises what functionaries, act- ing under what circumstances, are to be deemed the state. . . . The problem is beset with inherent difﬁculties and not unnatu- rally has had a ﬂuctuating history in the deci- sions of the Court.”8 The problem “who or what is the state?” is a problem of social meaning. Without the concept “state” there would only be groups of similarly clad thugs impinging on our autonomy or protecting us (at a price, no doubt) from other such groups. In this sense, the state is an imagi- native social product over and above its per- sonnel and its other material manifestations. The state exists only because we conceptu- alize it as such.9 For the average citizen of a modern democracy who has never experienced a radical change of regime, the state seems indisputably real. In periods of political instability, however, the imaginative, socially constructed nature of the state is cast in bas- relief. Consider, for example, the effect of the Nazi occupation of France during World War II and the formation of a collaborationist government at Vichy:\nWHAT IS THE “COLOR” OF LAW? 365 [It] meant that suddenly each citizen was thrust into a situation where he had to “argue within himself over the social pact and reconstitute a state by choice” . . . Where before there had been habitual alle- giance, now there was necessarily a deliber- ate decision for or against the Vichy regime. The Occupation brought to the foreground a truth usually ignored: the state rests upon nothing other than the collective effect of choices made by individuals.10 But even in more ordinary circumstances when there is only a single government widely accepted as legitimate, the socially constructed nature of the state means that there is no clear-cut way to determine whether it is a governmental entity that has acted. For just as the citizens can withhold their consent from an authority they view as illegitimate, a legal system can withhold its authorization from the acts of its ofﬁcials. When it does, the resulting doctrinal difﬁ- culties are monumental: Is an illegal act by a state ofﬁcial state action? If the answer to that question is “yes” (as it is), is that act shielded by the state’s sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment? And if the answer to the latter question is “no” (as, in fact, it is), then how does one resolve the contradiction between these two inconsis- tent characterizations? It might seem that the obvious solution to the problem is to identify the state with only those who act pursuant to the spe- ciﬁc authorization of its positive law. But this position – which I refer to as “the reductive approach” – obliterates much of what is supposed to be accomplished by the commitment to governmental account- ability represented by the ideal of “a gov- ernment of laws and not of men.”11 In a simplistic sense, the reductive view seems to ﬁt well with the rule-of-law ideal. A gov- ernmental ofﬁcer who fails to comply with the rules specifying her ofﬁcial conduct is no longer viewed as acting for the state and is instead treated as any other wrongdoer. But, the reductive approach quickly proves inco- herent because there is no government apart from the men (and women) who instan- tiate it. This incoherence becomes man- ifest under either of two circumstances: (1) when the issue is the enforcement of constitutional constraints on actions that are peculiarly governmental – the Eleventh Amendment problem, for example; or (2) when the system is designed to invoke legal constraints that are deﬁned in terms of ofﬁcial action.12 Worse yet, the search for reliable objec- tiﬁed criteria either proves too much or too little.13 If state action is identiﬁed with state permission, then every actor – public and private, ofﬁcial and unofﬁcial – is always act- ing as the state.14 Conversely, if state action is reduced to direct authorization by pos- itive law, then, strictly speaking, no puta- tively illegal act could be attributed to the state until its highest court had upheld it against legal challenge.15 Here, then, is a case where the rationalist tools of standard legal analysis lead to confusion rather than clarity. It is noteworthy, therefore, that histor- ically the Anglo-American legal tradition relied on the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor to mediate the application of legal restrictions on the exercise of state power. Remarkably complex in structure, the expression is actu- ally premised on two different metaphorical conceptions – one embodied, the other cul- turally contingent. Notwithstanding these differences in origin and structure, both metaphorical concepts share the connota- tion of action that presents a deceptive appearance. More importantly, we will see how this meaning-rich metaphor represents a sophisticated response to the conceptual problems raised by cases of ofﬁcial miscon- duct – a response that is not possible on more conventional legal reasoning. Sheriffs, Sureties, and the “Colour of Their Ofﬁce” Today, the difﬁculties caused by the con- structive nature of the state arise most fre- quently in the context of constitutional litigation under section 1983, the 1871 Civil Rights Act that provides redress for constitutional violations committed “under color of” state law.16 But the underlying\n366 STEVEN L. WINTER conceptual problem was familiar to the com- mon law, which for centuries used the “color of ofﬁce” concept to mediate appropriate legal controls over sheriffs and other ofﬁ- cers. The phrase “Colour of his Ofﬁce” ﬁrst appeared in an English statute of 1275 that prohibited seizures of property without a warrant or other proper authority.17 As Sir Edward Coke explained in his annotation of the statute: Colore ofﬁcii is ever taken in malam partem, as virtute ofﬁcii is taken in bonam: And therefore this implyeth a seisure unduly made against law. And he may doe it colore ofﬁcii in two manner of wayes: Either when he hath no warrant, or when he hath a warrant, and doth not persue it.18 A statute of 1444 prohibited sheriffs and their ofﬁcers from taking “under color of their ofﬁce” any “thing . . . to their use, proﬁt, or avail, of any person by them . . . to be arrested or attached, nor of none other for them, for the omitting of any arrest or attachment” or for “mainprise, letting to bail, or eschewing any ease or favour to any such person so arrested.” The statute was aimed at extortion and other abuses of the bail bond process by local sheriffs, who would release debtors upon the posting of an indemniﬁca- tion bond in an amount exceeding the orig- inal debt. The statute regulated who was eligible for bail and expressly excepted from bail those arrested upon execution for debt. It further speciﬁed the form for bail bonds and provided that “if any of the said sheriffs . . . take any obligation in other form by colour of their ofﬁces, that it shall be void.”19 During the ﬁnal years of the reign of Henry VIII, a yeoman by the name of Thomas Maningham fell in arrears with his ﬁshmonger, Thomas Palley, in the amount of 200 marks sterling. On May 18, 1545, Pal- ley sued out a writ in execution of the debt, which Maningham had previously confessed in court. The writ was addressed to the sher- iff of the county of Bedford, Lewis Dive, who was directed to seize all of Maningham’s property and to imprison Maningham until he had fully satisﬁed his debt to Palley. Dive executed the writ, seizing the property, and arresting Maningham. Maningham’s brother John, however, obtained bail for him. John Maningham endorsed and gave to Dive a surety bond in the amount of £40 that agreed to indemnify and “keep, without damage, the said sheriff against our Lord the King, and one Thomas Palley.”20 Dive later sued John Maningham on the bond. Maningham’s defense was that the bond was void under the statute. In response, Dive argued that the bond was not covered by the statute and, therefore, not covered by the provision rendering void any noncon- forming obligation. On this logic, the bond was like any contract enforceable at com- mon law.* The court ruled that the statute applied, held the bond void, and rendered judgment for the defendant John Maning- ham. In rejecting Dive’s claim, the court made two arguments. First, it reasoned that the statute had to be interpreted in light of the mischief it sought to remedy. Accordingly, it held that the clauses which prescribed the form of all bonds and which made all nonconforming bonds void were intended to apply as well to bonds entered into for non- bailable offenses: “so that if the sheriffs or other ofﬁcers will let prisoners at large, they must do it at their peril, for by this statute their safe conduct, that is to say, the obliga- tions to save them harmless, is cut off and destroyed (pp. 107–108).” Second, and more important for our purposes, the court rea- soned that: [I]f the obligation is not void for this cause, it seems to me that (if it is taken in other form than the statute limits) these words, viz. colore ofﬁcii, will make it void for it is to be considered that Thomas Maning- ham . . . was in execution under the cus- tody of the plaintiff, not as Lewis Dive, but * Thus, Dive argued that “here Thomas Maningham was in upon execution, and was one of those con- tained in the exception, and the letting him go at large is an escape, and so is out of the intent of the statute and is meerly [sic] at the common law, in which case the obligation stands at common law and is good (pp. 100–101).”\nWHAT IS THE “COLOR” OF LAW? 367 as sheriff, for the writ to take Thomas Man- ingham was directed to him as sheriff, and so as ofﬁcer he had the custody of him, then when he took the obligation, he took it as ofﬁcer, but he took it unduly, for he was not bailable, but yet he took it as sheriff, ergo he took it colore ofﬁcii sui; for this word colore ofﬁcii sui is always taken in malam partem, and signiﬁes an act badly done under countenance of an ofﬁce, and it bears a dissembling visage of duty, and is properly called extortion. As if an ofﬁcer will take more for his fees than he ought, this is done colore ofﬁcii sui, but yet it is not part of his ofﬁce, and it is called extor- tion, which is no other than robbery, but it is more odious than robbery, for robbery is apparent, and always hath the counte- nance of vice, but extortion, being equally as great a vice as robbery, carries the mask of virtue, and is more difﬁcult to be tried or discerned, and consequently more odious than robbery. Wherefore here inasmuch as the obligation was made for the deliverance of Thomas Maningham, who was in the custody of the plaintiff as ofﬁcer, it cannot be denied but that he took the obligation for his deliverance colore ofﬁcii, although it was not virtute ofﬁcii sui. (p. 108) Note the court’s conspicuous difﬁculty with the problem of role ambiguity. It is all the more remarkable because the issue before it seems so simple and straightfor- ward. The sheriff, after all, had done pre- cisely what the statute prohibited. What appears to have troubled the court was the fact that, as quoted above, the clause ren- dering the obligation void appeared to be addressed to sheriffs acting in their ofﬁcial capacity.* Yet, on the reductive approach, an unauthorized or illegal act is not a gen- uine act of the state itself. Indeed, the statute at issue in Dive opened with the King’s disavowal of “the great perjury, extor- tion, and oppression” committed by his sher- iffs and their deputies.21 Nevertheless, the court concluded that Dive had acted in his ofﬁcial capacity even though his actions * This is what makes sense of Dive’s claim that the debt was outside the statute: If the obligation was not taken in his ofﬁcial capacity, then it was just a contract between two private parties no different than any other obligation at common law. were plainly outside his rightful authority: “[W]hen he took the obligation, he took it as ofﬁcer, but he took it unduly, for he was not bailable, but yet he took it as sheriff, ergo he took it colore ofﬁcii sui.” In this way, the court addressed the duplicitous quality of the sheriff’s actions “badly done under countenance of an ofﬁce, and [bearing] a dis- sembling visage of duty.” As Maningham’s counsel argued, “colore ofﬁcii implies that the thing is under pretence of ofﬁce, but not duly, and the ofﬁce is no more than a cloak to deceit, and the thing is grounded upon vice, and the ofﬁce is as a shadow thereto (p. 102).” Nineteenth-century American courts faced similar problems of role ambiguity. The issue arose with some frequency in suits alleging that, in executing a writ of attachment, the sheriff had in fact seized goods belonging to the wrong person. Because sheriffs were likely to be people of limited means, a party injured by the sheriff’s unlawful act would seek recovery against the sureties on the ofﬁcer’s bond faithfully to perform the duties of his ofﬁce. If the sheriff’s act were treated as the unlawful act of a private actor, the injured party could not recover against the sureties because, as some courts reasoned, “there being no authority, there is no ofﬁce, nothing ofﬁcial.”22 Thus, from the sureties’ perspective, a fully reductive analysis would have ensured a “heads I win, tails you lose” situation: “The argument, if sound, would preclude a recovery in any case against the sureties. If an authority could be shown, their defence would be complete; if there was none, the act would be extra ofﬁcial, and not within the scope of their undertaking.”23 Accord- ingly, most courts recognized that the bond would be forfeited and the sureties liable in cases of nonfeasance or misfeasance. Though some drew the line at cases of malfea- sance, other less reductive courts recog- nized that wrongs committed under a claim of authority were colore ofﬁcii and retained their ofﬁcial character. As one court rea- soned, when a sheriff executed a writ to seize the goods from the wrong person, he\n368 STEVEN L. WINTER nevertheless “does this in his character of sheriff, colore ofﬁcii, and not as a naked tres- passer without color of authority.”24 Accord- ingly, the majority rule – later adopted by the Supreme Court for federal ofﬁcers – gave the injured party recourse against the sureties in cases of malfeasance such as a wrongful attachment.25 In the twentieth century, the Supreme Court interpreted the “under color of” law language of the Civil Rights Acts to include deprivations of constitutional rights caused by state ofﬁcers acting in violation of state law or otherwise without authority: “Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken ‘under color of’ state law.”26 How does “under color of law” express this meaning? Why is action “under color of ofﬁce” contrasted to that of “a naked trespasser”? And what does any of this have to do with the problem of role ambiguity? What Can Be Done by “Color of Law”? A conventional legal analysis would view the phrase “color of ofﬁce” as a term of art that had arbitrarily acquired its meaning through consistent historical usage. But that would miss entirely the semantic content and con- ceptual signiﬁcance of this metaphorical expression. This single phrase actually con- sists of two different metaphors: one, a highly general set of metaphors from perceptual experience; and, the other, a metaphor and a metonymy that arose from speciﬁc social practices relating to governmental ofﬁcers. Despite these differences in origin and struc- ture, each metaphorical concept expresses in a different way the sense of deceptive appearance. While both metaphors are sys- tematically elaborated in ordinary language, it is the second metaphorical conception that is systematic in legal reasoning. Indeed, because it plays a surprisingly important role in legal contexts where the doctrinal term “color of law” is ostensibly irrelevant, we can fairly say that this metaphor constitutes a signiﬁcant, entrenched part of our concep- tual system. Metaphor, in other words, is a mat- ter of thought and not mere language. It refers to a tightly structured set of con- ceptual mappings in which a target domain is understood in terms of a source domain of more readily comprehended, embod- ied, or social experience.27 This conceptual mapping is conventionally represented by means of a mnemonic of the form TARGET- DOMAIN-IS-SOURCE-DOMAIN. But this is only a representation; the metaphor is the set of conceptual mappings and not the mnemonic. So, too, it is important not to confuse the metaphor, which is the concep- tual mapping, with the many metaphorical expressions that are its linguistic manifesta- tions. For example, a conceptual metaphor like CONTROL IS UP motivates many differ- ent metaphorical expressions such as “she held up publication until the footnotes were complete,” “he’s under my thumb,” “she’s on top of the situation,” or “he’s at the height of his power.” Conversely, metaphor- ical expressions that use the same linguistic term can represent entirely different concep- tual metaphors. Thus, metaphorical expres- sions such as “slow up!” and “he’s cooking up a storm” are not instances of a single “up” metaphor, but rather different metaphorical expressions predicated on different concep- tual metaphors – in this case CONTROL IS UP and ACTIVITY IS UP, respectively.* Thus, the nonidentity between a meta- phorical expression and its underlying con- ceptual mapping works both ways: not only can one conceptual mapping be produc- tive of many metaphorical expressions, but one metaphorical expression can be com- posed of more than one mapping. The only * A delightful example is the otherwise contradictory conventional expressions “slow up” and “slow down.” “Slow up” is premised on CONTROL IS UP and con- notes an exercise of mastery or control. “Slow down” is an instance of the ACTIVITY IS UP metaphor and connotes cessation of activity or a decrease of energy. In many contexts, both connotations will be appli- cable and either expression might be used. But in other cases, only one of the conceptual metaphors will make contextual sense – which is why one says “giddy up,” but not “giddy down.”\nWHAT IS THE “COLOR” OF LAW? 369 constraint is that the multiple mappings must be metaphorically coherent. This, as we shall see, is the case with respect to the “color ofﬁce” metaphor. 1. There is a widespread, cross-cultural set of conceptual metaphors based on the MIND-AS-BODY metaphor. In this latter metaphor, the mind is conceptualized as a body moving through space and various entailments of travel are mapped onto intel- lectual operations. Thus: ARGUMENTS (AND OTHER LOGICAL STRUCTURES) ARE JOUR- NEYS, as when the professor asks “Where were we?” or, in questioning a student, “where is this argument going?”; KNOWING IS SEEING, as in a conventional phrase like “which view do you espouse?”; and IDEAS ARE LIGHT-SOURCES, as in familiar expres- sions like “his theory really sheds some light on our problem” or “she wrote a brilliant paper.”28 The ﬁrst, most general sense of the statu- tory expression “under color of” law derives from these metaphors. The simple phrase “under law” is predicated on the CONTROL IS UP metaphor and expresses the sense of lawful action – that is, that the person’s (or institution’s) actions are governed by the law. The meaning of the term “color” derives from the conceptual metaphors KNOWING IS SEEING and IDEAS ARE LIGHT-SOURCES. In its nonmetaphoric sense, color is “[t]he quality or attribute in virtue of which objects present different appearances to the eye, when considered with regard only to the kind of light reﬂected from their surfaces.”29 The metaphorical expression “under color of” law uses two entailments of our every- day knowledge of color. The ﬁrst is that color is a quality of surfaces and, therefore, may reveal absolutely nothing about the inte- rior or substance of the object under view. The second experiential entailment is that color perception is highly dependent upon the quality of light. Some colors are not per- ceptible at night, for example. Similarly, we know that if we view an object in other than white light, the color we see will not be true. Action “under color of” law is action that has only the appearance of being governed by law – that is, it is not action “under law,” but only “under the color of law.”30 Thus, a deprivation of rights “under color of” law connotes an injury by an ofﬁcer acting with an air of authority that is tainted or false.* Or, in the older variant “under color of ofﬁce,” the ofﬁcer presents himself to the victim in a “false light” so that, as Manningham’s coun- sel argued, “the thing is grounded upon vice, and the ofﬁce is as a shadow thereto.” The sense of “color” as “false light,” which derives from the conceptual metaphors KNOWING IS SEEING and IDEAS ARE LIGHT- SOURCES, is systematic in both ordinary English and legal discourse. The common notion that metaphor is merely “colorful” language in contradistinction to “clear” prose is, ironically, an instance of these conceptual metaphors.31 In Two Gentlemen of Verona (act I, scene ii, lines 1–4), Shakespeare uses the phrase “under the color of” to connote deception. Already I have been false to Valentine, And now I must be as unjust to Thurio. Under the color of commending him, I have access my own love to prefer. Another familiar example is the legal con- cept of a “colorable argument,” which con- notes an argument that has surface plausibil- ity (i.e., “color”) but that, when examined closely or thought through clearly, is nev- ertheless wrong. As one court noted: “‘Col- orable’ is deﬁned as ‘having the appearance, especially the false appearance, of right.’”32 Thus, “color” also signiﬁes pretextuality, as in the following rather virulent statement dur- ing the House debate by an opponent of the 1871 Civil Rights Act: Mr. Speaker, under the pretext of protect- ing the people, the people are enslaved; under the pretext of establishing order, lib- * This sense of “color” is not related to the conven- tional expression “true colors.” (As in the sentence: “He acts like a nice guy; but when something impor- tant is at stake, he really shows his true colors.”) As we will see in a moment, the metaphorical expression “true colors” is related to the second sense of “color of law.” But both the expression “true colors” and its complement “under false colors” also take their signiﬁcance from the fact that appearances can be deceiving.\n370 STEVEN L. WINTER erty is being overthrown; under the pretext of securing the rights of the voter, the voter is disenfranchised; under color of maintain- ing the manhood of man in the political equality of the colored man, the manhood of man is denied in the political degrada- tion of the white man.33 A related usage appears in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English law concerning contempt of Parliament, where it refers both to illegal actions and false accusations.34 Across the centuries, the term “color” in legal doctrine has invariably connoted some degree of falsity, ranging from fraud to pre- text to mistaken appearance. In Woolsey v. Dodge, for example, the federal circuit court rejected the defendant’s contention that “the mode of giving jurisdiction in this case is merely colorable; or in other words that it is a fraud upon the law.”35 The term had a dif- ferent, but related connotation in the rather charming medieval doctrine of “colour.” A “colour” was a common law pleading device, already extant by 1400, that continued in use in England until the beginning of the nine- teenth century. The purpose of the device was to avoid pleading the general issue and, thus, take the case away from the jury. It allowed the defendant to convert the issue to a question of law “by giving the plain- tiff a ‘show’ or ‘colour,’ i.e. by imagining a ﬁctitious title for the plaintiff, specious, but inferior to his own, and asking the judgment of the Court upon it.”36 Another usage appears in various nineteenth-century American property law doctrines. Under many state statutes of limitation for cases of adverse possession, for example, a defendant with “color of title” who had been in posses- sion for the requisite period could defeat a plaintiff with superior title.37 There is a related usage of “color of law” as “pretense or appearance of law” that is of par- ticular interest because it was widespread in English political culture during the second half of the seventeenth century. The con- cept of “colour of law” was a potent political and rhetorical tool used by both sides in the political struggle between King and Parlia- ment that culminated in the Revolution of 1688.38 [T]he condemnation of legal form as a weapon of political persecution was used not only against the king but by him, as well, as an offensive device. In the quo warranto proceedings against the City of London, the corporation was charged with the “oppression of the Kings Subjects by Colour of Law.” It was alleged that the City was pretending, and indeed seeming, to act in compliance with law but in fact was not. It is probable that the City was less guilty than the king of the pretense of legal regu- larity. . . . But what is more important is that these allegations were being directed from all sides (p. 65) In subsequent political debate, the claim that a particular procedure had “legal color” was invoked to maintain the appearance of con- tinuity and legitimacy even in the face of substantial change: The argument could be completely wrong and at the same time totally convincing. All that was really required was the appli- cation of legal principle to the political problems at hand. Of little consequence was the relevance of the legal procedures employed. The ‘colour of law’ was usually quite enough. (p. 83) These seventeenth-century debates conﬁrm that “color of law” was more than a technical legal term; by the late seventeenth century, it had become part of the larger English- speaking political culture. In the period leading to the Revolu- tion of 1688, the concern with oppression under pretense of law and abuse of legal form merged with the need to preserve the appearance of legality while one legal regime supplanted its predecessor.39 During Reconstruction, the concern with oppres- sion under pretense of law and abuse of legal form confronted the attempt to subvert the post–Civil War legal regime and to reestab- lish a social and political hierarchy dislodged by military defeat. In a different way in each context, “color of law” was invoked as the tool with which to restore a sense of legal order. In the former period, “by colour of law” marked Parliament’s concern that its political actions be governed by the appear- ance of legality. In the latter period, “under\nWHAT IS THE “COLOR” OF LAW? 371 color of” law signiﬁed Congress’s concern with actions by Southern ofﬁcials that used the appearance of legality to mask oppres- sion. 2. The second sense of “color of law” is contingent on particular social practices relating to government ofﬁcials. Perhaps for that reason, this second sense of “under color of” law seems to be primary. It is the prin- cipal sense that animates the reasoning in many of the most important cases dealing with ofﬁcial misconduct. Moreover, it is the sense that best captures the equivocalness caused by the conceptual opacity of the state and the ambiguous character of its agents. One less familiar connotation of “color” comes from heraldry, where it refers con- cretely to the tints employed in heraldic crests. An early use of the term referred to the insignia of a knight.40 A contemporary usage that bears much the same sense is that of “colors” as referring to the ﬂag and, hence, the ﬂag’s bearers as the “color” guard. (It is this sense that is employed in the phrases “to show one’s true colors” and “acting under false colors.”) In these expressions, “color” is a metonymy where the color – which is often more striking or more easily perceived than the design – stands for the entire emblem. The original expression “by Colour of his Ofﬁce” dates from the previously noted statute of 1275, a time when many of the King’s ofﬁcers and agents would actually have worn the King’s coat of arms. As it is used in this early statute, the metonymic expression “color of ofﬁce” signiﬁed con- duct that had all the trappings and indicia of an ofﬁcial act even though it was without sufﬁcient warrant in law. Thus, the phrase “color of ofﬁce” is a compound metonymic expression: “Color” stands for the King’s coat of arms and the coat of arms stands for the ofﬁce (and/or the King himself). The phrase is also a metaphorical expression once the metonymy is extended to represent the gen- eral concept of ofﬁcial misconduct (that is, without regard to the actual dress of the governmental agent). “Color of ofﬁce” is a metaphor that is based on a metonymy; it signiﬁes the appearance or guise of author- ity. Or, as argued by Maningham’s counsel, “colore ofﬁcii implies that the thing is under pretence of ofﬁce, but not duly, and the ofﬁce is no more than a cloak to deceit (p. 102; emphasis added).” This metaphoric sense of “color of ofﬁce” is not just some ancient relic of interest only to etymologists. There continues to be an experiential grounding for the metaphor in contemporary practices like the uniforms and insignia of the military and police. For example, in Monroe v. Pape, Justice Dou- glas observed “that Congress has power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment against those who carry a badge of authority of a State . . ., whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it.”41 The underlying idea remains the same: The ofﬁ- cer’s attire or vestments signify the ofﬁce, both in the practical sense that they indi- cate the wearer’s position and in the sym- bolic sense that they represent the honor and authority of the ofﬁce. Thus, to “invest” in ofﬁce (from the Latin vestire “to dress”) is “To clothe with or in the insignia of an ofﬁce; hence, with the dignity itself.”42 It was conventional in the nineteenth century to say that one was “vested in ofﬁce,” and the installment of new ofﬁcers is still referred to as an “investiture.” The enduring vitality of the metaphor as part of our conceptual system is conspic- uous in legal doctrine. Virtually all of the modern cases dealing with the meaning of state action under the Fourteenth Amend- ment rely on metaphorical understandings derived from this sense of “color of ofﬁce.” In Ex parte Virginia, where the federal statute at issue did not contain the words “under color of” law, the Supreme Court ﬁrst invoked the guise of authority conception to resolve the state action question: Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the law violates the constitu- tional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State’s power, his act is that of the State. This must be so, or the constitutional prohi- bition has no meaning. Then the State has\n372 STEVEN L. WINTER clothed one of its agents with power to annul or to evade it.43 Similarly, though Justice Frankfurter dis- sented from Monroe’s holding that “under color of” law encompassed unauthorized action by the police, he nevertheless con- ceded that the conduct of the police in that case was state action “because they are clothed with an appearance of ofﬁcial author- ity which is itself a factor of signiﬁcance in dealings between individuals. . . . The aura of power which a show of authority carries with it has been created by state government.”44 In both these quotations (as in the ear- lier quotes from Monroe), the metaphorical sense of “color of ofﬁce” as guise of author- ity is the basis for an inference pattern in which the outward appearance of ofﬁcial power – a “show of authority” under state law – explains why ofﬁcial misconduct falls within the reach of the Fourteenth Amend- ment. Signiﬁcantly, neither of these quotes concerns the interpretation of the statutory phrase “under color of” law; in each case, the pivotal inference that action which consti- tutes an abuse of state authority is never- theless state action prohibited by the Four- teenth Amendment is supplied by the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor. We can observe the complementary metaphorical inference pattern at work in cases involving a state’s immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. In Ex parte Young,45 the Supreme Court used the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor in applying the ultra vires doctrine* to avoid the state sovereign immunity problem: “the ofﬁcer proceeding under such [unconstitutional] enactment comes into conﬂict with the superior author- ity of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his ofﬁcial or representative char- acter and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.”46 Commentators criticize these “classic” doc- trines of state action and ultra vires as logically inconsistent; Justices treat Young as an embarrassing, if necessary ﬁction.47 But this inconsistency arises only on * At common law, an agent who acts outside his authority (ultra vires) cannot bind his principal. a reductive analysis that reiﬁes the state and treats it as a “thing” separate from the actual persons who act in its name. For it is only on that reductive view that the govern- mental agent who acts illegally can be said to act not qua agent, but qua private per- son amenable to a common law action for redress. But there is no state separate from the persons and institutions that embody it; the state exists only because the cultural mean- ing represented by its ofﬁcials has been internalized and actualized by the society in question. Thus, as the Supreme Court pointed out in Ex parte Virginia, the Four- teenth Amendment “must act upon persons, not upon the abstract thing denominated a State.”48 Each of these persons is the social embodiment of the state, whether he is fol- lowing its dictates or ﬂaunting them. An ofﬁcial who abuses his ofﬁce exploits this social meaning, in effect transforming the state into a government of men and not of laws. Thus, although Young remains prob- lematic for other reasons, its doctrine makes quite good sense in the run of the mill case: An ofﬁcial who exploits or abuses his or her ofﬁce is capitalizing on the social meaning of the state – which he or she represents, but does not fully personify. The ofﬁcial acts as the state, but only contingently so as a tem- porary embodiment of that construct. When called to account for his or her actions in violation of that trust, however, the ofﬁcial can be held liable as an individual “stripped of his ofﬁcial or representative character and . . . subjected in his person to the con- sequences of his individual conduct.” It is precisely these connotations that are captured by the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor. It expresses the way in which the trappings of ofﬁce provide a veneer of authority, pro- claiming that the ofﬁcer acts with the full power and prestige of the state. At the same time, however, the metaphor communi- cates the transient and provisional character of that representation – the fact that beneath the uniform and insignia of authority is a per- son who, in any given case, may not conform his or her behavior to the legal requirements of the ofﬁce.\nWHAT IS THE “COLOR” OF LAW? 373 The real problem with Young is that it conﬂates the colore ofﬁcii concept with the doctrine of ultra vires. Where the common law distinguished ofﬁcial misconduct from the act of a “naked trespasser,” Young treats the two as if they were the same. If Young has a ﬁctive quality, it is because it fails to recognize the metaphorical quality of its own reasoning – as if the ofﬁcer actu- ally were “stripped of his ofﬁcial character” and reduced to a “naked trespasser.” This leads to the rather bizarre bit of illogic in which the Court says that: “State ofﬁcials sued for damages in their ofﬁcial capacity are not ‘persons’ for purposes of the suit because they assume the identity of the gov- ernment that employs them. . . . By con- trast, ofﬁcers sued in their personal capac- ity come to court as individuals.”49 The ﬁction common to both these doctrines is that the ofﬁcer is not sued as an individ- ual tortfeasor at common law, but rather as a state ofﬁcial who has violated consti- tutional norms. These are not mistakes that arise under the nonreductive, metaphorical understanding expressed by the colore ofﬁcii concept. The “color of ofﬁce” metaphor has been used by Anglo-American judges and lawyers over hundreds of years and across otherwise unrelated doctrinal categories to express the complex social meaning of ofﬁcial miscon- duct. It is the metaphoric conceptualization by which our legal–political culture histori- cally has mediated the problems arising from the conceptual opacity of the state. As this cultural metaphor has taken shape in the case law, it has an intricate set of sophisti- cated entailments. At the ﬁrst level, it con- notes the sense in which the ofﬁce may serve to camouﬂage or mask misbehavior. As Maningham’s counsel explained, “colore ofﬁcii implies that the thing is under pre- tence of ofﬁce, but not duly, and the ofﬁce is no more than a cloak to deceit.” Accord- ingly, the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor shares with the false light concept the metaphori- cal entailment of deceptive appearance. As noted in Dive, the metaphor conveys that the more serious evil of ofﬁcial misconduct is that the injury is compounded by deception: “As if an ofﬁcer will take more for his fees than he ought, this is . . . robbery, but it is more odious than robbery, for robbery is apparent, and always hath the countenance of vice, but extortion, being equally as great a vice as robbery, carries the mask of virtue.” At the second level, the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor expresses the sense that ofﬁcial misconduct does not have the same social meaning as a private wrong like robbery because, as Justice Frankfurter acknowl- edged, the wrongdoers “are clothed with an appearance of ofﬁcial authority which is itself a factor of signiﬁcance in dealings between individuals.” It signiﬁes the dual character of the ofﬁcer who is both a per- son and the provisional embodiment of the State. When an ofﬁcer commits a wrong: “He does this in his character of sheriff, colore ofﬁcii, and not as a naked trespasser with- out color of authority.” Thus, the problem of conduct under “color of ofﬁce” concerns the distinctive social meaning occasioned by abuse of ofﬁcial authority. When, for exam- ple, Los Angeles police ofﬁcers beat Rodney King, they were acting as police and not as private individuals with a personal vendetta. They were acting as police ofﬁcers and, at the same time, acting in a manner neither autho- rized nor approved by the city, its mayor, or most of its constituents. They were acting ofﬁcially, but not legally. At the third level, “under color of ofﬁce” connotes the sense that the evil of ofﬁcial misconduct is not a matter of deception so much as duplicity and betrayal. In this sense, the notion of “color of ofﬁce” as guise of authority is different than the sense of “under color of” law as false light. The false light metaphor implies that there is some deeper truth beneath the appearance. But the fundamental difﬁculty addressed by the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor is that there is no other reality beneath the social meaning of the state, just as there is no other state sepa- rate from the ofﬁcials who instantiate it. The problem of ofﬁcial misconduct is not one of deceit but of betrayal and abuse. The abu- sive ofﬁcer is not a wolf in sheep’s cloth- ing, but a renegade who appears to be one thing and is that thing even as he betrays\n374 STEVEN L. WINTER his appearance by his action. The actor is an ofﬁcer and a wrongdoer. Thus, the “color of ofﬁce” metaphor signiﬁes that the funda- mental problem is not a matter of truth and falsity, so much as it is a problem of integrity and treachery in the performance of a public trust. To put it another way, the concern is less a matter of truth and deception as it is a matter of virtue and vice. This is the reason that the obverse of “under color of ofﬁce” is “by virtue of ofﬁce” and not simply “under law” or “by author- ity of law.” This understanding is expressed by Coke who, echoing the earlier language of Dive, explained that the import of these terms is a matter of wickedness and virtue: “Colore ofﬁcii is ever taken in malam partem, as virtute ofﬁcii is taken in bonam.” The ofﬁ- cer who acts “under color of ofﬁce” acts within his or her role as an ofﬁcer, but with- out ﬁdelity to that role. Which is why, even the standard deﬁnition of “under color of” law speaks in terms of: “Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law.”50 Action “under color of” law is conduct that is under- stood to be that of the state and, there- fore, has all the affective power of an act of betrayal by those upon whom one relies for protection. Conclusion The case of governmental accountability is a critical one for the legal enterprise. If the law cannot protect us from its own minions, then the ideal of a government of laws and not of men is just a cruel hoax. Faced with this acid test, law’s preferred methodology comes up shockingly short. The obsession of law is deﬁnition and control. Conventional legal reasoning tries to pin things down by identifying principles, drawing distinctions, applying rules, and invoking other necessary and sufﬁcient criteria. Yet, for all these aspi- rations to precision, the standard methodol- ogy of law cannot manage the complexity of the social meaning of the state without turn- ing to the imaginative human capacity that the poet Wallace Stevens calls the “disposi- tion to metaphor.”51 Conventional legal method fares no bet- ter even if we de-escalate the stakes. There has long been a debate about the import of the phrase “under color of” state law as it is used in the Reconstruction Era civil rights statutes. Standard legal analysis of this question takes one of two forms. One approach, prominent in the Supreme Court opinions, is to inquire into the “plain mean- ing” of the statutory phrase. Thus, dissent- ing in Monroe, Justice Frankfurter argued that “the prior decisions . . . have given ‘under color of [law]’ a content that ignores the meaning fairly comported by the words of the text.”52 Yet, in an earlier case, Jus- tice Douglas had come to just the opposite conclusion: “If, as suggested, the statute was designed to embrace only actions which the state in fact authorized, the words ‘under color of state law’ were hardly apt words to express the idea.”53 The principal alternative approach is to inquire into the intent of the legislature that enacted the statute. On this approach, the argument would look something like this: When the “under color of” law phrase was incorporated into the Reconstruction civil rights statutes, it came already freighted with the historical and legal signiﬁcance of six centuries of legal usage. As a mat- ter of the canons of statutory interpreta- tion, we should accord the provision the meaning intended by the legislators. In using the “under color of” law language, Congress adopted a common law term of art with a well-known meaning. That is why the legislative history contains little direct dis- cussion and no explicit deﬁnition of the statutory phrase. In order to maintain ﬁdelity to legislative intent, we must interpret the statute in light of the legal understanding of the phrase that prevailed at the time of the law’s passage.54 One advantage of this argument, aside from its conventionality, is that it offers a coherent way of parsing a statute whose leg- islative history is otherwise rather opaque. But it has several weaknesses familiar to legal critics. How many of those who voted for the statute were lawyers? How many actu- ally knew the technical legal signiﬁcance of\nWHAT IS THE “COLOR” OF LAW? 375 the phrase “under color of” law? And which of the divergent deﬁnitions might they have been familiar with? The cognitive theory of metaphor makes two contributions at this juncture, and at two different levels of sophistication. First, it enables us to assess the ordinary language meaning of the “color of law” metaphor. Cognitive theory provides a methodology supported by extensive empirical evidence that makes it possible to test the compet- ing assertions about the “plain meaning” of the phrase “under color of” law. A cognitive analysis of how the metaphor expresses the meaning that it does leads to the conclusion that, for the ordinary member of our lin- guistic culture, “under color of” law connotes something like “under a false or misleading appearance of lawful authority.” Second, the cognitive theory of metaphor answers the skeptical questions that trou- ble the conventional argument about legislative intent by undermining the fun- damental assumptions that give them force. In the absence of some objectivist the- ory of meaning, the standard approach to statutory interpretation assumes that the historical legal usage of the phrase is relevant only if the legislators were aware of it and intended to incorporate that mean- ing into the statute. This understanding in turn depends on two highly conventional, but mistaken assumptions: (1) that linguis- tic meaning is essentially arbitrary; and (2) that, even if meaning is socially contingent, it is still largely a matter of the conscious intention of self-directing actors. Developments in cognitive theory chal- lenge both these assumptions. First, they present a complex picture of human ratio- nality as an embodied process that is expe- rientially grounded and elaborated imagina- tively through conceptual operations such as metaphor, metonymy, and modeling (rather than rule-governed formulas). One impli- cation of this understanding, however, is that questions of meaning no longer ﬁt into the conventional epistemological categories. The recognition that meaning is grounded in experience entails a rejection of the deter- minacy sought by objectivist logic and the arbitrariness assumed by most social coher- ence theories. Meaning is not determinate. The import of transﬁgurative processes such as metaphor is that there can be no linear, algorithmic function that links experiential input to imaginative output. But neither is meaning arbitrary. Not only is meaning con- ﬁgured by the kinds of bodies and social experiences that we have, it is framed and constrained by the systematic nature of cog- nitive processes like metaphor. To put it another way, human concep- tualizations are not arbitrary in the sense that they can be just anything. Rather, the metaphoric nature of these conceptualiza- tions means that they can be many things of a speciﬁed, related type. Thus, as we have seen, the various legal senses of “color” are organized around a central sense of “color” as “false appearance.” Similarly, the second metaphorical sense of “under color of” law is grounded in socially contingent practices. Here, too, we will see that the historical meaning of the phrase is neither arbitrary nor isolated. Rather, it is related to those practices metaphorically and elaborated in legal reasoning in a systematic and coherent manner. Second, the understanding of human rationality as grounded in experience yields the further conclusion that meaning cannot be viewed as a matter of the conscious inten- tion of self-directing actors. Every aspect of legal reasoning occurs against the backdrop of a massive cultural tableau which provides the tacit assumptions or sedimentations that render those legal conceptions intelligible. Because these socially constructed contexts are always anterior to any of us as individu- als, our very ability to have a world is already constrained by the cultural constructs in which we ﬁnd ourselves. Since legislators, too, can only act in terms of the embedded cultural understandings that enable mean- ing, an important part of any statute is not made by the legislator but is contingent on the preexisting practices that are conven- tional for and constitutive of that culture. The meaning of the “color of law” metaphor is not merely a matter of consistent histor- ical usage by judges and legislators, but a\n376 STEVEN L. WINTER function of its continuing vitality as an embedded part of our culture’s socio- linguistic system. The meaning of “under color of” law, then, is a case where the standard legal tools lead to confusion rather than clarity. Instead of directing us to the historical usage and social meaning of this legal metaphor, con- ventional legal analysis has led lawyers and judges either to parse ﬁgurative language as if it were literal or to plumb in vain the depths of legislative subjectivity. The cogni- tive theory of metaphor, in contrast, opens a treasure trove of historical and semantic insight leading us to see how the conceptual metaphor incorporated in these statutes bet- ter expresses signiﬁcant aspects of our social reality – aspects that are otherwise devalued or eliminated by more conventional, reduc- tive approaches to legal reasoning. So, we now know the answer: Law strives to be black and white. Yet, for all its efforts, it cannot help but express itself in all the colors of human imagination.

This is the sense in which the aspiration to “legal color” dominated political debate in England during the second half of the seventeenth century.

GREY, THE WALLACE STEVENS CASE: LAW AND THE PRACTICE OF POETRY 36 (1991) (“[T]he kind of mis- representation most signiﬁcant in law is the rhetorical coloring of objective reality with subjective wishes and desires. Using rhetori- cal tropes and ﬁgures, a speaker can project emotions to the audience in the guise of objective qualities.”) (emphasis added). The distinction between prose and metaphor is closely related to the Enlightenment concep- tion of Reason, which seeks transparency and strives to avoid the coloration of emotion. See, e.g., LOCKE, supra note 1 (“But if we would speak of things as they are, we must allow that all the art of rhetoric, besides order and clearness; all the artiﬁcial and ﬁgurative appli- cations of words eloquence hath invented, are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas, move the passions, and thereby mislead the judgment.”). 32 Virginia v.

A related usage of “color of title” in the sense of apparent authority appears in Cocke v. Halsey, 41 U.S. 71 (1842). There, the Supreme Court held that, even if the clerk’s appoint- ment had been irregular under state law, the fact that he had “color of title” meant that his acts were “colore ofﬁcii” and binding on third parties.

Given these parts, a number of ques- tions arise, including the following: (1) What are emotion metaphors, metonymies, related concepts, and how are they all related to each other? (2) Is there a “master metaphor” for the emotions? (3) Are emotion metaphors unique to the emotions? (4) How do emotion metaphors differ from metaphors for other related domains, such as human relationships? (5) What is the precise role of metaphors, metonymies, and related concepts in the cognitive construction of particular emo- tion concepts? (6) Are emotion metaphors universal? In my view, the major ﬁnding that emerges from the study of metaphors char- acterizing the emotion domain is that, essentially, there are no emotion-speciﬁc metaphors. If this ﬁnding is correct and if it can be generalized to other domains, it will turn out that our metaphorical concep- tual system is organized by a hierarchy of metaphors at different levels of speciﬁcity. This idea was ﬁrst suggested by K¨ovecses (1995a, 2000a) in his study of friendship and the notion of the “scope of metaphor,” and it seems that the study of emotion metaphors provides further evidence for the feasibility of such a proposal. (1) What Are Emotion Metaphors, Metonymies, and Related Concepts? It is a well established feature of emo- tion language that it is highly ﬁgurative; that is, it is dominated by metaphorical and metonymic expressions. It is also well known that most of these expressions belong to a variety of conceptual metaphors and metonymies. Below is a selection of such conceptual metaphors and metonymies in two emotion concepts: anger and love. Each conceptual metaphor and metonymy is illustrated by at least one linguistic example. 380\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 381 Metaphors Anger: anger is hot ﬂuid in a container: She is boil- ing with anger. anger is ﬁre: He’s doing a slow burn. His anger is smoldering. anger is insanity: The man was insane with rage. anger is an opponent in a struggle: I was struggling with my anger. anger is a captive animal: He unleashed his anger. anger is a burden: He carries his anger around with him. the cause of anger is trespassing: Here I draw the line. the cause of anger is physical annoyance: He’s a pain in the neck. anger is a natural force: It was a stormy meeting. anger is a social superior: His actions were completely governed by anger. Love: love is a nutrient: I am starved for love. love is a journey: It’s been a long, bumpy road. love is a unity of parts: We’re as one. They’re breaking up. We’re insepara- ble. We fused together. love is a bond: There is a close tie between them. love is a ﬂuid in a container: She was over- ﬂowing with love. love is ﬁre: I am burning with love. love is an economic exchange: I’m putting more into this than you are. love is a natural force: She swept me off my feet. love is a physical force: I was magnetically drawn to her. love is an opponent: She tried to ﬁght her feelings of love. love is a captive animal: She let go of her feelings. love is war: She conquered him. love is insanity: I am crazy about you. love is a social superior: She is completely ruled by love. love is rapture / a high: I have been high on love for weeks. the object of love is a small child: Well, baby, what are we gonna do? the object of love is a deity: Don’t put her on a pedestal. He worships her. In general, it can be suggested that a concep- tual metaphor consists of a source and a tar- get domain and that the source domain is, at least in the everyday cases, typically a better understood and more concrete domain than the target domain. Clearly, this generaliza- tion has certain limits, as, for instance, the conceptual metaphor THE OBJECT OF LOVE IS A DEITY indicates. Metonymies Conceptual metonymies, unlike conceptual metaphors, involve a single domain, or con- cept. The purpose of metonymy is to pro- vide mental access to a domain through a part of the same domain (or vice versa) or to a part of a domain through another part in the same domain (for more explanation of the nature of metonymy, see K¨ovecses & Radden, 1998). Thus, metonymy, unlike metaphor, is a “stand-for” relation (i.e., a part stands for the whole or a part stands for another part) within a single domain. Some examples follow (taken from K¨ovecses, 2000): Love: increase in body heat stands for love: I felt hot all over when I saw her. increase in heart rate stands for love: He’s a heart-throb. blushing stands for love: She blushed when she saw him. dizziness stands for love: She’s in a daze over him. I feel dizzy every time I see her. sweaty palms stand for love: His palms became sweaty when he looked at her. inability to breathe stands for love: You take my breath away. interference with accurate perception stands for love: He saw nothing but her. inability to think stands for love: He can’t think straight when around her. physical closeness stands for love: They are always together. intimate sexual behavior stands for love: She showered him with kisses. He caressed her gently. sex stands for love: They made love.\n382 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES loving visual behavior stands for love: He can’t take his eyes off of her. She’s starry-eyed. In other words, emotion metaphors and metonymies can be conceptual and linguis- tic in Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) sense. When I talk about emotion metaphors and metonymies, I will mean conceptual metaphors and conceptual metonymies of the kind indicated in small caps above. There is an important connection between emotion metaphors and meto- nymies; namely, that the metonymies can be said to motivate the metaphors. This motivation is not simply linguistic or con- ceptual but also physical, in the sense that the metonymies indicate certain physical aspects of the body involved in emotion. The physical aspect indicated by emotion metonymies can be factored into two types: behavioral and physiological. For example, INTIMATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR and LOVING VISUAL BEHAVIOR are behavioral responses that metonymyically indicate love, while AN INCREASE IN HEART RATE is a physiological one. Both types can be speciﬁc or generic. LOVING VISUAL BEHAVIOR is speciﬁc to love but AN INCREASE IN HEART RATE is general, in that it characterizes both love and anger, among other emotions. Another property of such behavior- and physiology-based metonymies is that, taken jointly, they provide a speciﬁc proﬁle for basic-level emotion concepts, such as anger, fear, and love. Related Concepts A special case of emotion metonymies involves a situation in which an emotion concept B is part of another emotion con- cept A (see, for example, K¨ovecses 1986, 1990, 1991a, 1991b). In cases like this, B can metonymically stand for A. This can explain why for instance the word girlfriend can be used of one’s partner in a love relation- ship. Since love (A), at least ideally, involves or assumes friendship (B) between the two lovers, the word friend (an instance of B) can be used to talk about an aspect of love (A). There is a large range of emotion con- cepts that are related to love. The con- cepts express, and also deﬁne, the range of attitudes we have toward the beloved. We can call them “related concepts.” These concepts comprise literal general knowledge based on our various conception(s) of love (see K¨ovecses, 1988). Some of the most important related concepts for love include liking, sexual desire, intimacy, longing, affec- tion, caring, respect, and friendship. Related concepts can be placed along a gradient of their centrality in the deﬁnition of an emo- tion concept, such as love; some of them appear to be inherent parts of the conception of love (such as liking and affection), some of them are only loosely associated with it, in that they are a part of some idealized model of love (such as friendship or respect), and some fall in between (such as caring). (For the linguistic justiﬁcation of these claims, see K¨ovecses, 1988, 1990, 1991a). (2) Is There a “Master Metaphor” for Emotion? The examination of emotion metaphors, such as the ones above, raises the issue of whether the conceptual metaphors that characterize particular emotions are isolated and independent of each other, or alterna- tively, they form some kind of a general system in the sense that they are instanti- ations of a generic or high-level superordi- nate metaphor? To put the same question more simply, we can ask, Is there a “master metaphor” for emotion? As can be seen from the examples above, anger and love are characterized by an over- lapping set of metaphors, including FIRE, INSANITY, NATURAL FORCE, BURDEN, and others. If two very different emotions such as anger and love share so much metaphori- cal structure, then we can expect other emo- tions (at least the basic, or primary ones, like fear, joy, sadness, and lust) to share just as much or more. Indeed, the study of such emotion concepts shows that there is a great deal of overlap among the metaphors that characterize them (K¨ovecses, 2000b). Given this, it might be the case that there exists\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 383 a master metaphor for the emotions. But if it does exist, what could it be like? Len Talmy (1988) observed that many aspects of language can be proﬁtably described and explained by what he called “force- dynamics” (Talmy, 1988). The description of an event in terms of force dynamics involves the following parts: Force entities: Agonist Antagonist Intrinsic force tendency: toward action toward rest (inaction) Resultant of the force interaction: action rest (inaction) Balance of strengths: the stronger entity the weaker entity Let us now examine the most basic and skeletal emotion scenario in our folk theory of emotion. In this scenario, there is a cause that induces a person (self) to have an emo- tion, and the emotion causes the person to produce some response. In a schematic way, this can be given as: (1) a cause leads to emotion and (2) emo- tion leads to some response. Since we know from the Event Structure metaphor (Lakoff, 1990) that causes are con- ceptualized as forces (hence, CAUSES ARE FORCES), we can regard “cause” in part one and “emotion” in part two as forces. This then allows us to apply force dynamics to the emotion domain. Let us ﬁrst look at the ﬁrst part of the scenario. If we think of the agonist as an entity that has an intrinsic force tendency toward inaction, that is, to stay inactive or at rest, the corresponding entity will be the self in the emotion domain; and if we think of the antagonist as an entity that has an intrinsic force tendency toward action, that is, to overcome the inaction of the agonist, to cause it to act, the corresponding entity will be the cause of emotion in the emotion domain. Consider now the second part of the sce- nario, using the same deﬁnition of agonist and antagonist as before. If we think of the agonist as an entity that has an intrinsic force tendency toward inaction, the correspond- ing entity will be the self again, who will produce some kind of response. And if we think of the antagonist as an entity that has an intrinsic force tendency toward action, the corresponding entity will be the emo- tion itself. In other words, in both cases the emotion agonist will be the self (in that it becomes emotional in part one, and it produces a response in part two) and the emotion antagonist will be the cause of emotion in the ﬁrst part and the emotion itself in the second part of the scenario. These instantiations of the abstract force- dynamic schema will apply to the major- ity of emotion metaphors (though not to all). Source domains that tend to focus on the ﬁrst part of the basic emotion sce- nario are mostly PHYSICAL FORCES, either MECHANICAL or MAGNETIC. By contrast, source domains that tend to focus on the second part include OPPONENT, NATURAL FORCE, SOCIAL SUPERIOR, and the like. (For a more detailed discussion, see K¨ovecses, 2000b, chap. 5.) Now let us take some conceptual metaphors and see how force dynamics applies to them. We can begin with EMO- TION IS AN OPPONENT (IN A STRUGGLE). Consider some examples for this metaphor: Emotion is an opponent. He was seized by emotion. He was struggling with his emotions. I was gripped by emotion. She was overcome by emotion. There are two opponents in this struggle. As the ﬁrst and third examples suggest, one opponent is inactive (the one that is seized and gripped all of a sudden). This is the agonist. The other, the one who seizes and grips, is active and attempts to cause oppo- nent one to give in to his force. This is the antagonist. There is some struggle in which opponent one tries to resist opponent two’s force and opponent two tries to make him give in to his force. There is the pos- sibility of either opponent one winning or\n384 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES Table 21.1: Emotion is an opponent Metaphorical mapping Agonist’s force tendency Antagonist’s force tendency Resultant action Source Opponent 1 opponent 1’s attempt to resist opponent 2 Opponent 2 opponent 2’s attempt to cause opponent 1 to give in to his force either opponent 2 wins or opponent 1 wins Target Rational self self’s attempt to try to maintain control Emotion the emotion causing the self to lose control self either loses or maintains control Source: OPPONENT IN A STRUGGLE Target: EMOTION opponent two winning. Corresponding to opponent one in the source is the rational self in the target, while corresponding to opponent two in the source is the emotion in the target domain. Corresponding to oppo- nent one’s force tendency in the source is the rational self’s force tendency to try to main- tain control over the emotion, and corre- sponding to opponent two’s force tendency is the emotion’s force tendency to cause the self to lose control. This force-dynamic inter- pretation can be represented in Table 21.1. Next let us take the NATURAL FORCE metaphor. When this is applied to emo- tion, the underlying logic is that there is an extremely forceful entity (like wind, wave, storm, etc.) that affects a physical object and this object can’t help but undergo its usually disastrous effects. When people say that they are overwhelmed by an emotion or that they are swept off their feet, it is this kind of effect that they imagine. This metaphor encapsu- lates perhaps the most deeply seated belief about emotions; namely, that we are pas- sive and helpless in relation to them, just as physical objects are passive and helpless in relation to powerful natural forces acting on them. Schematically again, Table 21.2 captures all this. The OPPONENT and NATURAL FORCE metaphors both focus on the second part of the skeletal emotion scenario—“emotion → response.” The last metaphor of emotion that I use to demonstrate the workings of force dynamics in the conceptualization of emotions is the EMOTION IS A PHYSICAL FORCE metaphor. This metaphor tends to have its main focus on the ﬁrst part of the emotion scenario— “cause →emotion.” It comes in a variety of forms (MECHANICAL, ELECTRIC, GRAVITA- TIONAL, MAGNETIC), which are illustrated with some examples below: E MOTION IS A PHYSICAL FORCE: EMOTION IS A MECHANICAL FORCE; EMOTIONAL EFFECT IS PHYSICAL CONTACT When I found out, it hit me hard. That was a terrible blow. She knocked me off my feet. EMOTION IS A MAGNETIC FORCE I was magnetically drawn to her. I am attracted to her. She found him irresistible. That repels me. In the source domain, there is a physical object with the force tendency toward inac- tion, that is, to continue to be as before. There is also another force-exerting entity here, a physical force that has the force ten- dency to produce some effect in the object. Correspondingly, there is a rational self that has the force tendency to stay as before (that is, unemotional), and there is a cause (of emotion) that has the force tendency to cause the self to become emotional. This situation is depicted by such examples as “The news hit me hard” or “I was attracted to her,” where a cause of emotion acts on the rational self causing it to become emotional.\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 385 Table 21.2: Emotion is a natural force Metaphorical mapping Agonist’s force tendency Antagonist’s force tendency Resultant action Source Physical object to keep being the same Natural force to cause an effect in physical object physical object undergoes effect in a passive way Target Rational self to continue to behave as before the emotion Emotion to cause the self to respond to emotion self responds to the emotion in a passive way Source: NATURAL FORCE Target: EMOTION Again, Table 21.3 presents this logic in dia- grammatic form. We can represent this interplay of forces in emotion as a conceptually richer version of our initial skeletal emotion scenario: (1) cause of emotion – force tendency of the cause of emotion <—> rational self – force tendency of self →(2) self has emotion →(3) self’s force tendency <—> force ten- dency of emotion →(4) self’s emotional response In this richer schema, it becomes clear that the various components of the emo- tion domain are conceptualized as forces that interact with each other. The schema shows that there are two main points of ten- sion in the experience of emotion: the ﬁrst taking place between the cause of emotion and the rational self, resulting in the emer- gence of emotion, and the second between the self that has the emotion but who is still in control over it and the force of the emotion, resulting in the self losing control and producing an emotional response. Most (though not all) metaphors in the emotion domain can be characterized as an interac- tion of forces. This leads to the conclusion that there exists a single master metaphor for emotion: EMOTIONS ARE FORCES. A large number of emotion metaphors are speciﬁc- level instantiations of this superordinate- level metaphor, each playing a some- what different role in conceptualizing the emotion domain. (3) Are Emotion Metaphors Unique to the Emotions? We have seen above that emotion metaphors are largely instances of a generic-level “mas- ter metaphor” EMOTION IS FORCE. How- ever, it is another question whether the FORCE metaphor instantiated in a variety Table 21.3: Emotion is a physical force Metaphorical mapping Agonist’s force tendency Antagonist’s force tendency Resultant action Source Physical object to remain unaffected by force Physical force to produce effect in object object undergoes effect Target Self to remain unemotional Cause of emotion to cause self to become emotional self is emotional Source: PHYSICAL FORCE Target: EMOTION\n386 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES of ways is speciﬁc to the emotion domain. Theoretically, this possibility seems like a valid option. But to decide what is actu- ally the case is an empirical question. We have to check whether the various FORCE metaphors identiﬁed for the emotion domain, such as PRESSURIZED CONTAINER, OPPONENT, NATURAL FORCE, BURDEN, and so on, are used in the conceptualization of domains other than the emotions. Let us begin with the PRESSURIZED CON- TAINER metaphor. It is clear that it has uses outside the emotion domain, such as when we talk about “trouble brewing” or a “situa- tion being explosive.” OPPONENT metaphors are not limited to the emotions either. In addition to “struggling with my emotions,” I may be “struggling with differential equa- tions.” And the same goes for NATURAL FORCE, BURDEN, and all the other FORCE metaphors discussed earlier. This situation suggests a somewhat surprising conclusion; namely, that there seem to be no emotion- speciﬁc conceptual metaphors. The various FORCE metaphors we have looked at all appear to have applications outside the emo- tion domain, and in this sense cannot be regarded as emotion-speciﬁc. More generally, it could perhaps be argued that our metaphorical conceptual system does not consist of domain-speciﬁc sets of metaphors. Instead, it seems to be structured by more extensive and inclu- sive metaphorical source domains, such as FORCE. Elsewhere, I point out that the FORCE metaphor characterizes not only the emotion domain but also morality and ratio- nal thought (see K¨ovecses, 2000b). By claiming that the source domain of FORCE functions as a master metaphor for emotion and that its application extends beyond the emotions, I do not claim that some other metaphors of emotion cannot be emotion-speciﬁc. They can be. There are some source domains that seem to be both speciﬁc to a particular emotion and limited to the emotion domain. These include TRESPASSING, PHYSICAL ANNOY- ANCE for ANGER; HIDDEN ENEMY, SUPER- NATURAL BEING for FEAR; BEING OFF THE GROUND, AN ANIMAL THAT LIVES WELL, PLEASURABLE PHYSICAL SENSATION for HAPPINESS; HAVING NO CLOTHES ON, DECREASE IN SIZE, BLOCKING OUT THE WORLD for SHAME. For example, trespass- ing leads to anger, dancing about (in being off the ground) indicates happiness, and decrease in size shows that the person is ashamed or embarrassed. How can we account for the emotion-speciﬁcity of these source domains? I’d like to suggest that the speciﬁcity of the source domains derives from two factors. Some of them have to do with causes of emo- tion, whereas some of them have to do with effects of emotion. Both the causes and the effects in question appear to be unique to a given emotion. Thus, for example, it can be suggested that given the metaphor SHAME IS HAVING NO CLOTHES ON, having no clothes on is a potential cause for shame and it is typically associated with shame. Or, to take another example, dancing and jumping up and down (but not stomping your feet) is typically associated with joy/happiness and it is seen as a result or effect of this emotion; hence the metaphor HAPPINESS IS BEING OFF THE GROUND (which, unlike the “UP” metaphor, is not an evaluative “orientational metaphor” in the Lakoff-Johnson sense). More generally, we can say that emo- tions can be, and are, comprehended via both their assumed typical causes and their assumed typical effects. When this hap- pens, we can get emotion-speciﬁc metaphor- ical source domains. Here are some of the emotion-speciﬁc metaphors deriving from assumed typical causes and effects of partic- ular emotions: EMOTION IS A CAUSE OF THAT EMOTION: ANGER IS TRESPASSING ANGER IS PHYSICAL ANNOYANCE FEAR IS A HIDDEN ENEMY FEAR IS A SUPERNATURAL BEING A HAPPY PERSON IS AN ANIMAL THAT LIVES WELL HAPPINESS IS A PLEASURABLE PHYSICAL SENSATION SHAME IS HAVING NO CLOTHES ON EMOTION IS AN EFFECT OF THAT EMOTION: happiness is being off the ground shame is a decrease in size to be ashamed is to block out the world\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 387 Although the particular source domains are unique to particular emotion concepts, the cognitive mechanism of understand- ing a state-event (in this case, an emotion state-event) in terms of its cause or effect is fairly general (see K¨ovecses, 1991b, 1994). The nature of this process is essen- tially metonymic (see K¨ovecses & Radden, 1998). In sum, it appears that the major emo- tion metaphors, that is, which have some kind of FORCE as their source, apply outside the emotion domain and thus in this sense they are not emotion-speciﬁc. At the same time, there are some minor metaphors that appear to be emotion-speciﬁc. The justiﬁca- tion for the distinction between major and minor metaphors is based on the constitu- tive role that the “major” metaphors play in the construction of emotion concepts. (4) How Do Emotion Metaphors Differ from Metaphors for Relationships? If emotion concepts are characterized by the EMOTIONS ARE FORCES superordinate metaphor, we can ask which metaphor characterizes neighboring domains. A domain that is conceptually close to that of emotion is human relationships, including love, friendship, and marriage. K¨ovecses (1995a) looked at the American conception of friendship on the basis of a number of interviews conducted with several Americans. The linguistic data provided by the interviews indicate that there are a large number of conceptual metaphors (such as FRIENDSHIP IS A BUILDING) that apply to the American conception of friendship. The analysis of these metaphors also showed that they come from a small number of metaphorical systems: metaphors for Communication (e.g., COMMUNICATION IN FRIENDSHIP IS SHARING OBJECTS), for Emotion (e.g., EMOTIONAL INTENSITY IS TEMPERATURE, EMOTIONAL CLOSENESS IS PHYSICAL CLOSENESS), for States and Relationships (e.g., STATES ARE OBJECTS, RELATIONSHIPS ARE BONDS, INTERACTIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE ECONOMIC EXCHANGES), for Com- plex Systems (e.g., ABSTRACT COMPLEX SYSTEMS ARE BUILDINGS/ MACHINES, etc.), for Events (e.g., LIFE IS A JOURNEY), and for Positive/Negative Evaluation (e.g., DESIR- ABLE ENTITIES ARE VALUABLE THINGS). Moreover, it was shown that these metaphors also apply to the conceptu- alization of other human relationships, in particular, to love and marriage. Love is a special case here because it functions both as an emotion and a relationship. In each of these systems, we have a com- plex abstract concept as target domain and a simpler, nonabstract concept as a source domain. Communication is understood as the sharing of physical objects; emotions as physical phenomena (e.g., properties of physical objects); states as physical objects and relationships as bonds; complex abstract systems as complex physical objects; events as physical motion; and the property of being positive or negative as value or lack of value. Now we are in a position to attempt to answer the question how the metaphorical conceptualization of emotion differs from that of human relationships, like friend- ship, love, and marriage. The speciﬁc-level source domains that can be found in the con- ceptualization of most human relationships include the following: Sharing (experience) objects Distance (close/distant) Warmth Bond Economic exchange Building Implement Machine Plant Journey Valuable commodity This list and the list of emotion metaphors do not provide a complete set of speciﬁc source domains for either human relation- ships or emotions; nevertheless, taking the lists above as a representative set of source domains for emotions and relationships, we can make some interesting observations.\n388 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES There seems to be only a minimal over- lap between the two sets. Human relation- ships share CLOSENESS and WARMTH with emotions. BURDEN from the emotion set may perhaps also apply to relationships since it has the general meaning of indicating any difﬁculty or stress. When characteristic emo- tion metaphors, that is, the FORCE-related ones, apply to human relationships, they usually have to do with love only – a human relationship that is also an emotion. This explains why there are only marginal cases of FORCE metaphors for friendship, which is, as studies show, regarded as a poor case of emotion. (It may be that some of the debate concerning whether love is or is not an emotion, or whether it is a basic emo- tion, is also attributable to this “double- nature” of love.) In her study of love, Bax- ter (1992) found that FORCE metaphors form the third largest group of metaphors for love, following metaphors related to WORK and JOURNEY. In our terms, it is the COM- PLEX SYSTEMS metaphor that involves all the work-related aspects of friendship and relationships in general. But the really important point is that, as we saw in the previous section, the emo- tion metaphors are predominantly “force- related” ones organized into a coherent sys- tem by the underlying master metaphor EMOTION IS FORCE. What is obvious at ﬁrst glance is that the typical relationship metaphors are not FORCE metaphors (with the exception of love, as we noted). The question is, Is there a master metaphor underlying the various speciﬁc-level non- force metaphors for human relationships? JOURNEY seems to be a crucially impor- tant metaphor in the conceptualization of love and marriage, as the studies by Baxter (1992) and Quinn (1991) indicate. However, it appears to play only a marginal role in the comprehension of friendship. The source domains for friendship on the list above that belong to robust metaphor- ical systems in our conception of relation- ships are SHARING (EXPERIENCE) OBJECTS, BONDS, and ECONOMIC EXCHANGE char- acterizing INTERACTIVE RELATIONSHIPS, on the one hand, and BUILDING, IMPLE- MENT, MACHINE, and PLANT, on the other, characterizing COMPLEX ABSTRACT SYS- TEMS. The category of INTERACTIVE RELA- TIONSHIPS is a conﬂation of what I called the “communication system” and the “state” system, respectively. The “state” system, as characterized above, includes states, rela- tionships, and interactions. The metaphors for communication as analyzed above indi- cate that communication is viewed as a form of interaction, and as such it ﬁts the INTER- ACTIVE RELATIONSHIP group naturally. The rest of the metaphorical source domains, such as BUILDING, MACHINE, IMPLEMENT, PLANT, for example, form the COMPLEX ABSTRACT SYSTEMS group (for details see K¨ovecses, 1995, 2000b). In other words, these are the two metaphor systems that stand out in the materials that have been examined. The available evidence concerning human relationships points to the conclusion that it is these two large systems that orga- nize most of our everyday understand- ing of what human relationships are. The bulk of the data presented in the stud- ies mentioned above shows that much of the content and structure of our knowl- edge about relationships derives from the rich set of mappings that characterize the two systems. In this sense, we seem to have two underlying generic-level metaphors for human relationships: INTERACTIVE RELA- TIONSHIPS ARE ECONOMIC EXCHANGES and COMPLEX ABSTRACT SYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX PHYSICAL OBJECTS. Of the two, the latter appears to be the more pervasive and dominant one in the data, and thus, again in this sense, it can be regarded as the “master metaphor” for human relationships. However, it has to be noted that, unlike emo- tions, human relationships do not seem to be characterized by a single and clear-cut over- arching master metaphor. (5) What Is the Role of Metaphors in the Cognitive Construction of Particular Emotion Concepts? In order to answer the question in the title of this subsection, we have to look at some of the details of the relationship between\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 389 “dominant,” or “central,” metaphors for emotion concepts, on the one hand, and the cultural models, on the other, that character- ize these emotion concepts. I will take the emotion concept of ANGER as an example. Lakoff and K¨ovecses (1987) characterized the naive, or folk, understanding of anger in English as a prototypical cognitive, or cul- tural, model. They suggested the following model based on linguistic evidence in Amer- ican English: 1. Offending event Wrongdoer offends self. Wrongdoer is at fault. The offending event displeases self. The intensity of the offense outweighs the intensity of the retribution (which equals zero at this point), thus creat- ing an imbalance. The offense causes anger to come into existence. 2. Anger Anger exists. Self experiences physiological effects (heat, pressure, agitation). Anger exerts force on the self to attempt an act of retribution. 3. Attempt to control anger Self exerts a counterforce in an attempt to control anger. 4. Loss of control The intensity of anger goes above the limit. Anger takes control of self. Self exhibits angry behavior (loss of judgment, aggressive actions). There is damage to self. There is danger to the target of anger, in this case, the wrongdoer. 5. Retribution Self performs retributive act against wrongdoer (this is usually angry behavior). The intensity of retribution balances the intensity of offense. The intensity of anger drops to zero. Anger ceases to exist. The main idea here was that the metaphors and metonymies associated with anger con- verge on and constitute the model, with the different metaphors and metonymies map- ping onto different parts of the model. Native speakers of Hungarian seem to have the same cultural model of anger (d¨uh). The but-test that Lakoff and K¨ovecses (1987) used to ascertain the validity of the model for English yields the same results for speak- ers of Hungarian as it does for speakers of English. For example, the sentence “He was angry, but he didn’t lose control” and its Hungarian equivalent sound more natu- ral than the sentence “He was very angry, but he lost control” in both languages. This is because the conjunction “but” is used to counter expectations. In this case, the expec- tation dictated by the prototypical model would be that once we’re very angry (stage 2), we tend to lose control (stage 4). In other words, the applicability of the but-test indi- cates deviation from the prototypical cul- tural model. Since it indicates the same kinds of deviations in the two languages, it also shows that the underlying prototypical cul- tural models have a similar overall structure. In the characterization of Japanese ikari (and, less typically, also hara), Matsuki (1995) notes in connection with the model found in American English: “The scenario applies to Japanese anger, although Stage 3 is more elaborate than in English” (p. 145). In the Japanese conception, the control aspect of ikari is more elaborate because anger ﬁrst appears in hara, then it goes up to mune, and ﬁnally to atama. As Matsuki points out, hara is a container (the stomach/bowels area) and, metonymically (CONTAINER FOR CON- TENT), can also be the emotion itself. Mune is the chest and atama is the head. If anger reaches atama, the angry person is unable to control anger. King (1989) suggests that there are two prototypical cognitive models operating in Chinese: 1. Offending event Wrongdoer offends self. The offending event displeases self. The offense causes an imbalance in the body.\n390 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES 2. Anger Anger exists. Self experiences physiological effects (heat, pressure, agitation). 3. Attempt to control anger Self exerts a counterforce in an attempt to control anger. 4. Release of anger Self releases anger by exhibiting angry behavior. 5. Restoration of equilibrium The amount of discharged anger balances the excess in the body. The imbalance disappears and equilibrium is restored. The other model differs from the one above in stages 4 and 5: 4. Diversion The force of anger is diverted to var- ious parts of the body. Self exhibits somatic effects (head- aches, stomachaches, etc.) 5. Compensating event The compensating event pleases the self (this is usually sympathetic behavior directed at self). The intensity of compensation balances the intensity of the offense. The somatic effects of anger disappear. Anger ceases to exist. In addition to the several differences, we ﬁnd several things in common among these models. They all seem to be composed of several successive stages, and they all seem to have an ontological, a causal, and an expressive aspect. Based on the characteri- zations given earlier, the following general structure of the respective emotion con- cepts (anger, d¨uh, ikari/hara, and nu) can be identiﬁed. The prototypical cognitive models have an ontological part that gives us an idea of the ontological status and nature of anger, that is, the kind of thing/event it is: in all four languages anger, or its counterpart, is a force inside the person that can exert pressure on him or her. The ontological part also includes some physiological processes associated with the respective emotion. It is the ontological part of the model that constitutes the second stage of the cognitive model or scenario as a whole. The ﬁrst stage in the model corresponds to the causal part. This presents anger and its counterparts as an emotion that is caused, or produced, by a certain situation. Still another part of the model is con- cerned with the expressive component; that is, the ways in which anger, or its counter- part is expressed in the different cultures. The cognitive models tell us that all four cul- tures conceive of anger as something that is somehow expressed. Finally, the expressive component is pre- ceded by a control component that is mani- fested as two separate stages of the model: attempt at controlling expression and loss of control over expression. Thus, the resulting ﬁve-stage model for the four cultures seems to be the following: (1) cause →(2) existence of anger, or its counterpart (in the form of a force) →(3) attempt at control →(4) loss of control → (5) expression (Here, the arrow →indicates temporal suc- cession and causal sequence). Since expres- sion and control are closely linked with each other (i.e., at issue is the control of expres- sion), it is possible to conceive of the two as a single aspect and refer to them as the expression part of the model, yielding the highly schematic model: cause →existence of emotion (as forceful entity) →expression. This then seems to be the most basic struc- ture that all four cultures share in their folk understanding. This is the generalized model of emotions that we saw in a previous section. But how can metaphors create such a model? My suggestion is that this hap- pens by means of the set of mappings that characterize conceptual metaphors. Some\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 391 metaphors play a central role in deﬁning a particular model for a concept. In the case of anger, the central metaphor that “lends” structure to the model of anger in a variety of cultures is that of THE ANGRY PERSON IS A PRESSURIZED CONTAINER. The particular structure that anger and other emotion concepts share is the “cause- existence of emotion-expression” schema. This is deﬁned, in large part, by the PRESSUR- IZED CONTAINER metaphor that is charac- terized by the following mappings. (Unlike above, here the arrow →indicates simulta- neous activation of elements in the source and the target, but, in a historical perspec- tive, I would claim that the relationship between the simultaneously activated ele- ments was also temporal and causal): the container with the substance (ﬂuid or gas) →the person who is angry the heat or pressure of the substance →the intensity of anger the forceful substance in the container → the anger trying to keep the forceful substance inside the container →trying to control the anger the substance going out of the container → the involuntary expression of the anger I believe that these are the mappings that play a constitutive role in the construction of the basic structure of the folk under- standings of anger and its counterparts in different cultures. Without these mappings (i.e., imposing the schematic structure of how the force of a ﬂuid or gas behaves in a container onto anger), it is difﬁcult to see how anger and its counterparts could have acquired the structure they seem to possess: a situation producing a force inside a person, and then the force causing the person to act in certain ways that should be suppressed. The “cause-emotion force- involuntary expression” structure remains a mystery and a completely random occur- rence without evoking the PRESSURIZED CONTAINER metaphor. Through its detailed mappings, the metaphor provides a coherent structure for the concepts. In the view presented here, the concep- tual metaphors and metonymies contribute actively to the structure and content of the prototypical cultural models. To illustrate this with another example, consider Zulu. In Zulu, the chief conceptual metaphor that does the job of providing the skeletal struc- ture for anger is a version of the PRES- SURIZED CONTAINER metaphor: ANGER IS IN THE HEART (K¨ovecses, 2000a; Taylor & Mbense, 1998). However, just like in English, additional metaphors focus on particular aspects of this generic structure. In the case of Zulu anger, two metaphors are espe- cially important for the “expression” part of the basic model, which speciﬁes the nature and intensity of angry behavior. Speakers of Zulu elaborate on two metaphors that speakers of English do not (or do to a much smaller degree): ANGER (DESIRE) IS HUNGER and ANGER IS A NATURAL FORCE (Taylor & Mbense, 1998). If the metaphor DESIRE IS HUNGER is elaborated as vora- cious appetite that devours everything indis- criminately and NATURAL FORCE as a force that destroys everything, as is the case in Zulu, then this will probably inﬂuence the cultural model of anger, as is indeed the case according to Taylor and Mbense. Instead of venting their anger on a speciﬁc tar- get (in English, the person who offended you), Zulu people appear to respond in a less clearly directed way and behave aggressively toward everyone indiscrimi- nately. This is not to say that English can- not have this response or that Zulu cannot have the directed response; rather, the two languages seem to differ in what they con- sider the prototypical cultural model for the concept. The major claim I am making here is this: Systematic links take us from (possibly uni- versal) actual physiology of anger through conceptualized metonymy and metaphor to cultural models. In the process, the broader cultural contexts also play a cru- cial role, in that they ﬁll out the details left open in the schematic basic structure. In other words, I believe that we can offer a satisfactory explanation of the emergence of cultural models of emotions if we take into\n392 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES account the possibly universal experiential basis of our emotion concepts, the con- ceptualization of this experiential basis by means of conceptual metonymies, the con- ceptual metaphors that often derive from these metonymies, and the broader cultural context. The central conceptual metaphor in the case of anger is the PRESSURIZED CON- TAINER metaphor (and the generic FORCE metaphor for the emotions in general; see K¨ovecses, 2000b), but other domains, such as human relationships, would be structured by other central or “master” metaphors. We should of course not imagine the process of the emergence of cultural mod- els in sequential steps, going from expe- riential basis to cultural model. A proba- bly more adequate way of thinking about it would be to say that the components I outlined here are all at work at the same time, mutually inﬂuencing each other. In the course of this joint evolution, the concep- tualized experiential basis (often appearing as conceptual metonymies) and the emerg- ing conceptual metaphors contribute to the basic schematic structure of the cultural model, while the simultaneously present cultural context ﬂeshes out the details of the schema. (6) Are Emotion Concepts and Emotion Metaphors Universal? It might seem in light of what was said in the previous section that I am suggesting that emotion concepts and metaphors are in gen- eral universal. Although we ﬁnd a great deal of commonality in emotion concepts and metaphors both across languages/cultures and through time (see K¨ovecses, 2005), we can see a great deal of variation as well. The interesting question is, How does this variation come about if emotion concepts and metaphors are embodied in universal human experience? I will discuss three pos- sible reasons for this (based on K¨ovecses, 2005). Variation as a result of differential framing Let us take lust, or sexual desire, as an exam- ple. In English, the concept is commonly conceptualized as heat (of ﬁre) (K¨ovecses, 1988; Lakoff, 1987). This gives rise to such conventionalized expressions as the following: She’s burning with desire. I’ve got the hots for her. He’s on ﬁre for her. The linguistic examples of the LUST IS HEAT metaphor are based on the mappings below: The thing that is hot (from ﬁre) →the lustful person The heat →the lust The degree of the heat →the intensity of the lustful feeling These are the main mappings that charac- terize the metaphor as it is used in English. In the metaphor, both the lust of the lustful person and that of the person who is lusted after can be viewed as hot. The degree of the heat indicates the intensity of the sexual desire on the part of either person. In contrast, in Chagga, an African lan- guage spoken in Tanzania, the LUST IS HEAT metaphor is understood differently (Emana- tian, 1995). Consider the following examples taken from Emanatian: Nke´oka “She roasts.” N´ekeha “She burns.” As can be seen, all three examples are about women. The meaning of the expressions is given by Emanatian as “She is sexually desir- able.” This contrasts markedly with English where a similar expression involving intense heat would mean something like “She has intense feelings of lust.” The next Chagga example does not indicate intense sexual desire either, as a corresponding English expression would, but again sexually desir- able qualities:\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 393 N´awor´e ‘´ushangu lo m´oro “She has a ‘heaven’ of ﬁre.” She has desirable sexual attributes (skills, natural endowments, interests) The lack of these qualities is expressed by the notion of coldness: Kyam´uya rik´o lilya “She’s cold.” She lacks desirable sexual attributes. What is particularly interesting about these examples is that the SEX IS HEAT metaphor, though it employs the same source domain as the corresponding English metaphor, pro- vides a differential perspective on sexu- ality in comparison to English: The tar- get domain to which it applies is slightly changed (it involves male sexuality only) and the source domain is employed differ- ently in Chagga than in English. In other words, the domain of sexuality is framed differentially in the two languages despite the same source domain that is employed. To see the exact details of this, here are the mappings of the Chagga SEX IS HEAT metaphor: the thing/substance burning →the woman with the desirable sexual qualities warmth or heat of the thing/substance → desirable sexual qualities of a person the person who observes the burning thing → the man who ﬁnds a woman sexually desir- able Thus, we ﬁnd that differences in the English and Chagga mappings for roughly corre- sponding metaphors (SEXUAL DESIRE IS HEAT and SEX IS HEAT) result from differen- tial framings in both the source and the tar- get domains. This is remarkable because the same universal physiology seems to support roughly the same metaphor in two cultures with the source and target being framed dif- ferently in the two languages. Variation as a result of differential experiential focus The notion of “experiential focus” is intended to be a general explanation of why even highly embodied metaphors may vary across languages and time (K¨ovecses, 2005). The basic idea is this: Embodiment may con- sist of a variety of aspects, or components, and any of these may become the preferred one in a given culture and at a given time. Which aspect(s), or component(s), of (otherwise) universal embodiment receive(s) more attention from speakers of a language largely depends on the broader cultural context. A case in point is the conceptualization of anger in English and Chinese. As studies of the physiology of anger across several unre- lated cultures show, increase in skin temper- ature and blood pressure are universal physi- ological correlates of anger. This accounts for the ANGER IS HEAT metaphor in English and in many other languages. However, King’s (1989) and Yu’s (1995, 1998) work suggest that the conceptualization of anger in terms of heat is much less prevalent in Chinese than it is in English. In Chinese, the major metaphors of anger seem to be based on pressure, not on pressure and heat. This indi- cates that speakers of Chinese have relied on a different aspect of their physiology in the metaphorical conceptualization of anger than speakers of English. The major point is that in many cases the universality of expe- riential basis does not necessarily lead to universally equivalent conceptualization— at least not at the speciﬁc level of hot ﬂuids, in the case of anger. Another example of how different cul- tures utilize a presumably universal bodily basis in anger is offered by Michelle Rosaldo in her description of Ilongot anger (Rosaldo, 1980). The Ilongot are a former headhunt- ing tribe living in Northern Luzon, Philip- pines. For young Ilongot men, anger, liget, is a highly energized state that they need in order to successfully accomplish their headhunting raids. In Rosaldo’s words: “The liget that Ilongots associate with youthful prowess and, for them, with the universal agitation that makes young men want to kill, takes on reality and signiﬁcance because it is bound up not in mystery or cosmol- ogy, but in three forms of relation central to Ilongot social life” (Rosaldo, 1980, 138).\n394 ZOLT ´AN K ¨OVECSES Indeed, Rosaldo glosses the Ilongot term for anger as “energy/anger.” This suggests that for the Ilongot anger (liget) ﬁgures as a generalized state of arousal that can suf- ﬁciently motivate their actions. They think of their anger also as hot but, most impor- tantly, as an agitated and energized state that makes them want to go out and take heads. Clearly, this is, for us, a surprisingly differ- ent way of building on our presumably uni- versal bodily experience in conceptualizing anger. Finally, there may be cultures where people clearly have a universal physiologi- cal component, and yet the conceptualiza- tion of anger or other emotion concepts is only marginally based on metaphors or metonymies. One such language is Tsou (an Austronesian language spoken in parts of Taiwan), where the emotions are primarily expressed linguistically through an elaborate preﬁx system attached to emotion verbs (not nouns). But as Shuanfan Huang (2002), the linguist who studied the language, tells us even in this language there exists the con- ceptual metaphor ANGER IS EXCESS AIR or FIRE IN A CONTAINER. Variation as a result of differential experiential focus through time Let us now consider how historical change may inﬂuence which metaphors are used in a particular language. We can start the discussion of this issue with the following question: Do cognitive linguists suggest that universal embodiment necessarily leads to the same application of a source domain to a particular target through time? Work by Caroline Gevaert (2001) demonstrates that the conceptualization of anger changed considerably from the Old English to the Middle English period. On the basis of a variety of corpora, she showed that heat- related words account for only 1.59% of all the words describing anger before 850. The number of heat-related words for anger dra- matically increases in the period between 850 and 950. Then the number of these words decreases between 950 and 1050 to 6.22% and then to 1.71% by around 1,200, and then to 0.27% by around 1300. After 1300, the number starts growing again, and after 1400, it becomes dominant in texts that describe anger. As has been noticed in previ- ous work (see, e.g., K¨ovecses, 1986; Lakoff, 1987; Lakoff & K¨ovecses, 1987), heat-related words account for a large portion of all the expressions that are used to talk about anger in present-day English. What do Gevaert’s ﬁndings tell us then? Her ﬁndings indicate that the conceptual- ization of anger in terms of heat is not a permanent feature of the concept of anger in English, but that it can, and does, ﬂuc- tuate in the course of the development of English. This is an extremely important ﬁnd- ing because it bears directly on the issue of universality of metaphorical conceptualiza- tion across time. If the conceptualization of anger in terms of heat is a mechanical or automatic consequence of our real physi- ology in anger, this ﬂuctuation should not occur. It cannot be the case that people’s physiology changes in anger every one or two hundred years or so. How can we account for this ﬂuctuation then? Is there an answer that is consistent both with the cognitive linguis- tic view of embodiment and with the obvi- ous changes in conceptualization of anger through time? I believe the answer is that univer- sal physiology provides only a potential basis for metaphorical conceptualization— without mechanically constraining what the speciﬁc metaphors for anger will be. Heat was a major component in the concept of anger between 850 and 950, and then after a long decline, it began to play a key role again at around 1400—possibly as a result of the emergence of the humoral view of emotions in Europe (see Geeraerts & Gron- delaers, 1995; Gevaert, 2001, 2005). We can notice the same kind of ﬂuctuation in the use of the domain of “swell,” which I take to be akin to what we call the “pressure” compo- nent in the conceptualization of anger today. Pressure was a major part of the concep- tualization of anger until around 1300, but then it began to decline, only to emerge strongly again, together with heat, in the form of the HOT FLUID IN A CONTAINER\nMETAPHOR AND EMOTION 395 metaphor centuries later. The point is that we should not expect any of the conceptualized responses associated with anger to remain constant in conceptualiz- ing anger (and the emotions in general) throughout the ages. Experiential focus may change across time even within the same language. More generally, what I would like to emphasize here is that universal embodi- ment associated with a target domain may consist of several distinct components, or aspects. The conceptual metaphors that emerge may be based on one component, or aspect, at a certain point of time and on another at another point of time. Which one is chosen depends on a variety of factors in the surrounding cultural context. Moreover, the conceptual metaphors may be based on one component, or aspect, in one culture, while on another component, or aspect, in another culture. Conclusions There are two conclusions I wish to high- light. First, emotion metaphors largely fall under the generic-level metaphor: CAUSES ARE FORCES. The still generic-level instance of this metaphor is EMOTIONS ARE FORCES. Such generic force metaphors can be described by means of Talmy’s force dynam- ics and apply to many domains outside emo- tion. In this sense, there are no emotion- speciﬁc metaphors that are of major signiﬁ- cance in the conceptualization of emotions. The speciﬁc source domains of OPPONENT, NATURAL FORCE, CAPTIVE ANIMAL, HEAT, and so on apply to a much wider range of tar- get concepts in the conceptual system. This suggests a hierarchical organization for how we make use of metaphorical conceptual- ization. Such an organization can take the form of either generic to speciﬁc within a single hierarchy (which seems to be the case for emotion) or generic to speciﬁc in a num- ber of different hierarchies (which seems to be the case for friendship). Second, I suggest that despite the universality of bodily expe- rience on which many of our more speciﬁc emotion metaphors (such as LUST IS HEAT and THE ANGRY PERSON IS A PRESSUR- IZED CONTAINER) are based, we get a large amount of nonuniversality in the metaphor- ical conceptualization of emotion. This is because either the framing or the experien- tial focus of the source domains may vary from culture to culture. References Baxter, L. A. (1992).

McMullen Much Is Made of Metaphor, and Little Has Been Learned Such might be a pithy evaluation of what are, for the most part, two parallel litera- tures on the use of metaphor in psychother- apy. On the one hand, there is a con- ceptual or theory-based, practice-oriented literature directed at therapists and that is primarily focussed on articulating presumed functions of metaphor in psychotherapy and on ways for therapists to make deliberate use of metaphor. This literature is often ﬁlled with directives for therapists as to how to employ metaphors, with case examples illus- trating the use of metaphors, with exam- ples of problem-targeted metaphors that are embedded in narratives, and with bold claims as to the effectiveness of metaphors in promoting client change. In this litera- ture, there is an assumption that the func- tions of metaphor are isomorphic with the goals of psychotherapy; hence, the appropri- ate and strategic use of metaphor is claimed to advance the aims of therapy. Much is made of metaphor. On the other hand, there is an empiri- cal literature that is typically focussed on either the client’s use of metaphor or the joint use by client and therapist. Some of this literature is based on quantitative analyses, and some on qualitative analyses. As with the conceptual or theory-based, practice-oriented literature, the focus is on explicating how the use of metaphor in psychotherapy is related to outcome or to important aspects of the process of therapy. However, in the empirical literature, which is quite small in comparison to the concep- tual or theory-based, practice-oriented liter- ature, different questions are asked, different deﬁnitions are used, and different methods are employed across studies, and, typically, the ﬁndings are rather disappointing in the sense that predictions are not conﬁrmed or the evidence is not particularly convincing. As there is no replication of studies or even little use of common research strategies from one study to the next, claims are sometimes contradictory or tied too speciﬁcally to the study to be of much value. It would not be unreasonable for a reader of this literature 397\n398 LINDA M. MCMULLEN to conclude that the empirical investigation of metaphor use in psychotherapy, particu- larly in terms of its relation to outcome, is either too difﬁcult or misguided. Little has been learned. In this chapter, I consider two questions. First, what leads writers in this area to attribute such power to metaphor? Second, what is it about the empirical investigation of metaphor use in psychotherapy that has resulted in a rather limited advancement of knowledge? In addressing these two ques- tions, I argue that the practice of isolating metaphors for special consideration, of fail- ing to analyse the conversational exchanges and cultural discourses of which they are a part, and of ignoring the situated nature of psychotherapy has led to claims that are unwarranted or trite. I suggest that we need more seriously to take context into account in both our conceptual or theory- based writings and in our empirical inves- tigations in order to understand more fully what participants in psychotherapy do with metaphors. The Power of Metaphor Psychotherapy is considered a particularly fertile space for the study of metaphor and other forms of ﬁgurative language (e.g., sim- ile, personiﬁcation, hyperbole).1 With its reliance on the exchange of words between a client and a therapist, this form of inter- vention (at least as it is typically prac- tised in most westernized contexts) is a site that demands the use of words to accom- plish various actions, usually conceptual- ized in terms of a facilitation of change in the client through the mutual work of the client and the therapist. Such work often involves the use of new words or the devel- opment of familiar words in new ways, and, as such, metaphors – both conventional and novel instances – typically abound in this context. Beginning with some of the earliest writ- ings on the functions of metaphors in psy- chotherapy, much has been claimed with regard to the power of metaphor in the work of psychotherapy. Lenrow (1966) out- lined several functions served by metaphors, including referring to and highlighting sub- tle social roles that a client takes, simplify- ing events in a way that allows certain ele- ments to be emphasized more than others, fostering a climate that permits therapists to communicate about intimate characteristics of the client in a non-intrusive way, and pro- viding a model of trying out new ways of understanding that can be applied to future situations. Fine, Pollio, and Simpkinson (1973), in building on the functions artic- ulated by Lenrow (1966), emphasized the capacity of metaphor (and other forms of ﬁgurative language) for enabling clients to express what has previously been inexpress- ible, to ﬁll the gap between what they are able to communicate about how they feel and what they may be actually experienc- ing. To illustrate their point, Fine et al. pro- vided the example of a client who, in trying to communicate a puzzling sensation to her therapist, said that her “heart was a basket- ball being bounced up and down” (p. 89). Using this metaphor elicited a response from the therapist that communicated a recogni- tion of the fear of having something that big inside him whose movement was not under his control, a response which, according to Fine et al., was received by the client as empathic and understanding. Going beyond the expressive and com- municative functions of metaphor, Pollio, Barlow, Fine, and Pollio (1977) focussed on how employing novel metaphors to talk about problems in a new and unusual way can serve to make explicit what has pre- viously been implicit, thereby facilitating problem description and resolution, and Barlow, Pollio, and Fine (1977) alluded to how a therapist’s use of the client’s metaphors can both ease the tension and anxiety common to therapy and facilitate problem solving. As support for their argu- ment, Barlow et al. illustrated how a client and a therapist delicately embraced the dif- ﬁcult topic of the client’s anger and impo- tence through a series of new and elabo- rated metaphors. In part of their illustrative excerpt, the client used the metaphor of\nPUTTING IT IN CONTEXT 399 wearing “a white hat,” which was a ref- erence to his self-presentation as a helper and rescuer and then subsequently elabo- rated this metaphor by saying that “the white hat” has “sort of turned gray” and is get- ting “a little dirty” (p. 216) which was under- stood as an acknowledgement that, at times, he is not nice. In response, the therapist introduced the notion of the client being afraid that “an angry monster” would be exposed if the “white hat” were taken off, to which the client, in turn, responded with the metaphor of “the mouse that roared,” a well-formed ﬁgure that was thought to tap into a sense of his own ineffectualness. Barlow et al. interpreted this sequence as evidence of how metaphors are implicated in the disclosure of revealing material, in the articulation of problems, and in the develop- ment of insight. This focus on the power of metaphor to facilitate the work of psychotherapy con- tinues in the literature 25–35 years after the appearance of these early articles. In a paper published in 1995, Cirillo and Crider outlined what they considered to be four varieties of metaphorical communication: (1) making a point vividly with an implied comparison, for example, referring to a family member as “a bulldog” as a way of capturing his or her stubbornly deter- mined behaviour; (2) accommodating dis- parate interests through multiple meanings, for example, describing a relationship as “a tennis match” as a way of capturing both its competitive nature and the opportuni- ties it provides for achievement and mastery; (3) changing perspectives on a topic with borrowed terminology, for example, a ther- apist fashioning a metaphor from something a client previously said in order to draw an analogy about a current situation; and (4) using a novel combination to create or reveal something new, for example, imag- ining oneself as the various features of a rosebush as a way of exploring rejected or unknown aspects of the self. They linked these four varieties to speciﬁc therapeutic aims, such as capturing complex emotional themes in concise and memorable ways, uniting diverse intentions and bridging dis- parate conﬂicting interests of individuals or groups, reframing problems, and discovering new possibilities for feelings and behaviour. Similarly, Lyddon, Clay, and Sparks (2001) claimed that metaphors can play a sig- niﬁcant role in facilitating at least ﬁve devel- opmental change processes: (1) by being sensitive to a client’s metaphors, a thera- pist can convey understanding of the client’s ways of knowing and can contribute to the development of a shared language and col- laborative relationship; (2) by symbolizing emotions that have been previously unex- pressed, unexplored, or unrecognized, the use of metaphors can assist clients in con- structing new personal meanings of their experience; (3) because metaphors can high- light and make vivid that which has previ- ously been unspoken and unexplored, they can assist in uncovering and challenging tacit assumptions; (4) metaphors may enable clients to access new information about themselves in indirect ways, and may assist therapists in helping clients to express and examine painful feelings and experiences in a manner that minimizes resistance; and (5) metaphors might serve as devices for dis- covery by facilitating the client’s awareness of previously unknown aspects of the self or of the self’s relationships with others, and by creating new possibilities for action. In this literature, claims about metaphor are aligned with a common view of lan- guage and its power. Speciﬁcally, as noted by Guerin (2003), “that what language does is to refer, represent, communicate, or express and that the power of language to do these things is somehow contained in the words themselves” (p. 251). In the context of psy- chotherapy, metaphors are thought to refer to views of the self and others, to the social roles enacted by clients and others, to ways of thinking and feeling, and to the cen- tral problems in the client’s life. Similarly, they are thought to represent or symbolize emotions, tacit assumptions, and less-than- conscious experiences. Because of their sym- bolic nature, metaphors are also claimed both to assist clients in being able to express that which is difﬁcult to put into words and to speak, and to enable therapists to\n400 LINDA M. MCMULLEN say that which might be difﬁcult for clients to hear. The referential, representational, and expressive capacities of metaphors are thought further to promote communication between client and therapist as they assist in the development of a shared language over the course of therapy. According to these claims, much can be accomplished with metaphors. In essence, metaphors can assist all of the work of psy- chotherapy. They can provide information about the client, can foster a collaborative relationship between the client and the ther- apist, and can facilitate new ways of talking, thinking, and understanding. Similar claims are made in the practice- oriented literature, although in some instances the power of metaphor is stated even more explicitly and strongly. This lite- rature spans a variety of theoretical perspec- tives, including cognitive therapy (Muran & DiGiuseppi, 1990), depth psychotherapy (particularly, Jungian and psychoanalytic perspectives; Kopp, 1995; Siegelman, 1990), strategic therapy (Haley, 1973), and Erick- sonian psychotherapy (e.g., Close, 1998; Combs & Freedman, 1990; Pearce, 1996), with the bulk of the writings based in depth psychology and Ericksonian principles. The focus on the power of metaphor in the tradition of depth psychology has typically been framed in terms of how metaphor makes possible the communi- cation and interpretation of unconscious meaning (Arlow, 1979). In some early writ- ings, Ekstein and colleagues (as cited in Arlow, 1979) claimed that the use of metaphor enabled patients (primarily those labelled borderline or psychotic) to main- tain a distance from anxiety-provoking con- tent, and that the therapist’s subsequent use of the patient’s metaphors in the interpre- tation of the patient’s conﬂict would pre- vent the patient from experiencing severe anxiety or panic. While other writers (e.g., Forrest, 1973) also emphasized the capac- ity of metaphor to reveal the nature of a patient’s character structure and defences as well as his or her unconscious fantasies, some (e.g., Wright, 1976) claimed that metaphor reveals the ego in its creative operations, integrates the conscious and the uncon- scious, and leads to a new vision. More recent writings in this tradition have emphasized not only the capacity of metaphor both to reveal and to protect, and to join the new with the unknown, but also its unique utility for communicat- ing emotions and other sensorimotor states and for enabling interpersonal connection. One of Siegelman’s (1990) primary claims is that “affect and metaphor are closely con- nected” (p. 6), and that clients often make use of metaphors and other forms of ﬁgu- rative language when they want to convey strong affect that cannot be easily commu- nicated in other ways. For example, in trying to capture the physical sensations and inter- personal consequences of an expression of anger, a client might say, “I stab people with my voice.” If a therapist is able to stay with such metaphors and encourage the client to explore them, the client’s level of experienc- ing and the potential for insight are believed to expand. Similarly, Kopp (1995) claimed that when therapists encourage clients to stay with their own metaphors and expand and elaborate them, clients will be moved to deeper levels of experiencing and will gain meaning and insight. Vivona (2003) added another element to this possibility by claiming that metaphors not only embrace and bridge verbal and sensorimotor expe- rience but also allow the client and the therapist to embrace each other, thereby enabling interpersonal as well as intrapsy- chic connection. In a detailed account of her work with a female client in psy- chotherapy, Vivona (2003) illustrated how the client’s metaphor that others expected her to be “a doll with no insides” provided a means for linking her bodily act of wrist- cutting with her desire to show her thera- pist what was inside her. Building on this metaphor, Vivona’s empathic articulation of her own decision not to look at her client’s wounded wrist (It’s “as though I don’t want to see your insides”) and her subsequent expression of her client’s disappointment at not being physically touched by her (“The touch of words is not the same as the touch of hands”) was understood as a joint\nPUTTING IT IN CONTEXT 401 experience of the power and limitations of their relationship. Although depth psychology theorists typ- ically emphasize what can be learned from the content of client-generated metaphors and how the therapist’s careful work within these metaphors can lead to change [see Kopp (1995) and Siegelman (1990) in par- ticular], theorists and practitioners who base their work on the principles articu- lated by Milton Erickson typically empha- size the strategic use of therapist-generated metaphors. In this literature, the power of metaphor is claimed to lie in its capac- ity for indirect communication, or what Barker (1996) labelled “outﬂanking maneu- vers” (p. 14). For example, Combs and Freed- man (1990) maintained that interacting with clients in metaphor allows the therapist to gather information indirectly, thereby avoid- ing much of the awkwardness and defen- siveness that can occur when information about sensitive issues is asked for directly. In addition, they claimed that the indirec- tion of metaphor allows therapists to embed new ideas and suggestions for future action in a way that permits clients to try new pat- terns of thinking, feeling, and behaving with- out having to commit consciously or openly to them. For instance, in working toward a goal of changing a client’s approach to sexuality from being a self-absorbed perfor- mance to involving sensitivity and accom- modation to a partner, a therapist might intersperse suggestions about sex in discus- sions with the client about another “love” of his life – woodworking – that does, in fact, engender expressions of tenderness and caring. Other writers in this tradition are more graphic and expansive in their claims of what metaphor can do. For Barker (1996), metaphor “may serve to enrich virtually any communication process” (p. 23), and, according to Pearce (1996), “is worth hours of conversation in uncovering the client’s past” (p. 10), “liberates both client and ther- apist from preconceived notions” (p. 5), and “permeates, facilitates, and, in some ways, redeﬁnes the client-therapist relationship” (p. 6). A large literature exists in the Erick- sonian tradition in which the construc- tion and delivery of therapeutic metaphors is detailed. In much of this literature, metaphors are situated within narratives. Some writers stop short of specifying the content of therapeutic metaphor and pre- fer, instead, to outline basic principles of the construction of metaphors. For exam- ple, Barker (1996) maintained that it is important to consider the social, cultural, and vocational background of the client in determining the content of a metaphor, but also claimed that in designing and using a metaphor, the therapist should take into account the language style, vocabulary, and primary sensory channels used by the client in processing information. Noting whether the client uses visual (e.g., “I see what you mean”), auditory (e.g., “That sounds pretty bad”), or kinaesthetic predicates (e.g., “That feels about right”) and responding with sim- ilar language is proposed as potentially being helpful. Barker further claimed that the suc- cessful delivery of a metaphor whose con- tent and form are designed for a particular client is dependent on such prerequisites as an adequate level of rapport between thera- pist and client, preparation of and agreement by the client for the use of such an approach, the establishment of agreed upon goals for therapy, conﬁdence in the use of metaphor on the part of the therapist, and good timing and pacing. Other writers go further and not only specify the techniques for implementing a metaphor but provide an anthology of thera- peutic narratives directed at particular prob- lems. Pearce (1996) listed several considera- tions that he claimed should be taken into account in the therapeutic use of metaphor, including identifying the repetitive and self- defeating nature of the client’s problem, the choice of sensory modality in which the metaphor should be delivered, the cadence and tone that should be used, the delib- erate interspersing of focussed words (e.g., the client’s name), embedding commands in a way that focuses the client’s atten- tion, and avoiding explanation. He then provided a compendium of narratives that\n402 LINDA M. MCMULLEN provides practitioners with a thematic inventory of metaphoric material to use in various situations. Similarly, Burns (2001) constructed an entire book of stories that are oriented to particular problems experienced by clients (e.g., fear, anger, uncertainty, rela- tionship difﬁculties, loss, inferiority) and to particular desired outcomes (e.g., empower- ment, acceptance, learning from experience, attaining goals, engaging in self-care, expe- riencing happiness). Although Burns (2001) cautioned against a verbatim, prescriptive, ﬁxed, and universal use of these metaphoric stories, he nevertheless suggested that they might provide useful themes for future work with clients, and provided guidelines for therapists to employ in developing and administering their own metaphors. Like those writers who make claims about the functions of metaphors, writers who direct their work primarily to practitioners adopt a model of language that is focussed on its referential, representational, expres- sive, and communicative power. Some of these writers also emphasize the determina- tive power of language. For example, Siegel- man (1990) claimed that metaphors “not only reﬂect past experience but also become ﬁlters that regulate how we see our present experience and how we project our future” (p. 65). Others (e.g., Barker, 1996; Pearce, 1996) have claimed that metaphors are indi- rect strategies for getting clients to do things. Regardless, it is still the metaphor, itself, – its content and its production – that is a source of power. There is much about the enterprise of psychotherapy and about metaphor that conspires to support such a position. Psy- chotherapy has historically been known as the “talking cure.” Typically, clients are thought to reveal important aspects of them- selves, and therapists are thought to be able to affect change in clients, through what is said and how something is said. The con- tent and form or style of client and therapist language is, then, thought to be the heart of most types of psychotherapy. As Russell (1987) stated, “the identiﬁcation of what is said in psychotherapy with what is done in psychotherapy” (p. 1) is commonplace. Having established the use of language as pre-eminent in the work of psychother- apy, the question becomes, “What is it about metaphor, speciﬁcally, that enables so much to be claimed?” Consistent with theses developed by scholars of metaphor (see Tilley, 1999), writers in this area have focussed on the expressibility, vividness, and compactness of metaphor. For some (e.g., Sunderland, 1997–98), it is the symbolism and imagery of metaphor that gives it power, particularly in the sense of enabling the imagination to be put into action (Tilley, 1999). For others (e.g., Martin, Cummings, & Hallberg, 1992), it is its concrete, graphic nature, its potential to draw attention to itself, to stand out and be memorable. And for others (e.g., Pearce, 1996), it is its dual capacity for compact, concise communica- tion and for multiple meanings and inter- pretations. Given the nature and scope of metaphor, it becomes possible (and perhaps even easy) to make claims about how it functions to further the work of psychother- apy, as is particularly evident in the work of Cirillo and Crider (1995) and Lyddon et al. (2001). The weakness in these writings is not that writers have categorically extolled the power of metaphor. Indeed, many (see, for example, Burns, 2001; Siegelman, 1990) have urged psychotherapists against an overly zealous and rigid approach to working with clients’ metaphors or to developing their own metaphors, and have underscored that metaphors are just one form of communi- cation to be attended to in psychotherapy. What is problematic is that by focussing on the referential, representational, expres- sive, communicative, and even determina- tive power of metaphors, what is said and how it is said have too often not been adequately situated. In essence, a focus on words has taken precedence over a focus on talk and, in particular, on talk as a form of situated action. Not focussing on what metaphor is actually accomplishing in a particular client–therapist conversation can consequently result in claims about the func- tions of metaphors that are not adequately grounded in evidence.\nPUTTING IT IN CONTEXT 403 In line with this focus on the content and form of metaphor, the evidence that is presented to support the claims about the power of metaphor often consists of a sum- marized account of the client’s and thera- pist’s use of a particular metaphor, coupled with brief fragments of actual client and therapist talk, or a metaphorical story that serves to illustrate how a problem might be approached. What is not adequately avail- able and rarely, if ever, analysed are the con- texts in which the use of metaphor in psy- chotherapy is situated. Speciﬁcally, we typically do not ask the following kinds of questions: (1) How does the enterprise and practice of psychother- apy, as situated in a particular historical, cul- tural, and social context, inﬂuence a client’s and a therapist’s choice of and engage- ment with metaphors? For example, I have found that metaphors of the self as hos- tile and submissive (e.g., “I’m weak,” “I’m down,” “I caved in,” “I put up walls”) and of others as hostile (e.g., “He’s cold,” “She lashed out,” “He jumped on me”) are par- ticularly prominent in psychotherapy as it is typically practised in contemporary west- ern societies, i.e., on an outpatient basis with persons experiencing problems related to autonomy and intimacy. However, how these problems are addressed (e.g., by dream work, homework assignments, gender anal- ysis) and how the corresponding metaphors are attended to and taken up might differ depending on the theoretical orientation of the therapist (e.g., psychoanalytic, cognitive- behavioural, feminist), the time frame of the therapy (e.g., open-ended vs. time-limited), and the participants’ willingness to engage with metaphors. Who participates in which sanctioned activities for what purposes are features of context that should receive atten- tion in our investigations. (2) When a par- ticular metaphor is used, how is it received, and how is it further shaped by its effects on the listener? For example, does the therapist ask for elaboration of a particularly evocative metaphor produced by a client (e.g., “What do you mean when you say you put your- self out in the ﬁring line and are shot down by people?”), or does he or she ignore the metaphor or use it as a stimulus for resist- ing the client’s presentation (e.g., “Maybe you get a thrill by being in the ﬁring line”)? (3) How does metaphor work in conjunc- tion with other rhetorical devices to achieve particular ends? For example, consider the potential for misunderstanding when the metaphoric phrase “My mother’s a saint” is stripped of factual and intonational details and taken at face value, rather than under- stood as an expression of sarcasm. With- out a more detailed and nuanced analysis of metaphor in context, this area of study runs the risk of being plagued by what Guerin (2003) has deemed “misleading, tautologi- cal, and vacuous theorizing” (p. 251). Having drawn attention to the use of metaphor in psychotherapy as an area worthy of study is a potentially important move on the part of past contributors. However, to move beyond the tautological stance that “metaphor is important in psychotherapy because it pro- motes the goals of therapy,” a different posi- tion is now needed. The Limits of Metaphor Research Empirical research on metaphor and psy- chotherapy has been guided, for the most part, by broad questions about how the con- tent and use of metaphor facilitate the pro- cess of psychotherapy and/or are related to the eventual outcome of the therapy. Except for those studies in which data from post-session inquiry interviews were anal- ysed (e.g., Angus & Rennie, 1988, 1989; Ras- mussen, 2000; Rasmussen & Angus, 1996), this research almost exclusively entails the analysis of metaphors used in actual sessions of psychoanalytically oriented, psychody- namic, Gestalt, or process-experiential psy- chotherapy [see Martin et al. (1992) for an exception]. The accumulated ﬁndings of this research underscore the highly contextualized nature of metaphor use. Some studies have been based, in part, on rates of production of metaphors (and other forms of ﬁgura- tive language) and/or on the distinction between novel and frozen metaphors, with\n404 LINDA M. MCMULLEN an assumption that novel metaphors do the work in psychotherapy. These studies have shown that overall use of metaphors varies across clients, therapists, and ses- sions, and is not consistently related to out- come. For example, in the analysis of a single, highly successful case of Gestalt ther- apy, Pollio and Barlow (1975) found that the client used more instances of ﬁgurative lan- guage than did the therapist; Hill and Regan (1991) also reported that, across eight cases of brief psychotherapy, clients used more metaphors than therapists. In a compari- son of the use of novel ﬁgurative language (mainly metaphors) over the ﬁrst two, mid- dle two, and last two sessions of one success- ful and one unsuccessful case of psychother- apy, I found that, regardless of outcome, the therapists’ use of novel ﬁgures (e.g., “You could bottle your anger forever until it becomes a ﬁne old wine”) was higher than that of the client (McMullen, 1985). Con- trary to expectation, Angus (1996) reported that clients and therapists in three good out- come cases of brief dynamic psychother- apy produced proportionally fewer novel metaphors than their counterparts in poor outcome cases. In contrast, Amira (1982) found that rate of production of novel ﬁgures failed to discriminate successful from unsuc- cessful cases of psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy. Research focussed on whether and how clients and therapists make use of each other’s metaphors has also revealed signif- icant variability in such usage. In addition, in many of the cases that appear in the literature, sharing or co-elaboration of a metaphor was not very common and was not necessarily found to be a marker of the kind of therapy process that is thought to produce change. For example, Hill and Regan (1991) reported that in their single- case study of a client and a therapist who used a large number of metaphors, the client repeated only 3% of therapist-introduced metaphors within the same session, while the therapist repeated 13% of client- introduced metaphors. Similarly, I found the extent to which clients in successful cases “took up” therapist-introduced instances of ﬁgurative language (e.g., “You’ve got your- self in an emotional stranglehold”) to be minimal in an absolute sense (McMullen, 1985, 1989). In terms of outcome compar- isons, I found a successful and an unsuc- cessful case of psychotherapy to be differ- entiated by the extent to which the client repeated more instances of ﬁgurative lan- guage introduced by the therapist versus self-introduced ﬁgures (McMullen, 1985). Speciﬁcally, the client with the unsuccess- ful outcome repeated more of her own ﬁg- ures (e.g., “Women can be ballsy”), while the client with the successful outcome repeated ﬁgures originally introduced by the therapist (e.g., “I don’t want to be numbed”). Alterna- tively, I found other cases of successful and unsuccessful psychotherapy to be similar in that the clients consistently used many more of their own ﬁgures (e.g., “I’ve been burned by others,” “I’m the trophy of the rhinoceros you put on your mantle,” “I’m balking in life,” “My ﬁanc´ee’s pulling a good-sized net around me”) than therapist-introduced ﬁg- ures (McMullen, 1989). Typically, this way of analysing how metaphors are employed has not revealed differences in therapists’ use in relation to therapy outcome. Speciﬁcally, therapists have been found to use their own and the clients’ ﬁgures to roughly the same extent or to repeat and elaborate their own ﬁgures (McMullen, 1985, 1989). Although extended bursts of the use of ﬁgurative language by clients have been found to relate to problem setting and prob- lem solving (Pollio & Barlow, 1975), it is also clear that the repeated use and/or elab- oration of a particular metaphor within a particular session does not always signal a productive process. From a study in which clients and therapists were asked to recall their thoughts and feelings during times when a metaphor was used in a recently conducted session of psychotherapy, Angus and Rennie (1988) constructed two pat- terns of metaphoric communication: one that was labelled “meaning conjunction” and was associated with the development of a mutually shared understanding of the mean- ing of metaphor, and one that was labelled “meaning disjunction” and was associated\nPUTTING IT IN CONTEXT 405 with a joint misunderstanding of the mean- ing of a metaphor. In the former, the thera- pist’s ﬁgurative elaboration of a client’s day- dream about destroying the therapist’s ofﬁce (i.e., “You act like a neglected child”) and his curiosity about the client’s associations to it seemed to signal a mutual understanding and to open up new ways for the client to appre- ciate the metaphor. In the latter, the ther- apist’s repeated engagement with a client’s metaphor (e.g., “an ogre”) was much like a Socratic dialogue (e.g., “Do you see how it seems to be like it’s either you act [like a good guy] or you’re an ogre?”), and appeared to be designed to inﬂuence the client to iden- tify what the therapist had already decided was the “true” way to understand what was being talked about. Similarly, Rasmussen and Angus (1996) constructed two core categories from an analysis of post-session inquiry interviews focussed on metaphor sequences in single sessions of psychoanalytically oriented psy- chotherapy (two with clients labelled as borderline and two with clients labelled non-borderline). One category, which was termed a “representational mode of interac- tion” and was characteristic of dyads with the non-borderline clients, involved the use of metaphors whose meanings were previ- ously negotiated by the client and the thera- pist and contributed to a shared therapeu- tic vocabulary. The other category which was termed a “literal mode of interaction” and was characteristic of dyads with the clients labelled as borderline involved the use of metaphors whose meanings had not been previously negotiated and did not pro- vide stability or reﬂect a shared therapeu- tic vocabulary. A further analysis of the data generated from the inquiry into the use of metaphoric sequences by these therapists, however, revealed mixed results in terms of the impact of these sequences on the clients and on the therapeutic process (Rasmussen, 2000). In only one case of a client labelled as non-borderline was the therapist’s metaphor (“cut to the bone”) interpreted as empathi- cally resonating with the client’s experience of feeling raw and exposed over the loss of a relationship and as effectively communi- cating a sense of attunement. In the other three cases, the therapist’s metaphor was either not understood or was interpreted as failing to have the desired effect. For example, rather than leading to an exam- ination of the client–therapist relationship, a therapist’s query, “But have you ever felt kind of backed against the wall in here at all?” led the client to begin a conversation about issues of conﬁdentiality and proce- dures around record-keeping. Evidence that metaphor use is related both to what are considered productive and not-so-productive aspects of psychotherapy process is also found across other studies. For example, Pollio and Barlow (1975) and Pollio et al. (1977) reported that novel ﬁg- urative language co-occurred or alternated with expressions of insight on the part of the client, and Hill and Regan (1991) reported that the therapist’s use of metaphors co- occurred with his self-rated intention to encourage insight on the part of the client and to provide support to the client. Sim- ilarly, both Hill and Regan (1991) and Martin et al. (1992) found that thera- pists’ interventions involving metaphors were rated as more helpful by the partic- ipants than were other interventions. In a cross-case analysis of metaphors thought to be related to depression, Levitt, Korman, and Angus (2000) reported that, in compar- ison with the client in the poor outcome case, the client in the good outcome case had higher levels of experiencing when using metaphors of being “burdened.” However, Hill and Regan (1991) reported that, con- trary to expectation, the client in their study was rated at a lower level of experiencing when she was using metaphors (e.g., “I feel like jumping off a roof,” “I’m at rock bot- tom”) than when she was not. In a study focussed on the use of novel ﬁgures of speech in three sessions from each of seven cases of psychodynamic therapy, Stuart (1997) found that novel ﬁgures (e.g., “This man . . . and I got along like two strange bull dogs”) some- times accompanied increased experiencing on the part of the client, but most often coin- cided with decreasing experiencing. Both Hill and Regan (1991) and Stuart (1997)\n406 LINDA M. MCMULLEN interpreted their ﬁndings as indicating that some metaphors can be used for defensive purposes, that is, to avoid the expression of painful emotions or to “permit expression without full experiencing” (Stuart, 1997, p. 234). In general, a shift away from a straight- forward analysis of overall rates of produc- tion and shared usage, from distinctions of type (frozen versus novel) and from global predictions about metaphor use and therapy process variables in the empirical research, has been accompanied by a recognition that a focus on the analysis of therapy- relevant metaphors might be a productive line of investigation. Following from my own (McMullen, 1989) and others’ (Angus & Rennie, 1989) conclusions that metaphors of the self, of others, and of interpersonal relationships are central in psychotherapeu- tic talk, I used the interpersonal circum- plex (e.g., Kiesler, 1985; Leary, 1957) as a way of classifying clients’ metaphors of the self’s and others’ interpersonal actions. In an analysis of 21 cases of psychodynami- cally oriented psychotherapy, I found that the majority of clients in good outcome cases used metaphors that presented their own actions as friendly and dominant (e.g., “I’m a social animal,” “I stand up to others”), while the majority of clients in poor out- come cases used metaphors that presented their actions as submissive and hostile (e.g., “I’m a doormat,” “I exploded last night”) (McMullen & Conway, 1994). In addition, clients in these same outcome groupings were further differentiated on the basis of their use of what I called “metaphors of the self,” speciﬁcally, metaphors of being “frag- mented” versus being “together” or “whole.” Although all of these clients, regardless of outcome status, used metaphors that pre- sented the self as “fragmented” or as com- posed of “parts,” those clients who bene- ﬁted more from psychotherapy spoke of a misplaced, nascent, or wounded, but never- theless, existing or possible self (e.g., “I feel like I’ve lost [a] part of me,” “I think my scabs are in good order, but my scars are still sensitive”), while those clients who ben- eﬁted less presented metaphoric images of not being anchored in the self and of having repudiated certain parts of themselves to the point that these parts were constructed as unknown to, or deeply separate from, other parts (e.g., “I just really don’t know . . . how to ﬁnd myself,” “I’m a stranger to myself,” “I’m incomplete . . . parts of me that would contribute a wholeness are just blocked off”) (McMullen & Conway, 1996). Levitt et al. (2000) also reported that they were able to distinguish a good from a poor outcome case of process-experiential psychotherapy on the basis of how metaphors linked to depression were developed over the course of therapy. Speciﬁcally, in the good outcome case, metaphors of being “burdened” were transformed into metaphors of “unloading the burden,” while no such transformation was evident in the poor outcome case. The idea that an analysis of metaphors can capture the signiﬁcant themes in a particu- lar case of psychotherapy and can be used to chart the progress of psychotherapy has resulted in the development of new methods of analysis and in illustrative case studies. For example, Ingram (1994) developed a hier- archically structured method for analysing metaphoric content and themes and illus- trated how this structure could be used to identify speciﬁc functions of metaphors, such as serving as stages that lead the client to realize a central dilemma, explicating a central dilemma, and epitomizing the nature of the client’s conﬂict. By moving from a content area, through themes and higher- order themes, and eventually to a central theme, this hermeneutic method focuses the analysis both on what is talked about and on what the text (or psychotherapy tran- script) is about. In an analysis of a single session of psychoanalytic psychotherapy in which a client’s metaphors linked to being “my own prisoner” were prominent, Ingram (1994) illustrated how “signiﬁcant ﬁgures are those that encompass and explicate content areas, themes, and higher order themes that contribute to the central theme” (p. 284). In a similar but less structured way, Angus and colleagues (Angus, 1996; Angus & Kor- man, 2002) conducted intensive analyses of metaphors in which metaphor phrases from\nPUTTING IT IN CONTEXT 407 transcripts of psychotherapy sessions are identiﬁed and, on the basis of thematic simi- larities, sorted into clusters which are then organized into crosscutting thematic cate- gories. From the analysis of a single case of good outcome, brief dynamic psychotherapy (Angus, 1996), and from two good outcome cases of brief experiential psychotherapy (Angus & Korman, 2002), they concluded that a core set of metaphor themes predomi- nated in each case (primarily “RELATIONSHIP AS WAR OR CONFLICT”), that these themes evolved as therapy progressed, and that, in all themes, change occurred in a nonlinear, dialectical fashion in that clients tended to oscillate from one session to the next in their use of subcategories of the metaphor theme. What seems clear from nearly 30 years of research is that researchers have moved from a highly decontextualized approach to studying the use of metaphors in psychother- apy to a recognition that both what is said using metaphors and how it is said might be a more productive focus. I want to argue, how- ever, that this latter focus, in its present form, is also quite limiting. For example, estab- lishing that signiﬁcant or key metaphors are those that are related to, or contribute to, the development of a central theme in a particu- lar case of psychotherapy can be reduced to tautology in that the determination of what constitutes a central theme must inevitably be based on a consideration of both the lit- eral and the metaphoric language used by the client and the therapist. In addition, showing that the content of therapy-related or core metaphors can differentiate cases of poor outcome from those with good out- come and that this content can change over time perpetuates a narrow, decontextualized focus only on the referential and representa- tional aspects of language. Not only is this kind of analysis based on small fragments of metaphoric phrases extracted from a stream of client and therapist talk but also meaning is overshadowed by content. What is missing in these approaches is a recognition that content is located in par- ticular contexts and that it can have mul- tiple functions or meanings. As argued by Eubanks (2000), “we cannot know what a metaphor means unless we know the circumstances in which the metaphor is uttered – by whom and to whom. . . . Use . . . is precisely what we must con- sider in order to understand any metaphoric expression” (pp. 17–18). Although some of the work of Angus and her colleagues (speciﬁcally, Angus & Rennie, 1988, 1989; Rasmussen, 2000; Rasmussen & Angus, 1996) has focussed attention on how meta- phors could be used in different ways and have different impacts, their line of work has not been pursued, in any signiﬁcant or direct way, by other researchers. As such, their ﬁndings remain limited to the analysis of a small number of metaphor sequences in a small number of psychotherapy sessions. The Promise and Challenges of a Contextual Approach to Metaphor and Psychotherapy Some scholars and researchers in this area have concluded that a contextual approach to understanding the use of metaphor in psychotherapy is needed. For example, in building on a previous call that research into the functions of metaphor take into account the context and goal of discourse (Crider & Cirillo, 1991), Cirillo and Crider (1995) stated that “the more interesting and effective future research will examine metaphors in context, delimiting them care- fully in terms of structure and interpreta- tion, and documenting patterns of relation- ship between speciﬁc contexts, therapeutic goals, and effects of metaphor” (p. 518). Similarly, Rasmussen (2000) concluded that “it is . . . important to emphasize that the use of metaphor is embedded in an ongoing and exceedingly complex clinical process. Con- sequently, the study of metaphor in the clin- ical situation needs to be kept in context to account for this complexity” (p. 372). What would a contextual approach to studying metaphor in psychotherapy entail? This question is, by no means, simple, and my response will inevitably be incomplete. However, my purpose in considering it is to draw attention to the need for a more\n408 LINDA M. MCMULLEN particularized and nuanced conceptualiza- tion of metaphor in psychotherapy and for a more situated empirical approach. To begin with, a different perspective on language needs to be adopted, one in which words are not taken to be a source of power to make things happen (Guerin, 2003) but in which language is understood as “[deriving] its signiﬁcance in human affairs from the way in which it functions within patterns of relationship” (Gergen, 1994, p. 52), includ- ing both microsocial exchanges and broad patterns of cultural life. Viewing language not in terms of its referential, representa- tional, expressive, or communicative func- tions, but rather in terms of its strategic use, requires that we focus on what talk between a speaker and a listener in a par- ticular context is accomplishing [see Gergen (1994) for a fuller account of the correspon- dence versus social constructionist view of language]. One way to begin thinking about what a contextual approach would entail is to start not with a focus on metaphors, per se, but rather on events of clinical interest, for example, on identity talk, on empathic rup- tures, on therapist challenges, on client sad- ness. Given the pervasiveness of metaphors, there is a high likelihood that these events will be constituted, in part, by metaphors; if not, the very absence of metaphors might be informative. Taking the focus off metaphors, per se, could have a dual effect of grounding our analyses in what are considered to be clinically relevant questions and of lessen- ing the practice of analysing decontextual- ized fragments of talk, as is typically the case in empirical research, or of presenting sum- mary descriptions of the use of metaphors as stand-alone interventions, as is often the case in the conceptual, or theory-based, pro- fessional literature. After having deﬁned and identiﬁed events of interest, one way of keeping the study of metaphor situated would be to adopt the practices used by discourse analysts. Although there is a great deal of diver- sity in the theoretical and ideological under- pinnings of different versions of discourse analysis (e.g., conversation analysis, critical discourse analysis, discursive psychology, Foucauldian discourse analysis), what is rel- evant to the present discussion is that dis- course analysis requires a focus on discur- sive practices, that is, on what people are doing with their talk, and/or on discursive resources, that is, what it is that people draw on when they talk (Willig, 2001). Explor- ing what people are doing with their talk and how this work is being done involves an analysis of “how the discourse is structured or organized to perform various functions and achieve various effects or consequences” (Wood & Kroger, 2000, p. 95). Identifying the interpretative repertoires (Potter, 1996, p. 116) or systematically related sets of terms that people draw on when they talk keeps a focus on the wider social and institutional frameworks within which discourse is pro- duced. In such an approach, metaphors are understood as one of many analytical con- cepts that are employed by a speaker to per- form certain actions. As such, any particular metaphor can have multiple meanings, per- form a variety of functions, and be a deﬁn- ing feature of socially and culturally available resources of interpretation. With this approach, metaphors would not be isolated and extracted for analysis. Rather, they would be considered as one of several discursive devices that are variously used and drawn upon to meet certain goals. These goals may or may not be of analytic rele- vance to a researcher interested in a par- ticular set of events in psychotherapy, and any particular instance of a metaphor may or may not further these goals. However, once having determined that an event con- taining a metaphor sequence is of analytic interest, this sequence must be kept in con- text during analysis. Doing so would require that a researcher have knowledge of how the meanings of any particular metaphor have been understood and developed (per- haps over several therapy sessions), and determine through a focus on a sequence of consecutive exchanges between a client and a therapist how the metaphor func- tions with other discursive devices (includ- ing non-metaphoric devices) to achieve certain goals. This kind of analysis would then need to be placed in a broader set of ethnographic\nPUTTING IT IN CONTEXT 409 observations and interpretations. Speciﬁ- cally, as Guerin (2003) argued, we need to document the social, economic, historical, and cultural contexts of events being stud- ied. In this case, we need to be more explicit about the kind of social inﬂuence process that constitutes psychotherapy as practised in a particular time and place, about the cir- cumstances under which any particular per- son seeks psychotherapy, and about the ther- apist’s understanding of his or her role. For example, applying a contextual app- roach to some of my recent work on the talk of depressed women in psychotherapy (McMullen, 1999) would require that I begin not with an analysis of metaphors, per se, but rather with a topic of clinical interest, such as how acts of self-condemnation and self- afﬁrmation are constituted in the conversa- tions between the women and their thera- pists. In selecting instances of such acts for analysis, I might notice that many of these instances include metaphors of “mothering” and of “being child-like.” Although I might choose to limit my analysis to conversational sequences containing these metaphors, I would need to rely on entire transcripts (or audio tapes) of the course of psychotherapy to develop an understanding of what a client means, for example, when she metaphori- cally refers to herself as “Aunt Susan,” as “a three-year-old,” or as “smothering my hus- band with mother love.” Speciﬁcally, I would need to rely on literal language as well as on entailments of these metaphors in develop- ing my understanding. Making an argument that metaphors of “mothering” and of “being child-like” are implicated in acts of self-condemnation and self-afﬁrmation would require, in addition to understanding the meaning of a particular metaphor, evidence of how the metaphor is taken up and jointly developed by the client and the therapist in multiple con- versations in which these acts are accom- plished. Such evidence would include an analysis of how various rhetorical devices (e.g., narratives, non-verbal acknowledge- ments, humour) are used in conversation by the client and the therapist in the service of endorsing the metaphor, rejecting it, or negotiating its interpretation. Understanding psychotherapy as an asymmetrical interpersonal inﬂuence pro- cess in which one person (the client) is expected to disclose personal problems to another person (the therapist) who is expected to provide expert guidance with respect to these problems would be crucial for limiting any claims I might make about how self-condemnation and self-afﬁrmation are performed discursively. In addition, in a contextual approach, the question of what supports the availability of metaphors of “mothering” and of “being child-like” as sites for self-condemnation and self-afﬁrmation by women in some contemporary western societies would be necessary to address. For instance, I might cite evidence of the simultaneous prizing and devaluing of mothers and children (e.g., Caplan, 1989; McMahon, 1995; Zelizer, 1985) in these societies as an interpretative framework for my analysis. Conclusion All metaphors are not equal in their con- tribution to the work of psychotherapy. If we are to add to both our conceptual and empirical understandings of the use of metaphor in psychotherapy, we need to adopt an approach that permits an articu- lation of the range of such contributions. I have argued that the largely decontex- tualized approaches used to date have led to claims that are over-reaching or banal. In particular, claims about the power of metaphor in psychotherapy are possible pre- cisely because metaphors have been isolated and extracted from the talk of which they are a part, and our research ﬁndings are limited because the highly contextualized nature of metaphor in client and therapist talk has not been adequately recognized. These speciﬁc outcomes reﬂect the fact that metaphor the- ory and metaphor research, in general, have largely ignored the conversations that sur- round and subsume metaphors (Eubanks, 2000). The literature on metaphor and psy- chotherapy illustrates the pitfalls of doing decontextualized metaphor analysis.\n410 LINDA M. MCMULLEN However, it also has the potential to draw the metaphor researcher’s attention to the importance of situating one’s analysis. I fully acknowledge the enormous challenge and necessarily partial nature of adopting an approach that takes context seriously for, as Crider and Cirillo (1991) correctly asserted, “any context speciﬁed could itself be embedded in a context” (p. 188). Nevertheless, with a more situated analysis (both in the local and in the broader sense) might come more nuanced and mutually informing theoretical and empirically based developments. Note 1 Given the preponderance of the use of metaphors in psychotherapy (as opposed to other ﬁgures of speech), there is a tendency in the literature to equate metaphor with ﬁgura- tive language in general. In keeping with the dominant trend (and unless otherwise indi- cated), I use “metaphor” in an inclusive way and as interchangeable with “ﬁgurative lan- guage.” References Amira, S. A. (1982).

Borbely Introduction Over the course of three decades of research, various cognitive disciplines have explored the phenomena of metaphor and metonymy, aiming at a deeper understanding of the role they play in human language, thought, and, more recently, artiﬁcial intelligence. This research has led to an increasing con- sensus that the mind inherently functions metaphorically (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and metonymically (Dirven, 1993; Gibbs, 1999). If the claim that the mind func- tions metaphorically turns out to be valid, it will come as no surprise that concepts, theories, and disciplines dealing with men- tal functioning all contain, explicitly or implicitly, a centrally important notion of metaphor. Here we shall focus on psycho- analysis and delineate the very close rela- tionship between its key psychodynamic terms on the one hand and metaphor and metonymy on the other. Despite cognitive scientists’ recent emphasis on embodied experiential cat- egories of thought as unconsciously established and processed (Lakoff, 1987; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999; Rosch, 1978; Varela, Thomson, & Rosch, 1991), they have paid scant attention to psycho- analytic theory. Psychoanalysts, for their part, have generally not helped matters, as their knowledge base gains expression in the idiosyncratic terminologies of rival psychoanalytic schools, making integration with cognitive science claims more difﬁcult still. And yet, the central role of metaphor and metonymy in mental functioning is quite congenial to psychoanalytic thought in all its contemporary guises. In fact, psychoanalysis as both theory and practice exempliﬁes the mind’s most profound metaphor theory – “by another name” – and key psychoanalytic dynamic concepts such as psychological trauma, neurotic defense, normal defense, transference, free associa- tion, and interpretation are directly related to the mind’s metaphoric and metonymic functioning. As a clinical modality, psychoanal- ysis exploits the metaphoric relation- ship between past and present conscious and unconscious mentation, including the use of unconsciously established new 412\nMETAPHOR AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 413 categories (Glucksberg & Keysar, 1993). The analyst tries to understand, and to help the analysand understand, present mentation (as expressed in free associ- ations, dreams, transference experiences, symptoms, defenses, and enactments) as metaphorically informed by relevant past experiences. Conversely, mentation based on present inferences, which relies on the verbal input of free associations and their clinical interpretation, is used to metaphorically update past mentation and to reintegrate sequestered experiences and fantasies into a biographic narrative. Fol- lowing my previous work on this topic (Borbely, 1987), I characterize all infor- mation (conscious or unconscious, healthy or neurotic) originating in the here-and- now that illuminates and reframes the then-and-there as “inferential interpreta- tion,” and all information (conscious or unconscious, healthy or neurotic) from the then-and-there that illuminates and reframes the here-and-now as “transferen- tial interpretation.” It follows that psy- choanalysis by deﬁnition relates past and present metaphorically to one another, irre- spective of whether or not a metaphor is linguistically expressed. For the psycho- analyst, metaphorical comprehension shifts from “seeing something in terms of some- thing else” to “seeing something in terms of another time.” History Despite the relevance of psychoanalysis to a psychodynamic understanding of metonymy and metaphor, psychoanalytic theorists have traditionally restricted their purview to clas- sically conceived notions of linguistic ﬁgures (Arlow, 1979; Freud, 1913; Levin, 1979; Loe- wald, 1960; Makari & Shapiro, 1993; Ogden, 1997; Reider, 1972; Rosen, 1977; Sharpe, 1940; Shengold, 1981; Wurmser, 1977). Only recently have analysts joined the discussion initiated by cognitive scientists about con- ceptual metaphor and metonymy (Borbely, 1995, 1998, 2004; Holland, 1999; Melnick, 1997; Modell, 1997, 2003). Commensurate with recognition of metaphor and metonymy as phenomena of thought rather than merely of language is recognition of the difference between ﬁgurative expression of language and ﬁgura- tive thought using language (Gibbs, 1994a, 1994b, 1999). From this latter distinction, it follows that traditional syntactical criteria for metaphor have ceased to be deﬁnitional at the level of thought and also, as we shall see, at the psychodynamic or mental level. Unconscious categories, embodied in metaphoric experiencing, are now believed to precede, both temporally and epistemically, a purportedly more objective category-based thinking. Thus, an expres- sion such as “UP IS MORE” (Lakoff, 1987) has come to be seen as the result of an uncon- sciously embodied human experience, such as the observation that ﬁlling a container with water raises the water level. And the term embodiment refers not only to behav- iorally grounded internalizations, as in the example just given, but also to internaliza- tions rooted in interpersonal conﬁgurations infused with the passions and conﬂicts denoted by psychoanalytic terms such as “id” (passions, including unacceptable and therefore repressed ideas connected with them); “ego” (reality adaptation; media- tion between id and superego demands); “superego” (conscience-related demands and prohibitions); “Oedipal conﬂict” (trian- gular relationships between child, mother, and father, complicated by sexual and aggressive impulses); and the developmental anxiety series (anxiety of separation; of loss of love; of genital mutilation; guilt; and social disapproval). It is then the psychoanalyst, so famil- iar with irrational aspects of mentation as they enter into psychological understand- ing, who is in a position to connect “UP IS MORE” to ubiquitous fantasy formations, among which may be the perception of the visible male genital, with the rising motion of the erect penis, as “more of or a better gen- ital” than the “castrated” female one. What is at issue is not the correctness of this or any other psychoanalytic explanation in a par- ticular context, but the mere possibility of\n414 ANTAL F. BORBELY integrating irrational fantasies with cognitive science theories. Defense and Figurativity Metaphor as a set of correspondences between two distant conceptual domains (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) is a device for seeing something, or understanding some- thing, “in terms of” something else (Burke, 1945, 503; Ricoeur, 1977, 83). Consider these examples: Freud saw sexuality in terms of personality development and motivation in terms of unconscious processes. The phrase “in terms of” indicates that we are likely deal- ing with a metaphor. In addition to “in terms of,” Ricoeur (1977, 6), following Aristotle (McKeon, 1941, 1459 a 3–8), invokes the notion of “tension between identity and dif- ference” by which he means something “is the same as/is not the same as” something else. I term this latter expression a “hedg- ing equation.” In metonymy, the phrase “stands for” is used in the sense of something being substituted for something else (such as defense for defended against; see below) or belonging to something else (“hands” belongs to “sailor” in “all hands on deck”). Figures are substitutions of literal meanings by hedged meanings of the type “is/is not.” Such hedged meanings are typically associ- ated with sarcasm or irony, so that “John is such a good friend” means “John is not a good friend.” In this example, “is not” has the sense of “is the opposite of the expected.” Among all ﬁgures, only metaphor and metonymy use, in addition to an is/is not hedging, a hedgingly equated meaning of the form “[the target] is the same/is not the same as [the source].” Thus in the metaphor “my job is a jail,” “my job” is the same and is not the same as “a jail,” and in the metonymy “the crown is the king,” “the crown” is the same and is not the same as “the king.” In mentation as biographic narrative, the hedging part of the metaphoric hedg- ing equation can be seen as an expression of temporal and semantic transition (“is/is not anymore”) and the equation itself func- tions as an expression of continuity (“is still the same/is not the same”). Taken together, hedging and equation provide the necessary narrative coherence that mediates between diachronic meaningfulness and synchronic, socially participatory relevance throughout psychological development. As we shall see later, metaphor is in an ongoing way involved in re-conceptualizations, re-categorization of concepts, and re-classiﬁcation of cate- gories and domains. The metonymic hedging equation, while conservative with respect to direct re-categorization, is neverthe- less involved in change. To be speciﬁc, a metonymic extension can be used to empha- size elements of frames, scenes, and scenar- ios for refocusing purposes or open-endedly to allude to, illuminate, activate (K¨ovecses & Radden, 1998, 39), or provide access to mentational entities (Langacker, 1993). Figurative expressions are usually con- scious and directed to others, whereas neurotic defenses are usually unconscious and self-directed. In neurotic defenses, a mentation is employed to ward off some other mentation that would be anxiety provoking if allowed into consciousness. What Anna Freud (1936) termed “defense mechanisms” (repression, reaction forma- tion, idealization, identiﬁcation, projection, and the like) signify neurosis only if they are used for situationally inappropriate purposes and result in symptom forma- tion or pathological character formation. Whether normal or neurotic, defenses are metaphorically or metonymically structured source/target relations between mental enti- ties connected to each other along syn- chronic and diachronic temporal dimensions (see below). At the mental level, normal and neurotic defenses alike correspond to what Johnson (1987, 29) calls “image-schemas” on the cognitive level: “I conceive of them as structures for organizing our experience and comprehension.” Defenses, thus under- stood, comprise in their ensemble not only an individual’s epistemic instrument but an ongoing manner of experiencing life, relat- ing to others, recasting one’s priorities, and designing new enterprises. As such, changes in one’s structure of defenses, occurring typically during a psychoanalysis, lead to a\nMETAPHOR AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 415 different way of experiencing life. In what follows, I focus on the diachronic dimen- sion of defense in relation to metaphor and metonymy. Let us consider the speciﬁcally psycho- analytic meaning of a ﬁgurative utterance consisting of the speaker saying something while meaning something else, for example, “you are a nice friend!” meaning “you are a disappointing friend.” A neurotically defen- sive person who makes such an utterance is saying (or experiencing) something with the unconscious aim of warding off, that is, remaining unaware of, a related aspect of mentation that consciously would be anxi- ety provoking. “I love my brother so much” is emphasized; “I also hate him quite a bit” is warded off. The person in the grip of a neu- rotic defense is inadvertently saying some- thing so as not to own up to something else. If ﬁgures are illocutionary in that they aim at an effect (for the addressee) beyond what is said, defenses are illocutionary in that they aim to prevent an effect (for the speaker and possibly for the addressee) beyond what is said. In this sense, defenses function as “neg- ative” or “denying” ﬁgures, and they may be contrasted with conventionally “positive” or “assertive” ﬁgures (Bloom, 1976, 293f). Metonymy shares with neurotic defense the internal structure of a “stands for” rela- tionship between two parts located within the same domain (crown “stands for” king). But while metonymy allows one mental entity to gain access to, activate, or high- light another conceptual or mental entity (Bartsch, 2002; Langacker, 1993, 30; Radden & K¨ovecses, 1999; Sweetser & Fauconnier, 1996, 13), neurotic defense is a device barring access to a conceptual or mental entity. The neurotic defense stands with its defending mentation for something defended against, but that “something” is as yet undeﬁned and sequestered in an inaccessible mentational system. Thus, neurotic defense, with its two poles, has the structure of a negative, access- barring metonymy, and it may be usefully juxtaposed to positive, access enabling forms of metonymy. Psychodynamically speaking, there is contiguity between a defending part of men- tation, the anxiety mobilized by warded- off fantasies approaching consciousness, and the warded-off fantasies themselves. Gradu- ally, with mounting awareness, the warded- off “something” will be discovered and, once accessible (now in the form of a positive metonymy), it can be more deeply explored in terms of related experiences (metaphor). Let us illustrate this claim with the following: A six-year-old girl, whose infant brother was recently born, shows some of the ambivalent reactions usually seen on such occasions. Instead of talking about her joy and anger, she exclaims: “I love my brother so much!” She defensively uses her positive feeling to cover up (i.e., to defend against) aggressive fantasies. Each time the latter threaten to erupt into conscious- ness, she unconsciously mobilizes opposite feelings to ward them off and to avoid anxiety. Both conceptually and experientially, the little girl’s overcompensatory love and repressed aggression are bound together; like source and target in a metonymy, they are contiguous and therefore part of the same domain. Love comes to stand for hate. The experienced child analyst senses in this child’s productions a compulsive avoidance, a “stands for” or “stands instead” metonymy, and understands that the underlying defen- sive structure may eventually give way to an “in terms of” metaphor. The clinical task consists of helping the unconsciously conﬂicted child transform in as nontrau- matic a manner as possible the negative, access-barring metonymy (i.e., the neurotic defense) into a positive, access-providing form of metonymy (i.e., the defense allows a ﬁrst, acceptable view of the defended against mentation). If the clinical work is successful, the child will eventually under- stand her death wishes toward her brother metaphorically, whether in terms of her reac- tion to feeling displaced by the brother, her fantasy of having been a bad child who was never good enough for her parents, or her immaturity-based, culturally reinforced assumption that a boy is “better” than a girl, speciﬁcally regarding the respective gen- ital (see above). In the process, her feared\n416 ANTAL F. BORBELY aggression will come to lose its compulsive character and be understood as a reaction to trauma-based unconscious fantasies which, previously disguised, are now metaphori- cally understandable and acceptable. As the child becomes aware of her conﬂicting feel- ings, which can be progressively tolerated without undue anxiety, the defense of reac- tion formation becomes less and less neces- sary and may vanish completely. The Linguistic, Conceptual, and Mental Levels of Metaphor and Metonymy Figurativity has been deﬁned in multiple and often confusing ways that correspond to the various disciplinary contexts in which it is invoked (Fahnestock, 1999). Thus, we have ﬁgurativity as ornamentation and per- suasion in discourse (rhetoric); ﬁgurativity as syntactic/semantic relations (linguistics); ﬁgurativity as conceptual/semantic relations of thought (cognitive sciences); and, ﬁnally, and most germanely to my thesis, ﬁgura- tivity as dynamic relations of mentation (psychoanalysis). It is convenient to assign these deﬁnitions to one of three explanatory levels: the linguistic, the cognitive, and the mental. Each level of ﬁgurativity entails a dif- ferent notion of metaphor and metonymy, and each level works with distinct enti- ties as sources and targets: words, con- cepts, and psychodynamics. Thus, each level has a different basis for the metaphoric incongruence criteria: syntax, semantics, and temporality. The basic similarity of these three levels resides in the nature of the source–target relationship. In all three lev- els, that is, “stands for” is emblematic of metonymy with same domain mapping, whereas “in terms of ” is emblematic of metaphor with inter-domain mapping. The mental level includes not merely thoughts but also emotions (Johnson, 1987) and drive-related motivations (Brenner, 1982; Laplanche & Pontalis, 1973; Freud, 1905, 1915a, 1915b, 1933, 1940) along with various amalgams of these three conceptually sep- arate components. If, cognitively speaking, imagination, using metaphor and metonymy as its devices, has the ability to “project concepts onto other concepts” (Barcelona, 2000, 2; Jackendoff, 1992, 198), then, men- tally speaking, it similarly has the abil- ity to project psychodynamics onto other psychodynamics. The term “psychodynamics” is used here in the speciﬁcally psychoanalytic sense of a mental organization that encompasses con- tradictory motivational psychological forces (e.g., thoughts, urges, wishes, impulses, desires, fears, emotions, moods) in dynamic and ﬂuid tension (Moore & Fine, 1990). Such forces encompass the conscious and uncon- scious, symbolic and subsymbolic, and ratio- nal and irrational psychological aspects of all semiotic entities, states, and processes that enter into an individual’s life. This psychody- namic perspective on imagination opposes the common assumption that thoughts are symbolically organized, whereas emotions and desires are organized only subsymbol- ically (Dennett, 1991; Smolensky, 1987). Psychodynamic forces are simultane- ously inﬂuenced by many processes, among them genetic information; neuro-endocrine physiology; and new and previous experi- ences, including traumatic ones. These inﬂu- ences are mentally processed in terms of dispositions, desires, fears, moods, thoughts, and fantasies. Clinical observations and the theoretical inferences to which they give rise sustain the hypothesis that the afore- mentioned components are in constant interaction; that they are not always sharply delineated among themselves; that they change over time; and that they are context and task dependent. In view of this combi- natorial explosion of interactions and trans- formations, our designating entities, states and processes as “thoughts,” “emotions,” and “passions” (desires, aggression) is little more than an attempt to comprehend complexly interwoven processes that are codiﬁed sym- bolically and subsymbolically. Metaphor and metonymy are informational and organiza- tional devices that allow complex menta- tion to “move in realms that lie outside the range of concepts, where thought [better: ‘mentation’] has not hardened into con- cepts” (Bredin, 1984, 56–57, my bracketed\nMETAPHOR AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 417 phrase). Psychoanalytic terms, for example “defense,” “impulse,” “transference,” “uncon- scious conﬂict,” and “anxiety,” aim at captur- ing the grammar underlying the psychody- namic entities of the mind’s language. Metaphor, the Structure of Normal Defense Metaphoricity has been deﬁned by Kit- tay (1987, 69) as a conceptual incongruity. On the linguistic level, such incongruity is expressed as a hedging equation of syntac- tic selection restricted words (in “JULIET IS THE SUN,” a living entity is equated with a lifeless one). On the conceptual level, the incongruity is between differ- ent semantic contents hedgingly equated with each other (“UP IS MORE”). On the mental level, the incongruity is between hedgingly equated psychodynamically rever- berating issues belonging to different devel- opmental stages, different times (“THE SUPERVISOR IS THE FATHER”). In normal defense, what is experi- enced today is metaphorically evaluated in terms of previous experiences without being rigidly determined by the latter. It is this metaphoric tension between the here- and-now and the then-and-there that lends depth and authenticity to our experiencing. This tension arises precisely because source and target in metaphor relate in a manner whereby engendered meaning still has to be speciﬁed without ever achieving ﬁnal state status (Rohrer, 1995). To put the matter prosaically: Experiences change their mean- ing based on other experiences. Let us now turn to psychoanalytic prac- tice, which makes full use, albeit implicitly, of the metaphoric dialectic between past and present. Trauma as Loss of Metaphoricity Under nontraumatic conditions, experiences are mentally registered with an optimal vagueness as to their present, past, and future meaning. Such vagueness (Tuggy, 1993) is a manifestation of the metaphoric hedging equation on the mental level. This necessary vagueness or openness, this nonﬁnite state status of an experience in being registered, will be referred to as an experience’s “metaphoric potential,” or its “metaphoricity.” Such metaphoricity, in its clinically relevant sense, allows future and past chains of experiences to be meaning- fully conveyed to each other (Katz, 1998, 22), accommodating ever-changing perspec- tives, contexts, and points of view. With- out metaphoricity’s hypothetical and pro- visional vagueness, expressed in a hedging equation, experiences are not assimilable, that is, their meaning cannot be shaped from the vantage point of other experiences. Psy- chological trauma, which leads to severe anxiety, impairs or destroys the possibility of registering an experience with appropri- ate ambiguity. It thus diminishes an expe- rience’s metaphoric potential regarding the formation of, and inclusion by, new perspec- tives (Bartsch, 2002, 49). Trauma leads to rigidly accepting the meaning of an experience as frozen and therefore as conclusively valid in all contexts and for all times. This reliance on a ﬁxed meaning contrasts with the ability to com- prehend an experience more ﬂexibly, with any single meaning understood as hypothet- ical as to content and context, provisional as to time, and so existing outside ﬁnite state phenomena. That is, trauma tends to a “lit- erality” divorced from metaphoric process, a literality in which the overly speciﬁc mean- ing of an experience is unambiguous, inﬂex- ible, and even axiomatic. Thus sequestered from modifying outside experience, trauma must be defended against to avoid anxiety and the subjective feeling of meaninglessness threatened by its eruption into conscious- ness. On this account, a traumatic experi- ence collapses the present domain and the past domain into a single, namely, a pseudo- present, one. This temporal domain coa- lescence leads the individual to experience what belongs to the past falsely as of present origin. Past and present domains are now prevented to metaphorically communicate with each other. The pseudo-present stands for the past rather than being informed in terms of the past. Neurosis can be seen as a\n418 ANTAL F. BORBELY confusion of times. To the extent of our neu- rotic impairments we live in the past (or in the future) rather than in the present. Consider this clinically salient fact: A father beats his son. For the son, the domains “father” and “painful, anxiety- provoking mistreatment causing intolerable fantasies,” are experientially fused together as metonymic source and target of one domain. The sequestrations are kept from consciousness by an access-barring struc- ture, that is, by a neurotic defense. The defense consigns the sequestrations to an unconscious status in order to protect the son from re-experiencing massive anxiety. The neurotic defense wards off the anxiety- provoking meaning of the beating experi- ence, as exempliﬁed in fantasies of homicide, castration, or homosexual seduction involv- ing the father as perpetrator or victim, which in their ensemble we characterize as “the defended against.” What does this neurotic defense look like clinically? It may take a variety of forms. For example, the son may succeed in keeping these anxiety-provoking fantasies unconscious by erecting the defenses of repression and idealization. The father’s positive attributes will then be exaggerated, whereas his shortcomings, together with the painful and dangerous fantasies con- nected to them, will be scotomized, that is, barred from consciousness. Metaphoricity is thereby replaced by a compulsively functioning, access-barring, metonymic defense. Such defensiveness is itself typ- ically hidden from awareness by another metonymically functioning defense termed “rationalization.” Taken together, the neu- rotic defenses of repression, idealization, and rationalization drain the father-beating- his-son experience of the optimal vagueness associated with metaphoricity. The mean- ing of the experience is not subject to interpretation by other “non-beating” expe- riences that may be adaptively useful in various contexts. The experience of a father beating his son is not provisional as to its openly evolving “ultimate” meaning; it is not context-dependent. Trauma, by short- circuiting the metaphoricity that allows, as mentioned previously, future and past chains of experiences to be meaningfully conveyed to each other, precludes an opti- mally resilient, autopoetic self-organization. Absent such resilience, the individual’s responsiveness to the present and openness to the future are severely restricted. Psy- choanalysis, when it is successful, restores this resilience through metaphorizing interpretation that leads to a recon- ceptualization of previously established concepts and their recategorization (Glucks- berg & Keysar, 1993) along new dimensions of relevance and meaningfulness (Borbely, 1998). To summarize, the defense against a sequestered part of mentation, which is acti- vated each time a warded-off impulse threat- ens to become conscious, metonymically stands for the defended against. Trauma, as we have seen, transforms a two-domain metaphoric experience into a one-domain metonymic one. What are the special attributes of this kind of metonymy? As mentioned above, while metonymy is usu- ally deﬁned as a mental access provid- ing device, in neurotic defense it is access barring: Since the defense bars access to the defended against, we use the term “negative metonymy.” We may deﬁne normal defense as having a metaphoric structure and neu- rotic defense as having a negative metonymic one. The Negative Metonymic Structure of Neurotic Defense and Its Interpretation According to Taylor (1995, 83ff, see also Croft, 1993), the essence of metonymy “resides in the possibility of establishing con- nections between entities which co-occur within a given conceptual structure.” One of these co-occurring mental entities, the source, can provide access to another men- tal entity, the target. In the psychoanalytic resolution of neurotic defense, a negative metonymic, access baring, mental constella- tion is gradually transformed via a positive metonymic into a metaphoric one, where access is provided and awareness can be increased.\nMETAPHOR AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 419 As an example of clinically impaired metaphoricity and its therapeutic transfor- mation, consider the following: An ana- lyst tells the analysand, who is inappro- priately fearful of his superior in the workplace, “You treat your supervisor as if he were your father.” He points out that the analysand symptomatically experiences the relationship to the supervisor as “stand- ing for” the relationship to his father. It is as if the domain pertaining to “supervi- sor” were the same as the domain origi- nally pertaining to “father.” (It is assumed, of course, that the father was feared.) The original experience with father, an author- ity, has been unconsciously displaced onto the supervisor, another authority, since the original constellation has been registered axiomatically rather than with provisional vagueness. “Supervisor” now metonymically stands for “father.” Conceptually, an obso- lete “father constellation” has been extended through time to the present situation and is falsely experienced as pertaining to the “here and now” rather than only to the “then and there.” With successful analytic work, the super- visor’s and father’s roles as authority ﬁgures will come to be metaphorically equated. “Stands for” will yield to “iden- tity in difference” or “in terms of,” a precondition of the ability to differenti- ate between past and present. Sameness will be understood as metaphoric simi- larity rather than as metonymic contigu- ity. The social constellations pertaining to “supervisor” and “father” will simultane- ously be appreciated as identical and yet as vastly different, that is, as belonging to the separate domains of work and fam- ily. With the restoration of metaphoric- ity, the previous temporal/semantic conﬂa- tion, which yielded a symptomatic conﬂa- tion of “supervisor” and “father,” gives way to temporal bi-directionality (from past to present and from present to past) with a domain tension appropriate to different events from different times, biographically understood. Negative metonymy, then, is tantamount to a faulty time tagging that derives from the sequestration of past experiences. This temporal conﬂation is closely connected with the following: the axiomatization of past experiences (with its pseudo-relevance for the present), the isolation of such expe- riences from an updating process by subse- quent experiences, and the loss of context sensitivity. The negative metonymic struc- ture of neurosis thereby becomes a confu- sion of times. The past, rather than being held in abeyance to inform the present (nor- mal defense), collapses with the present to (partly or entirely) determine it as a mere extension of the past. The resulting psychopathological formation collapses two domains into a single functional domain. Within this domain, defense and defended against relate metonymically to each other, which is to say they rigidly belong to each other. Metaphoric transparency has given way to metonymic opaqueness. Transference, Metonymically and Metaphorically Conceived Figurativity, which provides a conceptual handle for comprehending the nature and treatment of neurotic defenses, is no less essential for understanding the clinical trans- ference. Through his invention of the psy- choanalytic method, the application of which required a special psychoanalytic set- ting, Freud created an intimate environ- ment that elicited unconscious and con- scious experiences from the analysand’s past. Transference, in its speciﬁcally psychoana- lytic sense, refers to the displacement onto the analyst of attitudes, feelings, and expec- tations originally experienced in relation to the analysand’s signiﬁcant childhood ﬁgures, as these attitudes, feelings, and expectations have been mobilized by the psychoanalytic treatment setting (see Moore & Fine, 1990). The analysand, it should be stressed, trans- fers these childhood feeling states onto the analyst even though they have no substan- tive connection to his or her here-and-now relationship to the analyst. The transference, thus understood, has a simultaneously metonymic and meta- phoric structure: The analyst, as presently experienced, “stands for” real or imagined\n420 ANTAL F. BORBELY ﬁgures and experiences of the past. In neurotic transference as in neurotic defense, a time confusion takes place. What is expe- rienced in the here-and-now really belongs to the then-and-there. The analyst is expe- rienced as if he or she metonymically stands for a (usually parental) childhood ﬁgure. With repeated interpretation of neurotic transference, the analyst will come to be experienced metaphorically “in terms of” a childhood ﬁgure. Metonymic certainty will give way to optimal metaphoric vague- ness as the transference experience is inte- grated into the mainstream of biographic narrativity. This resolution of metonymic into metaphoric transference will be accom- panied by increased awareness as metonymic perplexity yields to metaphoric insight. On this view, Freud’s emblematic statement regarding the goals of psychoanalytic treat- ment, “Where Id was Ego shall be,” is transformed into, “Where metonymy was, metaphor shall be.” The transformation of metonymic into metaphoric transference has several aspects, all of which aid in reversing traumatic expe- rience. Traumatically sequestered experi- ences may be re-experienced in the transfer- ence simultaneously in four different ways: as current, because it is presently occurring; as of experiential relevance and poignancy, because it is occurring in a relationship with the analyst; as confusing, because the analyst is experienced as a childhood ﬁgure; and as obsolete in the present, because successful interpretations have restored metaphoricity and ended (or at least signiﬁcantly attenu- ated) the initial temporal conﬂation. The therapeutic action of analytic treat- ment resides in the fact that the current reliving of the sequelae of earlier trauma occurs with a different protagonist who seeks to metaphorize through interpreta- tion what was originally and traumatically metonymized. As in neurotic defense, the set of issues implicated in the transference may at ﬁrst be experienced with metonymic unease. This time, however, unease is experienced within a benign therapeutic relationship and optimally gives way to the relief of restored relevance, poignancy, and ambigu- ity afforded by this relationship. Interpreta- tions unavailable in the past provide new – and newly assimilable – insights. The latter serve to forestall “mindless” repetition of the traumatic insults of the past. The awareness of the obsoleteness of relational dynamics that had for many years appeared to be of great, even overwhelming, relevance to the present is a surprising and liberating experi- ence for the analysand. Psychoanalytic inter- pretation is a (re)-metaphorization of dam- aged or lost metaphoricity. On this view, interpretation is not only an integral part of the psychoanalytic enterprise, but is an intrinsic part of the mind’s metaphoric func- tioning. Normal defense can now be under- stood as a successful self-interpretation, neu- rotic defense as an unsuccessful one. By interpreting, the analyst metaphorizes the analysand’s metonymic stagnations. The Primary, Secondary, and Metaphoric Processes Having conceptualized the metaphoric pro- cess as constitutive of normal mental func- tioning, its relationship to what psychoan- alytic theory designates “primary process” and “secondary process” remains to be dis- cussed. The primary process is unconscious, follows the pleasure principle, and uses dis- placement and condensation to allow ideas to attach themselves to unconscious wishes. The secondary process is used when explicit explanatory demands impinge on the indi- vidual. A property of consciousness, it adheres to the reality principle and is associ- ated with propositional and logical thought, reasoning, and judgment (Laplanche & Pontalis, 1973). Most psychological change occurs uncon- sciously, via the primary process, involving the secondary process only peripherally. It is here proposed that the processes involved in psychological growth be assigned to the metaphoric process, as this process operates at the mental level set forth above. Intu- itively, the metaphoric process occupies an intermediate position between the primary\nMETAPHOR AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 421 process and secondary process. It shares with the primary process the following con- necting devices for associations: Displace- ment (positive metonymy; a constituent of metaphor) and condensation (a constituent of metaphor). Conversely, it shares with the secondary process the governance of the reality principle and the advanced cogni- tive and judgmental capabilities associated with the reality-governed maturational pro- cess. To summarize, primary process cap- tures irrational mentation, secondary pro- cess rational mentation, and the metaphoric process imaginative rationality. Since the latter is closely associated with psycholog- ical growth, a disturbance in the capacity to metaphorize typically leads to neurotic con- ﬂict and impaired creativity. Alternatively, the metaphoric process may be integrating most features of both the primary and secondary process. Only the chaos associated with the primary pro- cess and the rigidities of thought and behav- ior associated with the secondary process stand outside the integration. That is, the metaphoric process represents an integra- tion of primary process and secondary process as they coalesce in the optimal functioning of the mind. The unintegrated aspects of primary process and secondary process are manifestations of the mind’s sub- optimal, negative metonymic functioning. The metaphoric process is nonlinear, vaguely determined by temporal informed- ness, and yet unpredictable; its suspended pertinence never reaches ﬁnal state sta- tus. Borrowing from the terminology of complexity theory, we may associate pri- mary process with chaos or turbulence; sec- ondary process with order or quiescence; and metaphoric process with an intermedi- ate position at the ‘edge of chaos’ (Kauff- man, 2000). The process of free association, the linchpin of the psychoanalytic method, brings the metaphoric process closer still to the edge of chaos – for the purpose of opti- mizing creative risk taking. With its intermediate position between primary and secondary process, the meta- phoric process is linked to the realm of connotations as opposed to the realm of denotations (secondary process) or chaotic associations (primary process). In the realm of connotations, old meanings are preserved in metaphoric tension with new mean- ings (Radman, 1997, 83). The imaginative rationality operative within the metaphoric process has a heuristic function: It antic- ipates and searches by guessing, by play- ful trial actions, and by developing new insights and meanings that are appropri- ately agnostic or open ended in terms of their value. In the process old rules are dis- carded and new ones created as the indi- vidual embraces changing notions of rele- vance and meaningfulness, an integral aspect of creatively recasting the world and the self (Ricoeur, 1977). The Metaphor Languages of Different Psychoanalytic Schools Neurosis has been conceptualized as the individual’s damaged ability to metaphorize owing especially to psychological trauma usually occurring in childhood. The ther- apeutic action of psychoanalytic treat- ment, on the other hand, has been equated with the analyst’s interpretative (re)-metaphorizations of neurotic defenses and symptoms. The additive effect of such interpretations over the course of a treat- ment is to help the analysand to recover his or her instances of lost metaphoric- ity. As an aspect of this interpretive task, the analyst must relate clinical experiences occurring in the here-and-now of the trans- ference to childhood occurrences that are either released from childhood amnesia or reconstructed through the joint efforts of analysand and analyst. The analyst brings the transference and the childhood events into metaphoric alignment. All psychoanalytic schools that analyze transferences are necessarily concerned with connecting transference experiences with developmental childhood constellations. To this end, different types of analysts employ their own metaphor languages. Thus, analysts identiﬁed with psychoanalytic self psychology will connect lapses in empathy\n422 ANTAL F. BORBELY occurring in the transference/counter-trans- ference with lapses among the caregivers of early childhood; Kleinian psychoanalysts will observe elements of the paranoid and depressive positions in the transference and trace them back to corresponding child- hood events; and classical Freudian ana- lysts will discern incestuous and aggressive fantasies in the transference and attempt to link them, whether explicitly or implic- itly, to childhood events. It may be hoped that the metaphor theory of psychoanaly- sis, which provides a conceptual umbrella that subsumes these and other interpre- tive emphases, will promote more fruitful collaboration among analysts of different theoretical persuasions. Summary and Outlook The key terms of psychoanalysis may be taken to designate aspects of the mind’s metaphoric functioning, including its neg- ative metonymic impairment when func- tioning suboptimally. This understanding is premised on the elaboration of a tempo- ral metaphor concept, which is located at the very center of psychoanalytic theory. A temporal metaphor is conceived as con- necting temporal domains rather than syn- tactically or semantically deﬁned domains. As such, a temporal metaphor does not take words, sentences, or texts as the units to be connected but rather psychody- namic constellations occurring at different points in a person’s narrative life history. Within the temporal domain, psychody- namics manifest themselves as structures (defense, defended against), forces (repres- sion, impulse), or nonspeciﬁed inﬂuences (inference, transference). Such varied psy- chodynamic entities may denote, variously, different states of aggregation and mobility, different rates of change over time, and dif- ferent functional aspects of mentation. What unites these psychodynamic conﬁgurations is their temporal bi-directionality (from past to present and from present to past) and the domain tension maintained between dif- fering times (metaphoric relationship) or, suboptimally, the collapse of these times into a single domain (negative metonymic relationship). This approach encourages the development of a psychodynamic metaphor theory applicable to the traditional setting of clinical psychoanalysis. Equally important, it permits a deeper understanding of normal personality development, especially in its psychodynamic aspects, beyond the clini- cal setting. By showing how psychodynamic terms like trauma, defense, transference, and interpretation denote different aspects of the mind’s metaphoric and metonymic func- tioning a common language between psy- choanalysis and other cognitive sciences can be envisaged, facilitating an interdisciplinary dialogue.

Although we rarely, as experimental psychologists, take advan- tage of literary sources, undeniably novel- ists and poets had provided us with wonder- ful examples of linguistic metaphors based on sensory experiences.2 Not only Proust, Poe, Baudelaire, to cite some, but also con- temporary novelists help us in reﬂecting on the language with which we name percep- tual experiences. This happens to be the case in Smell, a novel by the Indian writer Radhika Jha, that offers an extremely rich repertoire of perceptual metaphors. Smell describes the young protagonist Leela Patel’s efforts to ﬁnd her way in Paris after escap- ing from the anti-Indian riots in Nairobi. Leela Patel has an instinctive knowing of how to blend spices with food for maximiz- ing their ﬂavors, a natural sense for cooking driven by an implicit dialogue with the ﬂa- vors and scents of Indian spices. The clash between the French and the Indian cultures is translated into a sense-based conﬂict, as shown by the opening of the novel that describes a metaphorical battle among cul- turally bound smells and aromas: the scent of freshly baked baguettes, driven by the spring Parisian breezes, does battle with the smells emanating from cardamom, masala, turmeric, cinnamon, and coriander stored in the Epicerie Madras of Leela’s uncle. Like an unwelcome army, the aroma of French bread captures Leela’s nostrils reminding her of being parted from home, in a foreign distant culture that even perceptually invades her life. In Jha’s novel, smell and taste metaphor- ically and perceptually go hand in hand, just as in La physiologie du goˆut. Or m´editations de gastronomie trascendente3 written almost two centuries ago (1825) by the gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. As we will see in this chapter, the metaphorical use of sensory language is rather unbalanced across modalities. This in part reﬂects the fact that the informa- tional richness of perceptual experiences is hardly rendered by linguistic expressions. As an example, consider the case of chromatic experience and color names: in Italian, we 425\n426 CRISTINA CACCIARI often describe both the sky and the sea with the same adjective “azzurro” (“blue”): we use this “stereotype” of color,4 even though we are well aware that it does not cap- ture at all the chromatic characteristics of the two percepts. Another example comes from the descriptions of smells, perfumes, and aromas: we often name them borrow- ing words from other sensory experiences (e.g., taste: sweet, bitter) or using the source name (as in the smell of jasmin):5 “the words we apply to smells represent either the objects that produce them metonymically, as in rose, or their qualities through analogues derived from other modalities, as in bitter” (Marks, 1996, 40). Unsurprisingly, smell is deﬁned as a speechless sense (Ackerman, 1990). More generally, what constitutes a “veridical label” for a smell or for other per- ceptual experience? In many cases, there is no one-to-one correspondence between a smell and its name, and participants asked to name a smell end up naming it with labels that do not match either the odor- ant’s chemical name nor that of the source (e.g., the smell of my grandmother’s kitchen; Boisson, 1997; David et al., 1997; Schab, 1990).6 A question addressed further on in this chapter is whether this language imbalance is culturally bound, or it also reﬂects adaptive aspects and neuro-cognitive underpinnings: as noted by Williams in his work on synaesthetic adjectives, “connec- tions might exist among ontogeny, phy- logeny, the neurophysiology of sensation, cognition, and naming” (1976, 473) that sug- gest a point of interaction between mind and brain. The Aim of the Chapter Years ago the anthropologist Brenda Beck (1978, 1987) deﬁned metaphors as “bridges.” She argued, “If forced to delimit the concept of metaphor I would insist on the experien- tial, body-linked, physical core of metaphor- ical reasoning abilities” (Beck, 1987, 11). The aim of this chapter is to dig into the “physi- cal” core of the metaphorical language used to name sensory experiences. The work- ing hypothesis that drives this chapter is that most perceptually based metaphori- cal expressions (e.g., a cold silence, a stony ﬂavor)7 are motivated and rooted in the structure of perceptual experiences and sensory systems. Metaphors do not reﬂect an abstract–amodal combination of word senses, but rather constitute the linguistic expression of the neural endowment neces- sary for treating sensory information. This hypothesis is not entirely new, in a sense. Marks (1982, 1996) partly anticipated it with his work on perceptual metaphors. He argued, “Even if some perceptual metaphors end up being mediated linguistically, their origins appear to be wholly in perception itself, starting within perceptual processes before being overlaid and dominated by lin- guistic ones” (1996, 59). Consistently, recent work in the neurosciences (e.g., Arbib & Rizzolatti, 1996; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001a, 2001b; Rizzolatti & Arbib, 1998) sug- gests that the semantic motivation for many metaphors is rooted in, and reﬂects, the structure of the neural architecture that subserves sensory and motor experiences. Perceptually based theories of knowledge also propose that conceptual and perceptual knowledge share a common neural substrate and a format. For instance, according to the Perceptual Symbol System model (Barsalou, 1999), conceptual knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor systems, a viewpoint shared by Embodied Cognition theories (e.g., Gibbs, 2003) as well. Whereas amodal theories of knowledge do not assume activation of per- ceptual information whenever a linguistic label of a percept is encountered, percep- tual theories claim that people represent and process concepts activating and using perceptual simulations or re-enactments (Barsalou et al., 2003). A brief outline of the chapter: ﬁrst, I consider synaesthetic metaphors, the most investigated case of linguistic bridge across the senses. Then I examine the psychophys- ical properties underling cross-sensory sim- ilarities in ﬁgurative language. This intro- duces the third part of the chapter centered on the neuro-cognitive basis of synaesthesia\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 427 Figure 24.1. The direction of metaphorical transfer across sensory modalities (Williams, 1976). where it is not a linguistic statement but a perceptual experience to cross sensory boundaries (e.g., between number and col- ors, or vision and touch). Then other cases of multimodality are discussed before driving some tentative conclusions about the rela- tionships between metaphorical language and sensory experience. Linguistic Synaesthesia: Crossing the Senses Metaphorically In synaesthetic metaphors, words that per- tain to one sensory modality (e.g., vision) are extended to express another sensory modality (e.g., audition), as exempliﬁed by Kandinskij who named one of his drawings as follows: “Double sound, cold tension of the straight lines, warm tension of the curved lines, the rigid to the inﬁnity, the ﬂexible to the compact.” Two main approaches inves- tigated the psychological dimensions under- lying sensory metaphors: 1. A taxonomic approach that identiﬁed the directions of the metaphorical bor- rowings trying to establish a hierarchy among the sensory modalities acting as “donors” and “recipients,” respectively. 2. A psychophysical approach that ana- lyzed the physical characteristics of the signals and events that enter into lin- guistic synaesthetic metaphors (e.g., the pitch of a sound, the brightness of a light). We start by examining the ﬁrst approach that identiﬁed the senses act- ing as metaphorizers (the donors) and metaphorized (the recipients). Directions of Metaphorical Mapping across the Senses Williams (1976) proposed a model of metaphorical transfer across modalities (the ﬁve senses, plus color and dimension) based on the analysis of the semantic change over time of more than 100 English synaes- thetic adjectives (see also Classen, 1993; Day, 1996; Derrig, 1978; Howes, 2002; Pelamatti & Savardi, 2003; Ullman, 1945, 1962). To Williams, a systematic sequence exists in the application of sensory terms from a modality to another based on a hierarchy among the senses relative to the order in which they give or receive a semantic sense from other modalities (see Figure 24.1). Touch is at one extreme as the more common donor, and color and sound at the opposite extreme, as the most com- mon recipients. In Williams’s corpus, refer- ences to smell do not contribute to denote other modalities (but see Callejas, 2001, for counterexamples extracted from Hearney’s poetry), taste is only used to refer to smell and sound, and dimension only to color and sound. Williams exempliﬁes the main “ﬁrst-order” types of metaphorical transfer as follows: 1. Touch words: they are generally trans- ferred to taste (e.g., “sharp taste”), color (e.g., “dull color”), and sound (e.g., “soft sounds”). Touch words are rarely shifted to denote vision or smell. 2. Taste words: they are transferred to smell (e.g., “sour smell”) and sound (e.g., “sweet music”) but not back to tactile experience or forward to dimension or color.\n428 CRISTINA CACCIARI 3. Olfactory words: they are not trans- ferred to other senses. 4. Dimension words: they are transferred to color (e.g., “ﬂat gray”) or sound (e.g., “deep sound”). 5. Color words: they are shifted only to sounds (e.g., “bright sound”). 6. Sound words: they are transferred only to color (e.g., “quiet green”). Sensory words in English transferred “from the physiologically least differenti- ating, most evolutionary primitive sensory modalities to the most differentiating, most advanced, but not vice versa” (Williams, 1976, 464–465). Although one can imagine possible counterexamples (Callejas, 2001), or look into natural corpora for ﬁnding some, other evidence suggests that the senses and features considered by Williams are not equally distributed in the donor or recipient positions (see below). The problem of directionality in synaes- thetic language had been previously raised by Ullmann (1945) who examined 2000 synaesthetic metaphors extracted from English, French, and Hungarian poetry. His directionality scale went from the “highest” modality (sight) to the “lowest” one (touch): the metaphor’s topic usually represented a term belonging to the highest point in the scale and the metaphor’s modiﬁer (or vehi- cle) to the lowest point (e.g., “a cold light” is much more frequent than “a lighted cold- ness”). Recently, Shen (1997, 1998) inves- tigated a contemporary corpus of Hebrew poetry ﬁnding analogous mappings from low values onto high ones that would reﬂect a mapping “from more accessible or basic con- cepts onto less accessible or less basic ones /that/ seems more natural and is preferred over the opposite mapping” (Shen, 1997, 51). Hence, “a sweet silence,” where the map- ping proceeds from taste (a highest point) to sounds (a lower point), would be pre- ferred and more frequent in poetry than the reverse, “a silent sweetness” (Shen, 1998). Interestingly, some authors recently claimed that the directionality of synaes- thetic metaphors mirrors that observed in real synaesthesia, as exempliﬁed by the higher frequency of induction from hearing to vision than of the reverse (e.g., Cytowic, 1989; Day, 1996; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001b). The directionality would reﬂect some neuroanatomical constraints that allow certain types of cross-activations, and not others (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001b; see below). The sense directionality proposed by the taxonomic approach basically reﬂects the differential relevance and reliability that most of the western culture has attributed to the knowledge obtained from the sense organs. Unsurprisingly, it almost perfectly mirrors the senses hierarchy of Aristotle that ordered the intellectual relevance of the senses starting from sight, followed by hear- ing, olfaction, taste, and touch. He regarded touch as the primary sense and sight as the most advanced, with taste as a special type of touch and smell intertwined with taste. The ancient Greek philosophical lan- guage “borrowed terms and expressions con- nected with the act of vision from ordi- nary language and adapted them to describe acts of knowledge and the original perme- ation between seeing and knowing” (Napoli- tano Valditara, 1994, 8). Aristotle put sight among “perfect actions” establishing at the same time a bridge between sight and knowl- edge and the excellence of vision over the other sensory activities. Also audition and taste, or olfaction and touch, could be used for knowing providing a variety of percep- tual information, but the knowledge capac- ity of sight was by no means reached having a deep and structured similarity with intel- lectual knowledge (Napolitano Valditara, 1994). Differently, in the Hebraic tradition knowledge has an auditory root, and “Reve- lation” takes place in a sphere metaphysically related to the auditory dimension (Scholem, 1970).8 Functional neuro-cognitive reasons make vision the most typical medium for knowl- edge, even though one can ignore that Plato, Aristotle, Parmenide, or Senofonte already stated it. The information we derive from the visual system, and from language, in fact sustain the apprehension and archi- tecture of our external and internal world\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 429 (Jackendoff, 1987, 1992). As pointed out by Miller and Johnson-Laird in their seminal book on language and perception, our model of “the external world, insofar as we consider it perceptually based, derives primarily from what you see, what you hear, feel, and smell is compatible with such a world” (1976, 618). Cross-Sensory Similarities in Metaphorical Language The aim of the psychophysical approach is to investigate the perceptual correspon- dences between sensory experiences and linguistic metaphors. A consistent body of evidence exists showing that sensory metaphorical transfers are not at random but are motivated by the perceptual char- acteristics of the event metaphorically matched with another perceptual event (i.e., the brightness of a light with the pitch or loudness of a sound, and so forth; e.g., Marks, 1982, 1996; Marks & Bornstein, 1987). According to Marks (1982), if you ask sev- eral people “which is brighter, a cough or a sneeze?” (p. 177), the vast majority responds that a sneeze is brighter, higher in pitch than coughs, and that high-pitched sounds are like bright lights. Sneezes and coughs are examples of acoustic events that can be eas- ily described in visual terms. What Marks elegantly demonstrated is that such descrip- tions are systematic and based on the psy- chophysical characteristics of the mapped perceptual events due to a “metaphori- cal consanguinity” (1982, p. 192) between pitch and brightness and between loudness and brightness. This produced a “suprasen- sory attribute – brightness – that is com- mon to the auditory and visual domains” rooted in “some fundamental phenomeno- logical property of the makeup of sensory experience” (1982, p. 192). Marks (1978) and Marks and Born- stein (1987) showed that many French and English synaesthetic metaphors rest on just a few cross-modal resemblances anchored to the general properties of perceptual responses. Sensory metaphors such as “the murmur of the gray twilight” of Poe or the “bright sound of battle, loud light of thun- der” of Swinburne are based on the sensory equivalence of the softness of a sound and the dimness of a light, that is of loudness and brightness. The ease of comprehension of these lines of poetry reﬂects the structure of semantic memory where “a ‘murmur’ is coded as prototypically soft, and ‘twilight’ is coded as prototypically dim” (Marks & Bornstein, 1987, 54), a viewpoint consistent with a recent perceptually based model of knowledge (Barsalou, 1999) and with cogni- tive neuroscience ﬁndings. Comprehension is not so effortless in metaphors such as “the sound of coming darkness” or “dawn comes up like thunder” (Marks & Bornstein, 1987) since there fairly different and unaligned values of auditory and visual intensity are matched. The softness of the sound has to be computed via its metaphorical equiva- lence with the dim light of the coming dark- ness, and the decrease in light brightness with an abrupt burst of sounds. Both cases go beyond, and must be independently com- puted from, the psychophysical characteris- tics of the events. Speciﬁcally, in Kipling’s metaphor dawn “does not reach especially high on the scale of brightness. Thunder, on the other hand, is loud” (Mark & Bornstein, 1987, p. 60). Many other types of cross-sensory corre- spondences were investigated in the litera- ture. Zellner and Kautz (1990) observed that odor perception is inﬂuenced by the color of the to-be-perceived substance for both tradi- tional odor–color associations (e.g., orange- ﬂavored drinks with an intense orange color) and for newly created ones (Rouby et al., 2002). Usually, if a substance has no spe- ciﬁc color, it is also expected to be odor- less, while colored substances are sup- posed to be odorous. Another interesting case is the color–temperature correspon- dence (e.g., yellow/orange to warmness, and blue/green to coldness) whose metonymic structure, according to Marks and Born- stein (1987), reﬂects a range of universal experiences “with ﬁre and ﬂames, with the warmth of the sun, with the cool lakes and rivers and so forth. Throughout the world, the sun appears yellow, whereas large\n430 CRISTINA CACCIARI bodies of water appear blue and green, and these associations transcend speciﬁc cultures” (p. 57). Five Separate Senses? Generally, we speak of the ﬁve senses as if they were distinct specialized entities, although we are ordinarily exposed to an array of stimuli that reaches and simulta- neously activates more than one sensory modality at a time. Human perceptual expe- rience involves in fact simultaneous stim- ulation through multiple sensory channels whose information is integrated by the brain in multisensory integration sites (Callan et al., 2004). Experientially, the boundary between sensory modalities can easily be broken when we infer, for instance, the hap- tic quality of a surface (e.g., its roughness) from seeing it, or in the case of the taste of a food that is inﬂuenced by its texture, smell, visual properties, and temperature (a m´elange perfectly known by chefs and sommeliers). Can we have any experience of taste without being able to perceive the corresponding smell?9 Hardly not, as sug- gested by the neural structures subserving taste and smell (see below), and even by the experience of having a cold, or closing our nose. Therefore, it is not surprising that the criteria mainly proposed by philosophers for separating each sense from the other are far from being clear-cut and independent (cf. Cacciari & Levorato, 2003; Leon, 1988; Nelkin, 1990; Stoffregen & Bardy, 2001). We might summarize them as follows: 1. The experiential criterion: the senses can be differentiated using the experi- ences associated with their operations (Leon, 1988; Nelkin, 1990). For instance, there is a qualitative difference between seeing an object as square and feeling an object as square. This would lead to distinguish between a visual shape and a tactile shape which is hardly convincing. 2. The property criterion: the senses can be distinguished based on the proper- ties detected by means of them. For instance, sight would be specialized for perceiving shape and color. But many properties exist that can be detected by more than one sense (for instance, shape, extension, and position by both vision and touch). We also develop sen- sory expectations so that if we see a rose bush we also expect it to have a rose perfume. Furthermore, the operation of one sense can even interfere with that of another one as demonstrated by the McGurk effect (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976) where the perception of an audi- torily presented phoneme was affected by an incongruent co-occurrent visual cue (i.e., lip movements). 3. The activating mechanism criterion: The senses can be differentiated based on the mechanisms that activate them, those on which they depend for their operations (e.g., light in the case of sight). But we can infer, for instance, tac- tile information from seeing a surface. 4. The sense-organ criterion: the senses would differ according to the differ- ent parts of the body involved, namely, according to the sense organs involved (e.g., the eyes for visual perception, the ears for hearing). But the eyes are both visually and tactually sensitive, and the neural basis of the sensory system is much more cross-modal than posited by this criterion; 5. The belief criterion: since certain kinds of sensations are perceived as correlat- ing with what we take to be stimulation of a particular part of the body, we con- struct belief systems concerning the cor- relations between sensation and sense- organ. But, as Nelkin put it, do we have ﬁve senses because “there is a systematic correlation between our sorts of sensa- tions and our beliefs about their organic origin or because of a systematic corre- lation between our sorts of beliefs and our beliefs about their organic origin, or a combination of the two?” (1990, 164). It is hard to tell. None of these criteria sufﬁces for divid- ing perception into the visual, auditory,\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 431 gustatory, olfactory, and tactile senses. As Stoffregen and Bardy (2001) put it, the assumption of separate senses may seem to be so self-evident as to be atheoretical, instead it carries profound theoretical impli- cations for theories of perception. Stoffre- gen and Bardy propose to consider percep- tion as driven by a single system whose parts operate as a unit to pick up information that is available only to that unit and not accomplished by a set of distinct percep- tual systems working in parallel (and often in conﬂict). Whether or not sensory specialization indeed exists is still an open question that goes beyond the aim of this chapter. In any case, the similarities and commonalities, as well as the differences, among touch, hear- ing, vision, taste, and smell suggest that the senses are better conceptualized as interre- lated modalities than as separate indepen- dent channels (Marks, 1978). Synaesthesia: The Relationship between Linguistic Description and Perceptual Experience The synaesthetic use of language must be distinguished from perceiving the world synaesthetically, a fairly infrequent experi- ence, as we will see. What cross-modal sim- ilarities and synaesthesia share is that prop- erties belonging to different modalities are systematically realigned in both cases (Marks, 1996), suggesting that, despite important dissimilarities, they might draw on similar underlying mechanisms (see the distinction between strong and weak forms of synaesthesia proposed by Martino & Marks, 2001). The fact that ordinary language has plenty of synaesthetic metaphors raised a fasci- nating and complex question: what is, if any, the relationship between perceptual metaphors and synaesthesia? Ramachandran and Hubbard suggested that the types of cross-sensorial induction typical of synaes- thetic perceptions and the directionality expressed in sensory metaphors are not arbitrarily established but based on “con- straints imposed by evolution and by neural hardware” (2003, 51). Consider the smell of nail polish: usually it is described as “sweet, even though we have never tasted it. This might involve close neural links and cross- activations between smell and taste (. . .). This would not only make sense function- ally – e.g., fruits are sweet and also smell ‘sweet’ like acetone – but also structurally: the brain pathways for smell and taste are closely intermingled and project to the same parts of the frontal cortex” (Ramachan- dran & Hubbard, 2003, 52). Hence, the cross-sensory correspondences experienced in synaesthesia and many of those described at a metaphorical language level would both reﬂect, at different levels, “hard-wired prop- erties of perceptual systems” (Marks, 1996, 43) that surface in perceptual experiences for synaesthetes, and in linguistic events for non-synaesthetes. To assess whether the mental processes that underlie cross-modal associations in real synaesthesia (that they term strong synaesthesia) apply to cross-modal process- ing as well, Martino and Marks (1999, 2001) designed a cross-modal selective attention task: a person is requested to respond to a stimulus in one modality (e.g., classifying a tone as high or low) while she or he is pre- sented with concurrent input from a differ- ent, unattended modality (e.g., a black or white square). If the unattended stimulus affects the response to the attended one, in that the intrusion of unattended stimuli into the elaboration of attended ones decreases the processing efﬁciency, then the two can be considered to interact. This happened to be the case. Furthermore, the nature of attended–unattended stimuli (i.e., their cross-modal similarity) affected the nature and intensity of the intrusion: participants were in fact faster at classifying high-pitched tones when matched with white squares than with black squares, and faster with low- pitched tones when accompanied by black (vs. white) squares. The “congruence effect” found in the cross-modal matches of attended and unat- tended stimuli can be accounted for by two hypotheses (Martino & Marks, 1999, 2000, 2001):\n432 CRISTINA CACCIARI 1. A “sensory hypothesis according to which congruence effects involve absolute cor- respondences processed within low- level sensory mechanisms (. . .) /that/ may arise from common properties in underlying neural codes” (2001, p. 64). Hence, cross-modal interactions would take place at an early perceptual stage prior to the engagement of linguistic or semantic mechanisms. 2. A “semantic coding hypothesis,” endorsed by the authors (and by Marks in pre- vious works), based on high-level post- sensory (semantic) mechanisms that develop over childhood from experi- ence with percepts and language (Marks, Hammeal, & Bornstein, 1987). The experienced relationships between sen- sory percepts and language would pro- duce an abstract semantic network that captures the synaesthetic correspon- dence common to dimensions of both modalities, and where sensory repre- sentations and cross-sensory similari- ties are amodally recoded (Martino & Marks, 1999). Differently from Martino and Marks (and from traditional theories of knowledge) that propose that sensory and linguistic stimuli are post-perceptually recoded into amodal representations, an alternative hypothesis can be proposed: such cross-modal matches might be produced by simultaneous activa- tion of low-level sensory mechanisms and of high-level post-sensory ones. Evidence sug- gesting that this might be the case comes from several sources (e.g., Barsalou et al., 2003; Cacciari, Massironi, & Corradini, 2004; Gentilucci et al., 2000; Stanﬁeld & Zwaan, 2001). For instance, integration between chromatic and linguistic informa- tion was recently shown in a study on the metaphorical use of color names in complex literary metaphors (Cacciari et al., 2004). Participants were asked to read short literary excerpts containing a color name metaphor- ically used to describe a character’s mental state. These brief texts were presented on a computer screen together with ﬁve shades of the appropriate color (e.g., yellow). Several tasks were employed: for instance, participants were asked to choose the shade expressively most appropriate to the narra- tive content or to rank the expressive ﬁtness of each of the ﬁve shades of color metaphor- ically used in the narrative. The color name– mental state correspondences did not corre- spond to any conventionalized association, and hence had to be computed afresh. We hypothesized that if the mental model read- ers formed exploited chromatic information, together with linguistic/conceptual informa- tion, then a consistent agreement in partic- ipants’ choices of the shade of color was to be expected. On the contrary, if the men- tal model was predominantly amodal, then a lower agreement if not a mere chance choice was predicted. Indeed, the ﬁrst happened to the case in that a very high and signiﬁ- cant consistency in the participants’ choices and rankings were obtained suggesting that participants indeed looked for the shade of color whose perceptual properties had the best expressive correspondence with the story content (see the article text for further details). This suggests that readers formed a complex mental model that took advantage of several sources of information integrating modal perceptual information with amodal linguistic-conceptual information (Cacciari et al., 2004). This evidence converges with that provided by Stanﬁeld and Zwaan (2001) in suggesting activation of perceptual infor- mation in language-related tasks. Stanﬁeld and Zwaan in fact showed that the mental representations of expressions such as He put the pencil into the cup and He put the pencil on the table included the pencil’s orientation, that is, vertical in the former and horizon- tal in the latter, even though this perceptual information was not explicitly available in the linguistic input. We now turn to consider real synaesthetic perceptions. SYNAESTHETIC PERCEPTION In synaesthesia, the stimulation of a sen- sory modality automatically triggers a per- ceptual experience generally in a differ- ent modality that has not been directly stimulated (Baron-Cohen & Harrison, 1997;\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 433 Baron-Cohen, Wyke, & Binnie, 1987; Baron- Cohen et al., 1993; Cytowic, 1989, 1997; Cytowic & Wood, 1982a, 1982b; Ramachan- dran & Hubbard, 2001a, 2001b, 2003). In its most diffuse version – colored-hearing, often referred to as photism – listening to particular sounds (e.g., a phoneme, a word) induces vivid perception of a given color. Other types of across-modalities or within- modality synaesthetic perceptions have been observed as well (e.g., phonemes with a spe- ciﬁc taste, geometrical forms with a smell or a taste; see Cytowic, 1999). As Cytowic pointed out, “Synaesthesia is not just a more intense form of cross-modal metaphor (. . .) being a vivid cross-modal association, synaesthesia is obviously a higher cortical function” (1989, 849). Many people can use cross-modal similar- ity statements to describe events or emotions but only synaesthetes “experience a real per- cept” (Cytowic & Wood, 1982a, 23). Synaes- thesia generally has a childhood onset and can be rarely acquired later in life as a result of brain injury or of a sensory deafferentia- tion (Grossenabacher & Lovelace, 2001). A case of acquired synaesthesia is described by Armel and Ramachandran (1999): a person developed retinitis pigmentosa in childhood and progressively lost his vision becoming completely blind at 40. Two years after, he started experiencing vivid synaesthesia in that tactile stimuli on the hand (Braille letters) evoked a vivid sensation of move- ment. Synaesthetic experiences must be also differentiated from those reported during ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., LSD, mescaline), or resulting from neurological pathologies. The ﬁrst medical reference to synaes- thesia was located at the beginning of the eighteenth century, when an English oph- thalmologist, Thomas Woolhouse, described a blind patient who perceived sound- induced colored visions (Cytowic, 1989, 1997, 1999). At the end of the seventeenth century, John Locke wrote of a man who had strange word–sound associations. Some years earlier (1704), sounds to color math- ematical connections were at the core of Newton’s work and based the invention of a “clavecin oculaire” (a clavichord simultane- ously playing sound and light). Although the phenomenon has been long known and has fascinated physicians, psychologists (e.g., Galton and Luria; see Osgood, 1980), artists (e.g., Kandinsky, Hockney), and writ- ers (e.g., Goethe, Verlaine, Baudelaire, Mau- passant, Nabokov), a full-ﬂedged deﬁni- tion of synaesthesia has been proposed only recently thanks to the development of brain imaging techniques and to the impressive amount of knowledge brought about by cognitive neuroscience (cf. Baron-Cohen & Harrison, 1997; Harrison & Baron-Cohen, 1997). Despite this, we still are far from a full understanding of the neural basis of synaesthesia. Four lines of experimental evidence con- verge to show the perceptual nature of synaesthesia that Ramachandran and Hub- bard (2001a) summarized with respect to its most diffuse form, grapheme-color induction, as follows: “(1) Synaesthetically induced colors can lead to perceptual group- ing, segregation, and pop-out. (2) Synaes- thetic colors are not seen with eccentric viewing even if numbers are scaled in size to make them clearly visible. (3) A crowded grapheme that is not consciously perceived can nevertheless evoke the corresponding color. (4) A color-blind synaesthete sees col- ors in numbers that he cannot otherwise see in real-life visual scenes” (p. 27). Despite attempts to formulate a uniﬁed approach to synaesthesia, there still is little evidence that a common underlying mech- anism can account for the heterogeneity of synaesthetic perceptions (Rich & Mat- tingly, 2002). Chances are that, as for many other neuro-cognitive phenomena, different cognitive mechanisms and markers will be identiﬁed for each type of synaesthetic expe- rience. Some authors suggested that work- ing intensively on the most diffuse forms of synaesthesia (e.g., colored perceptions aris- ing from orthographic or phonological pro- cessing of digits and letters) can be the right track for revealing the basic cognitive and neurophysiological underpinnings of other forms of synaesthetic experiences as well (Rich & Mattingly, 2002).\n434 CRISTINA CACCIARI The most important parameters used for describing synaesthesia in the neuro- science literature can be schematized as fol- lows (Cytowic, 1989; Frith & Paulesu, 1997; Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001; Harrison & Baron-Cohen, 1997; Paulesu et al., 1995; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001a, 2001b, 2003; Rich & Mattingly, 2002): 1. Origin: it generally initiates during childhood. 2. Automaticity: it is involuntary, charac- terized by awareness, and it can be sup- pressed only in highly speciﬁc condi- tions. 3. Realism: the sensations do not appear in the mind, but usually are perceived as real and discrete. 4. Speciﬁcity: the attributes of the associ- ated modality (the concurrent one, see below) are highly speciﬁc and memo- rable. 5. Prevalence: synaesthesia concerns at least 1 out of 2,000 persons (but there also are higher and lower estimates, depending on the classiﬁcation criteria); 6. Age: it is more frequent among children than adults. 7. Gender: it is six times more frequent among women than men. 8. Familiarity: there is a high prevalence among biological relatives, presumably due to a genetic predisposition transmit- ted by an X-linked autosomal dominant gene (Bailey & Johnson, 1997). Although synaesthetic perception is uni- tary, usually two interrelated components were identiﬁed (Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001): an inducing event (the “inducer” event) and the synaesthetically induced sen- sory attributes (“concurrent event”). For instance, in the case of a person reporting that the sound of her crying baby had an unpleasant yellow color, the sounds were the inducers that were experienced as having a concurrent color, together with their nor- mal auditory features [an induction usually schematized as (sound) →(color)]. For instance, consider the (digit) → (color) induction: one might wonder whether when shown the digit, the con- current color (or concurrent photism) is experienced in the synaesthete’s “mind’s eye” or externally projected on the inducer. For instance, Dixon et al. (2000) and Smilek et al. (2001) reported a case in which the color of the photism induced by a digit was externally projected: if shown a “4,” the synaesthete described a blue photism being seen “out there, on the page, overlaid on the top of the 4” and covering it. But a remarkable perceptual heterogeneity exists. For the vast majority of individuals, synaesthesia is unidirectional in that if a sound induces a color experience, the same color does not typically trigger the expe- rience of a sound, but “the relationship between inducers and concurrents is sys- tematic in that each speciﬁc concurrent is typically induced by only one inducer” (Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001, 36). Not all forms of synaesthesia span across two sen- sory modalities (cross-modal synaesthesia); some forms in fact exist in which the inducer and concurrent share a same modality, for instance, vision, as in the reading of visual letters of the alphabet that triggers the per- ception of colors (intramodal synaesthesia). It still is controversial the degree of pro- cessing of the inducer necessary for trigger- ing a synaesthetic perception: according to some authors (e.g., Mattingly et al., 2001; for an overview see Rich & Mattingly, 2002), the [(letter) →(color)] induction would take place at a relatively late stage of percep- tual processing, after selective attention is allocated, that is, following overt recogni- tion of the inducing stimulus. Hence, synaes- thetic colors would typically arise only for inducers that are represented at a con- scious level of visual processing (that might include meaning activation, if appropriate), being absent when a grapheme is visually masked, for instance. On the contrary, other researchers (e.g., Ramachandran & Hub- bard, 2001a, 2001b) found a perceptual link between inducer and concurrent even at a relatively early stage of perceptual anal- ysis, namely, before explicit identiﬁcation of the inducer stimulus. A related and still controversial issue is whether synaesthetic\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 435 experience arises automatically or under vol- untary control. The evidence collected using variants of the Stroop task10 converges to show that synaesthetic colors are automati- cally elicited by graphemic forms and are dif- ﬁcult to suppress, although inhibitory effects were observed under speciﬁc experimental conditions. We now turn to examine separately the characteristics of inducer and concurrent stimuli: 1. The inducers: many of them have a meaningful symbolic nature, as we already saw. Generally, inducers are sys- tematically associated with the same concurrent, but while the form of the inducer can change, the concurrent remains stable. If, for instance, seeing the letter “B” induces the perception of a particular shade of red, such color remains constant despite different hand- writing styles, font, or case. If listening to a voice reading aloud an alphabetic letter induces seeing it colored, it is irrel- evant whether the voice is feminine or masculine (Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001). Concurrent synaesthetic experi- ences can be induced through voluntary imagery of the inducer as well, that is, without direct exposure to the stimulus. It is well known that imagery involves many parts of the brain that are active also during visual perception. Since no physical stimulus is available and no afferent signals enter the cortex while imaging, this implies that synaesthesia can take place even with incomplete activation of the cascade of perceptual signaling propagated during visual per- ception. 2. The concurrents: it is quite rare to ﬁnd two people sharing a same color trig- gered by the same set of alphabetic letter. There is in fact a high inter- individual heterogeneity in concurrent stimuli.11 Despite this, given individ- ual concurrent stimuli are highly spe- ciﬁc and constant in time. They also are extremely memorable, as shown by a study where the consistency with which synaesthetes and non-synaes- thetes assigned color names to letters and words was investigated (Baron- Cohen et al., 1993). After one week, the control group remembered the color names only in 38% of the cases, while synaesthetes in 92% even a year later. Concurrent stimuli usually comprise simple features (e.g., a color) or com- bination of simple features much more than complex conﬁgurations (e.g., a face). Two main types of synaesthesia have been distinguished depending on the sensory or conceptual nature of the inducer (Grossen- bacher & Lovelace, 2001): while in “synaes- thetic perception,” the concurrent events are induced by experiencing speciﬁc sen- sory stimuli; in “synaesthetic conception,” the concurrent events are triggered by think- ing about speciﬁc concepts, as shown by a synaesthete for whom each of the 12 months of a year was located in a spa- tially organized colored conﬁguration. Sym- bolic levels of representation can in any case inﬂuence synaesthetic experiences, as shown in a case of “lexical–gustatory synaes- thesia,” where speciﬁc learned combina- tions of phonemes, but not environmental sounds, induced involuntary sensations of taste (Ward & Simner, 2003). Synaesthesia can even by triggered by the concept that underlies the inducer: Dixon et al. (2000) reported a case of a person for which the digit 7 elicited a yellow photism. Such color was automatically induced also when she was not presented with the digit but simply asked to calculate “5+ 2.” Hence, photism can also be concept driven, as shown by this case of arithmetic calculation. When considering the sense directionality of perceptual metaphors, I anticipated that also synaesthetic inductions are not equally distributed among the senses. As noted by Cytowic (1995), the ﬁve senses can have many but ﬁnite possible pairings; yet, some of them (e.g., sight and sound) are much more frequent than others. It is rare for smell and taste to be either the inducer or the con- current (see Cytowic, 1993, for “The man\n436 CRISTINA CACCIARI who tasted shapes”). Day (2006) analyzed 621 cases of synaesthesia reported in the lit- erature and found that 427 of them (68.8%) were (graphemes) →(color) inductions ver- sus only one case of (smell) →(taste). So far no uniﬁed account of the neural- cognitive basis of synaesthesia exists and dif- ferent, although not necessarily alternative, hypotheses have been proposed. They can be summarized as follows: 1. Synaesthesia derives from anoma- lous cross-wiring between brain areas that subserve the sensory modalities involved (e.g., between area V4 and the number area in the fusiform gyrus; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001a, 2001b). This could be due to the survival of links among cortical sensory systems that used to be connected at birth in human infants (as in other species) but are normally disconnected after the neonatal stage (Baron-Cohen, 1996; Maurer, 1997): the neonatal synaesthesia hypothesis (Maurer, 1997) in fact posits that all babies are synaes- thetic up to some point of their early life (approximately, up to about four months of age) in that they experience sensory inputs in an undifferentiated way. Alternatively, synaesthesia would result either from a partial failure in the normal pruning process that eliminates these cross-modal connections, or from the sprouting of additional synaptic connections resulting in a cross-wiring among areas (Baron-Cohen et al., 1993; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001a, 2001b). In any case, adult synaesthesia would represent a breakdown in the process of modularization (Baron- Cohen et al., 1993). 2. The close anatomic proximity of visual and auditory pathways might be at the origin of “leaks” among pathways, so that auditory information leaks into path- ways and areas that ordinarily deal with visual information. 3. Synaesthesia might result from abnor- mal feedback in existing neural path- ways (Grossenbacher, 1997; Grossen- bacher & Lovelace, 2001; Smilek et al., 2001). More speciﬁcally, it could be due to a process of neural communication, of cross-talk of brain regions, that has its origin in feed-forward signals in the inducer neural representation and cul- minates in activation of the otherwise independent concurrent representation via feedback signals (based on pathways convergence). 4. Synaesthesia is subserved by areas located in the left-brain hemisphere and “is accompanied by large metabolic shifts away from the neocortex that result in relatively enhanced limbic expression. The hippocampus is an important and probably obligate node in whatever neural structures generates the synaesthetic experience” (Cytowic, 1995, 8; see also Cytowic, 1989, 1997). As Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001a, 2001b) noted, in the past synaesthesia was often dismissed as childhood memories or confused with a “mere metaphor,” “an exam- ple of the classic fallacy of trying to explain an enigma (synaesthesia) with a mystery (metaphor)” (2001a, 982). On the contrary, “understanding synaesthesia (a concrete per- ceptual effect the anatomical locus of which can be potentially pinned down) can provide an experimental level for understanding the neural basis of metaphors” (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001a, 982). Beyond Synaesthesia The general view underlying this chapter is that metaphorical language is pervaded by cross-modality references that mirror, at a linguistic level, our neural architecture (Marks, 1996; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001a, 2001b). To provide further evidence, let us consider some additional examples of multimodal processing in the brain. The human brain, together with that of other non-human primates, can form many types of cross-sensory integra- tions aside from synaesthesia: one is related to the integration of visual–tactile\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 437 representations of a speciﬁc portion of the visual space that surrounds the body, the peripersonal space (for an overview, see Ladavas, 2002). Neuropsychological studies showed that an integrated system exists that controls both visual and tactile inputs within the peripersonal space around the face and the hand. Such a system is functionally separated from the one that controls visual information in the extrapersonal space. This implies that our visual experience of a body part is intrinsically linked with the experience of touch, as it had been described for arm amputees who reported vivid tactile sensations in the phantom arm when they saw the experimenter touching the mirror image of their normal arm (Ramachandran & Rogers-Ramachandran, 1996). A speciﬁc case of sensory integration between language and actions has been extensively investigated by Rizzolati and col- leagues (for an overview, see Rizzolati & Arbib, 1998; Arbib & Rizzolati, 1996). These authors showed that the human motor sys- tem becomes active during observation of gestures made by others and that Broca’s area and the left temporal lobe are consis- tently activated during action observation. This ﬁnding originates from a set of previous studies showing that a speciﬁc part of ventral premotor cortex (area F5) in monkeys con- tains neurons that discharge both when the monkey grasps an object and when she or he observes the experimenter making a sim- ilar gesture. The neurons endowed with this property were called “mirror neurons” and were considered to provide representations used for both imitating and comprehend- ing actions. Such a mirror system for ges- ture recognition was found in human brain close to Broca’s area and considered as the human homologue of the F5 area in mon- keys. The motor properties of human Broca’s areas were observed in a set of PET studies that showed that such areas became active during the execution of hand or arm move- ments, during mental imagery of hand grasp- ing movements, and during mental rotations of the hand (for an overview, see Rizzolatti & Arbib, 1998). Gentilucci et al. (2000) showed that the motor program relative to grasping an object was modiﬁed by the presence of a written linguistic label located on the to-be-grasped object specifying an extrinsic or intrinsic property (e.g., “near,” “far,” “big,” “small”): the kinematics of the initial phase of reach- ing and grasping an object were affected by the word meaning suggesting that a cogni- tive function, word processing, can inter- vene in visuo-motor transformations. That motor-related concepts can be conceived of as multisensory memories was recently argued by Oliveri et al. (2004) and Pul- verm¨uller, Lutzenberger, & Preissl (1999) who showed that the motor schemata asso- ciated with a given action word are “embed- ded within its cortical representation, and are activated automatically whenever that word is retrieved” (Oliveri et al., 2004, 377). Using a brain stimulation technique (TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation), Oliv- eri et al. observed that the left primary motor cortex was maximally and much more acti- vated during the retrieval of action verbs and action-related nouns (e.g., “to throw,” “the key”) than of non-action-related words (e.g., “to belong,” “the cloud”), even when the par- ticipants were not in any way instructed to consider the meaning of the words. Hence, the cortical regions activated by words refer- ring to actions were shown to comprise regions encoding information that is not purely linguistic or conceptual but reﬂect the sensorimotor properties associated with the concept underlying them. To Conclude: On Language Conventionality and “Hard-Wired” Motivation Many cross-sensory expressions are so com- mon in language that one might doubt that they still are perceived as non-literal. For instance, saying of a pain that it is sharp seems as literal as saying that it is intense, since “double-function” adjectives (Asch, 1958) like “sharp” are commonly used to modify a variety of dimensions, as already noted by Aristotle in the De Anima. As\n438 CRISTINA CACCIARI Figure 24.2. “Takete” (a) and “Maluma” (b) (Koehler, 1947). Miller and Johnson-Laird stated, “Perhaps it is a mistake to think that the concept expressed by a word like ‘sharp’, which can describe touch, taste, sound, intelligence, terrain, strictness, eagerness, and objects is legitimately applicable only to touch and must be generalized for other applications” (1976, 360). A sharp mind “may be as good an instance of SHARP as a sharp pain; a warm person may be as good an instance of WARM as a warm tactual experience” (Miller & Johnson-Laird, 1976, p. 360). But polysemy mostly originates from metaphorical language. As several authors noted (e.g., Nunberg, 1979; Sweetser, 1991), generally words do not acquire new senses randomly but according to a “cognitive struc- turing” that relates them in a motivate fashion: “linguistic categorization depends not just on our naming distinctions that exist in the world, but also on our metaphorical and metonymical structuring of our percep- tions of the world” (Sweetser, 1991, 9). An example of a cross-modal correspon- dence not conventional at all was pro- vided by Koehler (1947; see also Lindauer, 1990, 1991; Werner, 1963) that presented participants with two meaningless visual shapes (see Figure 24.2) and asked them to pair each shape with either the linguis- tic label Takete or with Maluma. The par- ticipants unambiguously associated the one with sharp changes in the visual directions of the lines (a) with Takete and the rounded one (b) with Maluma even though they had never seen these stimuli before. Since then, many studies replicated such effect with variants of the original visual shapes of Koehler. One of the most credited interpretations of this form-to-sound match is based on the link between phonemic and perceptual– geometrical properties (see Bozzi & Flores d’Arcais, 1967): as also recently argued by Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001b), the sharp changes in the visual directions of the lines in the angular ﬁgure mimic the sharp inﬂections of the sound as well as the move- ments of the tongue on the palate.12 The two visual forms and labels act via diverse sensory systems (sight and audition) but are treated as similar and put into correspondence on the basis of one or more shared cross-modal properties. According to Gestalt psychologists, the visual forms and the phonemes form- ing the linguistic labels share an evoca- tive trait, namely, a “tertiary” property (or “physiognomic”; see Werner, 1963). Accord- ing to Gestalt psychologists, in fact, objects possess three different kinds of property: 1. Primary properties that are objective, measurable, and independent from the perceiver (e.g., form, extension). It is the world described by natural sciences. 2. Secondary properties that are percep- tually tied to an observer’s activity and are mediated by sense organs (e.g., color, sound). 3. Tertiary or expressive properties that belong to the object although they are perceived by the individual as part of his/her experience: they are not “occa- sional emotional vibrations, but the contribution of emotion to the cog- nitive side of perception” (Massironi, 2000, 12).\nCROSSING THE SENSES IN METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE 439 In this vein, the expressive properties of the sharp sound of Takete and of the angu- lar shape had a better ﬁt than those of Maluma with the same geometrical form (Bozzi, 1990; Marks, 1996). Expressive properties span all over the perceptual world for Gestalt psychologists and are as real as shape or color. Like- wise, Gibson’s affordances (1979) were not seen as emotional projections or experience- based associations but as real, objective, and physical properties contained in the opti- cal array: “a postbox ‘invites’ the mailing of a letter, the handle ‘wants to be grasped’ and things ‘tell us what to do with them’” (Gibson, 1979, 77). As Marks (1996) argued, many, if not all, cross-modal similarities expressed in metaphorical language might reﬂect “natu- ral correspondences between experiences in different sense modalities (. . .) that seem to be nothing less than ‘hard-wired’” (Marks, 1996, 61). This is one of the reasons why trying to explain these linguistic metaphors as assertions of similarity between sen- sory events would prove useless: what in fact motivates the existence, and system- aticity, of some metaphorical correspon- dences and excludes others? Once again, confusing metaphors with similes, trans- forming metaphors into “is-like” statements, leaves the problem unexplained (Glucks- berg, 2001, and in this volume; Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990). Language, be it literal or metaphori- cal, can construct a perceptual scenario that might even substitute the correspond- ing perceptual reality. As shown in Lan- dau and Gleitman’s study (1985) on the acquisition of visual verbs by sighted and blind children, the verbs “look” and “see” are acquired as if “the meaning compo- nent ‘visual’ is never encoded in the syn- tax of these verbs, which is observable by both the blind and the sighted children, but rather is learned from extralinguistic observation alone, which varies for the blind and sighted children” (Fisher, Gleitman, & Gleitman, 1992, 377). On a literary ground, the capacity of linguistic descriptions to construct, better replace, perceptual real- ity gave raise to the fortune of a literary genre, of the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, “le r´ecit de voyage” (travel narra- tive). Famous writers (e.g., Goethe, Stend- hal) mostly traveling in Italy described still untouched Italian landscapes to their con- temporaries contributing with painters to create an imaginary country of Roman and Greek ruins, old palaces, and volcanoes. When we see Turner’s drawing of the Canal Grande in Venice, or read Ruskin’s descrip- tion of the palaces lining along it, we are aware that these are (gorgeous) represen- tations of a perceptual scenario, Venice, that might or might not resemble the real Venice. Many, maybe not all, sensory-based metaphors go beyond this illusory effect being something different from an “intru- sion” of language into the perceptual world since they indeed reﬂect the structure of perceptual experience, of semantic mem- ory, and of the neural circuits subserving them. At the beginning of this chapter, I stated my working hypothesis as follows: metaphorical language expressing sensory experiences does not reﬂect an abstract– amodal combination of word senses, but rather the neural endowment necessary for treating sensory information. I tried to show that this might be the case examining direct as well as indirect sources of evi- dence (synaesthesia and multisensory expe- rience). Neurosciences offer an extraordi- nary opportunity to investigate metaphors for what they might concretely be, lin- guistic bridges between the mind and the brain. Notes 1 This chapter is dedicated to Paolo Bozzi (1933–2003). Part of the ideas illustrated in this chapter was ﬁrst presented in Cacciari (1998, 2004). 2 I will refer to sensory and perceptual metaphors as if the two adjectives were synonymous. I only consider linguistic metaphors, but, of course, there also are cases of nonlinguistic perceptual metaphors (e.g., caricatures).\n440 CRISTINA CACCIARI 3 The Physiology of Taste. Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy. 4 I owe this deﬁnition to Paolo Bozzi. 5 This applies to other senses as well (e.g., the taste of a peach, the sound of a bell) that nonetheless have a variety of generic terms (Boisson, 1997). 6 Many other instances of the reduced abil- ity of language to name perceptual expe- riences are offered by spatial language. Landau and Jackendoff (1993) extensively investigated it showing that language ﬁl- ters out representations of spatial properties and relationships. For instance, dimensional adjectives (e.g., big/small, thick/thin) refer to continuous dimensions, but the linguis- tic expressions bifurcate them into binary contrasts. 7 Other forms of ﬁgurative language as well can exploit perceptual language, for instance, idiomatic expressions, proverbs, and oxymora, but I will mostly consider metaphors. 8 I thank Umberto Eco for this observation. 9 I thank Sam Glucksberg for this observation. 10 In the standard Stroop task, participants must name the color of the ink in which words are written. 11 The inter-synaesthetes heterogeneity led Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001a) to dif- ferentiate between higher and lower forms of synaesthesia based on the attentional– cognitive triggers of synaesthetic perceptions (e.g., required focused attention), and on the neuroanatomical loci of cross-activation observed in the brain of higher and lower synesthetes. 12 This raises an interesting question concerning sound symbolism that goes beyond the aim of the chapter.

Kennedy Ron Eady is a Canadian encaustic painter with a studio in the hamlet of Rosseau, Ontario, two hours drive north of Toronto. With a friend, Frances, to whom I had been describing Eady’s noir work, I walked by and pointed out the single poster outside the studio. It showed one of Eady’s paintings (Figure 25.1). Frances immediately said, “I see what you mean.” In the picture, a thin man has turned to face us, arms by his sides. A sharp-nosed face with dark eye sockets stares directly at us. His heavily textured body sheds elements into the surrounds. The result is disquieting, odd. How does this unnerving poster do its work? It did not have the picture’s title – “Lost (Stickman).” The picture alone was enough. A shedding textured ﬁgure is not made of ordinary ﬂesh and blood. Alive, con- fronting us, it may be nearly dead. Eady’s pictures have incomplete buildings, mounds of twigs, dark-blue water, dense forest, shad- owy ﬁgures glimpsed through windows, and mirrors reﬂecting impassive faces over taps and washbasins. They are sinister and com- pelling at ﬁrst glance. Eady’s pictures conjure metaphor from objects, geometries, lines, and contours. Indeed, as will become clear, art’s devices cut broadly across cognition and the senses, in ways likely to be remarkably universal. I will contend pictures are prototypical art objects, and pictures have to use perceptual tactics that are realistic, so violations of real- ism in art are readily taken to be metaphors. The general principle at work here is that metaphor violates standard representational practice. However, the limits on pictures as representations are stricter than those on words. The result is that metaphors can fail in one and succeed in the other. Indeed, the differences in the limits are so marked that ultimately I will claim on the one hand that “art objects can be metaphors” is a metaphor, and on the other that it is an enormously successful one, as true as any metaphor can be. Helpfully, arguments lead- ing to this result reveal in plain fashion how representations indicate features of objects in language and pictures, in metaphors and in mental imagery. A discussion of metaphor in art can set a good example. Much colorful, intriguing talk 447\n448 JOHN M. KENNEDY Figure 25.1. Ron Eady’s “Lost (Stickman).” about metaphor, and art, is dearly in need of being uncloaked to the point where the literal features supporting metaphors become evident. The base machinery of comprehension is not found by tracing one metaphor to another or by reference to conventional or familiar sayings. Com- prehension occurs when we know what features are attributed to a topic. Just so, as a case in point, my goal here is to use art to show what must be literal in metaphor. Clear Examples of Violations of Realism The core argument for this chapter is basically this. “The guard’s heart is a stone” violates the standard, literal use of stone. It relies on features stone has in common with the villain (Chiappe, Kennedy, & Smykowski, 2003). Likewise, art’s metaphors rely on features in com- mon to devices and their referent. Often the use runs counter to standard uses of the devices, as, for example, Figure 25.2 has shapes of straight spokes of a wheel playfully altered. Five wheels are shown. One suggests a wheel in steady spinning motion, one shows a static wheel, one a wobbly wheel, one a wheel in jerky motion, one a wheel spinning too fast to make out, and one a wheel with its brakes on. Of interest, the wheels are iden- tiﬁed in similar fashion by blind adults using raised line pictures and the sighted using printed pictures (Kennedy & Gabias, 1985). Steady spin is suggested to both groups of subjects by curved spokes, static by straight spokes, wobbly by wavy spokes, jerky by bent spokes, too fast to make out by dashed spokes, and brakes-on by spokes extended beyond the wheel’s perimeter. These are not pictorial onomatopoeia, in the fashion of murmuring sounding like its referent, for they do not give the impression of motion, but each form and motion have a use- ful feature in common. For example, wob- bly motion is relatively smooth and varies in direction, while jerky motion changes abruptly. Not only are the meanings of the wheels the same for the blind and the sighted, when blind and sighted subjects were asked to order the wheels from most to least suc- cessful in terms of which suggest steady spin, both groups put curved ﬁrst, bent sec- ond, wavy third, dashed next, and extended spokes last. This is impressive for both groups were unfamiliar with the particular devices, and the blind were unfamiliar with depictions of any kind. It seems unrealis- tic representations can be effective by shar- ing relevant features (Vervaeke & Kennedy, 2004). What is salient in them seems highly reliable (Giora, 2003). Gombrich (1963, 1972) commented that there can be no question of realism or naturalistic representation in these devices. There are intuitions to be uncovered here\nMETAPHOR AND ART 449 Figure 25.2. Wheels suggesting motions – spinning, wobbly, jerky, too fast to make out, and brakes on. Reprinted with permission from Kennedy and Gabias (1985). about pictures, what their standard use should be and what might be pertinent in an unrealistic picture (Arnheim, 1974). Behind a serious-faced man in a busi- ness suit, a picture might have his reﬂection be that of a naked prancing devil, reveal- ing two sides of his nature. An obese reli- gious leader can be shown tucking into a banquet while half-hidden, dwarfed in his giant shadow, gaunt children huddle round begging bowls. We are meant to take these pictures as metaphoric comments on states of affairs. In Jean-Honore Fragonard’s “The Bolt” (ca. 1778), a strong bare-legged man holds his inamorata fast while stretching out to slide home a bolt locking a bedroom door. She is yielding while protesting. In the folds of the drapes of the four-poster bed, the careful Louvre viewer can discern massive and bold sexual imagery, anticipating events of the near future. Fragonard’s intention is entirely undeniable. The shapes are there for all to see, though many see cloth and noth- ing more. The picture is proleptic, meaning it anticipates the future. It is a double enten- dre, or perhaps in this case one should say a double voir. Expression in Eady’s “Lost,” comic-book wheels, political caricatures of business and religious leaders and disguised eroticism are grist for theory of metaphor and art. Here we try to deﬁne the population these pic- tures sample and their rules. What must be defended is that perception of the nat- ural world is in some sense realistic (Gibson, 1979), and therefore pictures can be realistic or metaphoric. Finally, how metaphoric pic- tures relate to cognition – concepts, exam- ples, and claims – needs to be described. A word on vocabulary: metaphor in ordinary English, as in “I was speaking metaphorically,” covers many ﬁgurative ex- pressions, including exaggeration, under- statement, and irony. The technical term for all ﬁgures of speech is trope, but it is odd to say, “I spoke tropely.” Using metaphor (a type of trope) to stand for trope is catachre- sis, the use of a term to stand in for one that does not exist in many people’s every- day lexicon. A popular catachresis is “he fell in love” because we have no simple verb for becoming in love. In metonymy, a part (such as metaphor) stands for the whole (in this case, trope). Technically, this chapter could be entitled “trope in art” or “trope in pic- tures.” It is about ﬁgures of representation, tropes not restricted to language. “My job is a jail” uses jail as a typi- cal member of the category “unpleasantly conﬁning situations” (Gentner & Bowdle, 2001; Glucksberg, 2001), much as metaphor can stand for trope. If pictures convey messages metaphorically, representational dance, sculpture, mime, design, and movies can be metaphoric. Pictures are prototypical examples of art, much as metaphors are of tropes. Literal Pictures Are Realistic A literal picture shows a scene and uses devices as they are in standard practice. Lit- eral pictures must conform to standards. However, since pictures vary all over the map in style, the standards could be mere conventions (Kennedy, 2002; Sacks, 2002). That pictures are not purely conventional will have to become clear in what follows, or the notion of a metaphoric picture violat- ing signiﬁcant standards would be suspect. Pictures can be realistic even when they depict an imaginary scene, for example,\n450 JOHN M. KENNEDY the Toronto CN Tower as beside Niagara Falls. This is simply wrong, not metaphoric, like the statement, “Mounties ride camels.” Metaphor requires a claim that has two meanings, one a standard use of terms and another making a point via features of the standard referent of the terms. The second meaning is not meant to correct the stan- dard one, as “DNA uses a double helix” did when it ﬁrst appeared. Metaphor is a play on expression itself, pro tem, like a quotation. Similarly, metaphoric pictures play on pic- turing itself, in effect alluding to another way of using a pictorial device, to make a point about the topic. A metaphoric illustration for a Freudian text may show a man made of sexual imagery to make a point about unconscious drives. The topic is man, and the vehicle the sexual pictures. A picture of a man made of fruit or animals may be clev- erly done but have no point to make about the man. It is not metaphoric. Natural Laws Are Standards That Can Be Transgressed If a rule is violated, there is a standard. Literal pictures follow discoveries from the dawn of picturing. A mere thousand generations ago, a tick on evolution’s time scale, cave pictures arrived. They capitalize on preexisting, eons- old ways of perceiving the world. The visual system Darwin evolved for us over millennia is used in part by pictures. To see the world, vision uses optic input from surfaces, edges, shadows, shapes of objects, and perspectives dictated by the observer’s vantage points. Pictures use con- tours, lines, and patches on surfaces to re-create the key features of this highly infor- mative optic input. Vision is largely the ser- vant of rich, physical optic laws. Pictures piggyback on these laws. Typically, what metaphors do in pic- tures is violate two kinds of laws. One kind governs what confronts us every day. Frag- onard violates the rules of bed drapery by painting two huge organic sexual forms in their folds. The bedroom is an apt place, but what is present as cloth is a physical anomaly. The second kind governs surfaces and edges. For example, spokes of wheels are not bent by jerky motion. The shape is another phys- ical anomaly. In literal pictures, contours, lines, and patches depict in surprisingly few ways. We see because of surfaces reﬂecting light to us. Surfaces enclose matter, and so fronts face a vantage point and rears face away, with edges between fronts and backs. Contours depict the edges, and the region bounded by contours stands for the surface. Con- tours depict occluding edges of ﬂat surfaces like a rooﬂine, occluding bounds of curved surfaces like brows of hills, and the edge of one surface meeting another at a corner (Figure 25.3). Lines depict the same surface layouts. A line has two contours and so in addition it can depict a wire (two occluding surface edges close together) or a crack (two surface edges on either side of a gap). Lines and contours give us vivid impres- sions of the scene surfaces – so realistic at times even a line drawing can deceive the observer into thinking the real thing is present (Kennedy, 1974; Kubovy, 1986). The strong afﬁnity between contours and surface edges allows any other use of line and con- tour to be distinct, and plausibly nonliteral, as in Figure 25.4 by Esref, a congenitally, totally blind man, drawing wheels in motion (Kennedy & Merkas, 2000), for his ﬁrst time. Esref deploys lines for wirelike forms and other referents. Esref’s lines in air behind a wheel depict its path of motion, or its wind. His incomplete wheel perimeters on either side of a braking wheel aptly sug- gest shuddering, but there are no incomplete rims ﬂanking braking wheels. Spokes do not become circles when the wheel rotates fast. The ground is not wavy under a wobbly wheel. The shapes of wobbly wheels do not become elliptical in keeping with the arc of the ground. The ground does not become dashed under a jerky wheel, shown twice, once turning and once still. Each astonishingly creative picture takes a property such as line length, number of wheels, orientation, location, and shape and\nMETAPHOR AND ART 451 Figure 25.3. Surface edges depicted by lines. pairs it with a motion property. Lines to one side of a wheel suggest a direction of motion. Line length suggests speed of motion, and line shape a path of motion. Asked about such devices, blind people judge them to be imaginary and not realistic. When pressed to decide if they are literal or metaphoric they plump for metaphoric (Kennedy, 1993). Theory That Edge Depiction by Contours and Lines Gives Universal Impressions In convention theory, pictures are entirely arbitrary. But lines trigger impressions of edges. To understand how, it is helpful to note that lines do not convey impressions of any visual borders, for example, line fails to Figure 25.4. Wheels drawn by Esref. Reprinted with permission from Kennedy and Merkas (2000).\n452 JOHN M. KENNEDY Figure 25.5. Head in shape-from-shadow, shown via a contour and copied as a line. Reprinted with permission from Kennedy and Bai (2004). give impressions of color and shadow bor- ders. To come to grips with this point, consider borders on surfaces as opposed to borders of surfaces. The striped ﬂanks of a zebra vary in reﬂectance. A stripe’s borders can be copied in an outline drawing but the interior of the stripe will not look dark. The zebra may cast a shadow on the ground, and its ﬂanks curve downward away from the sun to bear attached shadows. Line copies of borders of the shadows on the ground and ﬂank will not produce percepts of shaded regions. In contrast, contours of dark regions can depict zebra stripes with excellent visual mimicry, and copy margins of the shadows to give rise to percepts of extended shad- ows and the complex surfaces on which they lie. A face in partial shadow in Figure 25.5 is perceived because the contours trigger adroit shape-from-shadow analysis in vision. Outlining the shadow patches does not trig- ger the analysis, as Figure 25.5 shows. One reason: the line has two contours, a positive and a negative, and the negative blocks the analysis the positive might otherwise sup- port (Kennedy & Bai, 2004). Contours look like surface edges for obvi- ous reasons. A dark surface against a bright background has a continuous border, and a continuous contour on a picture surface has too. Explanation cannot stop there for a dot- ted line can also depict a continuous surface edge, in vision or touch. Perception groups dots as continuous, like stitching revealing the presence of a continuous thread. Dots can be seen as lying on a continuous sur- face like freckles on a forehead. A cloud of gnats (or a school of ﬁsh or a ﬂock of birds) swarming can seem like one writhing snake- like body. Continuous edges are suggested by the stitching at a border, the freckles aligned at the border of the forehead, and the gnats at the cloud’s perimeter. That is, dotted lines on a page and texture at a surface edge trig- ger the same perceptual alignments. Perceptual functions triggered by dots, lines, and contours help the perceiver detect real surfaces. Taking advantage of these nat- ural laws, lines, and contours in pictures trigger perceived surfaces. Metaphors for motion violate the laws. What goes for motion goes for smell, taste, surprise, pain, heat, and the like in comic-book devices originating in the 19th century (Kennedy, 1993). Wavy lines above garbage stand for smells. Spiky lines around a swollen thumb stand for pain. About representing motion, Cutting (2002) noted “the purpose of these represen- tations is not to trick the visual system into seeing motion; instead it is merely to suggest to an observer, sometimes a well-informed one, that motion has occurred” (p. 1190). The devices share a pertinent feature with the referent. Cutting writes that they often\nMETAPHOR AND ART 453 use what Arnheim (1974) called dynamic balance (objects are depicted with asymme- try), multiple images (as in Esref’s device for jerky motion, and Marcel Duchamps’ famed “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2,” of the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s Annen- berg Collection), afﬁne shear (the object leans forward), photographic blur, and Fig- ure 25.3’s action lines. Motion is not bal- ance, multiplication, leaning, blur, or trailing lines, but these suggest motion, that is, are metaphors for it. Cutting’s list is not exhaustive. Devices have many features, and if the desired refer- ent changes what part of a device is useful changes in its wake. All of this is customary, but none of it is due to custom. That lines and contours show surface edges was discovered by cave artists (Kennedy & Silver, 1974). The Songe of Papua/New Guinea, a small tribe of about 300 people, do not have pictures in their culture, but they recognize outline drawings of trees, houses, birds, and people on ﬁrst exposure to them (Kennedy & Ross, 1975). It follows that other uses of line and contour could be meant to communicate in a nonlit- eral fashion. Form Symbolism Relies on Matching Features of a Form and the Referent As motion-representation tests metaphori- cal use of lines, forms such as circles and squares can test symbolic functions. Ping and pong can be matched with sweet (ping) and sour (pong), or high and low, or cat and elephant (Gombrich, 1996). A similar game can be played with circle and square (Liu & Kennedy, 1996). One is soft and one is hard. Overwhelmingly, people match circle with soft and square with hard (100% agreement from Toronto undergradu- ates). Similarly, most match circle with good and square with evil (89%). Most pair strong with square and weak with circle (79%). Gombrich (1996, p. 140) wrote: When my father, hard and square Met me with a frosty stare What a comfort I then found In my mother, soft and round. Levels of agreement vary from unani- mous to random. That circle is summer and square winter is somewhat unsure (81% agreement). That circle is cat and square is dog is questioned by many (only 74%). Quiet (circle) and loud (square) are at just 62%. Near and far are randomly assigned to circle and square (53%), like deep and shal- low (51%). Correlation of the levels of agreement is highly signiﬁcant when English speakers are compared with Japanese, Danish, and Slovene speakers (Kennedy et al., 2003). The informants assigned circle on its own to either soft and hard, happy or sad, love or hate, bright or dark, alive or dead, and so on, and square on its own to the same refer- ents to show circle on its own being selected frequently, for one of the options, predicted square being selected for the opposite, in each language group. In no two languages did circle and square have the same slang referents, for example, “my father is a real square” is not found in Danish and “en ﬁrkant” in Danish is a demanding person, who does not fall in line and agree with us, declined as I am well- informed, you have opinions, but he is “saa ﬁrkant.” A telling ﬁnding is that the highest levels of agreement were across language. Selec- tions for square by the Japanese and Slovenes were correlated .9. Danes selecting options for circle did not always select the opposite for square (correlation –.62) but selections for circle by Japanese and square by Danes correlated –.77. Theory of metaphor as feature match- ing accounts for the results as follows. The form symbolizes the referent by means of features such as smooth, continuous, sharp- cornered, and stable (Arnheim, 1974; Liu & Kennedy, 1997). For example, sharp corners are dangerous and so is evil. Squares are sta- ble, and circles easily rolled, offering weak resistance to sideways pressure. If a salient feature is in common to the form and its ref- erent, there is a high level of agreement. If a\n454 JOHN M. KENNEDY nonsalient feature has to be sought, the sub- ject is slow and unsure, rivalrous features are entertained, and deciding between them is fairly slow and effortful (Giora, 2003). Few Geometries Are General but Objects Have Many Features, Some Apocryphal Perspective is general in perception because we have to perceive shadow from some- where, because to see we need illumination. Being general, any special use will be quite evident. For example, once linear per- spective was mastered, the vanishing point was frequently used for emphasis. It is con- venient to put a major ﬁgure there and to arrange others on either side like supports. This was common in Italy in the 16th cen- tury (Kubovy, 1986). Shadow can be used to similar effect, to surround a central source of light. In the 1600s, paintings of interiors often depicted faces in memorable fashion around a single candle, in close-up, one face youthful, shadowy regions surrounding the lit center. Lighting a single candle against the night is not to be gainsaid. Youth is a candle, ﬁguratively. Despair is the night, metaphor- ically. A few principles govern perspective and shadow, but the objects to which they apply are numberless. Like Lego toys, objects are combinations of elements (surfaces), and the elements can be added or taken away ad inﬁnitum. For example, we can invent a new alphabet. Perception is open to new objects and new uses of old objects, some adamantly related to the properties of the object and some purely conventional. Vicari (1993) has given an excellent account of an art movement stemming from the early 1500s that invested depicted objects such as labyrinths with metaphoric signiﬁcance. A labyrinth meant voluptuous- ness in one picture, accompanied by an explanation in an epigram. Pipe and tobacco in a Dutch book by Daniel Heinsius, printed in 1615, had a Latin exposition to the effect that love is but a fume and lovers live on air. The title for the movement is Emblem- atica. As it spread, it became learned and instructional. As a sign of being educated, it became important to know the proper meanings of emblems. Falcons, in one tra- dition, meant eternity. A goose meant a son. A vulture stood for mother. The prin- ciple behind the movement was that every- thing in nature had signiﬁcance. Everything meant something else, but often it did so for spurious reasons. Vulture meant mother because of a belief that there were no male vultures. Goose meant son in Emblematica because it was thought that the Egyptian words for goose and son had the same sound. This was not a metaphoric link. But many other uses of a character such as a lion had a metaphoric character. A lion can mean the king because traditionally it is the king of beasts or gold because gold is the king of metals. It can also mean a heretical blasphemer because of its evil-smelling mouth. A motto accompanying the picture in a given publication picked out properties from our ideas about lions. Vicari reports that in 1522 Alciati, the writer of Emblematica’s ﬁrst major volume, noted the movement could take something from history or nature after which painters and goldsmiths could fashion badges and insignia. These could be worn in hats for example and be accompanied by precepts. He noted the design of a dolphin twined around an anchor meaning both speed and stability would be a hieroglyph for “make haste slowly.” In 1548, Vicari recounts, emblems were recommended for walls of a house, window glass, wall hangings, cur- tains, tableware, seals for documents, signet rings, personal attire, parts of furniture such as bedposts, and weapons. A modern would ﬁnd this obsessional. Vicari offers an interpretation of a painting by Dossi entitled “Portrait of an Unknown Young Man.” A man points outside a window where an ass is eating this- tles. The little scene is an emblem that refers to Aesop’s fable in which an ass loaded with a sack of the best oats and barley eats this- tles as if nothing better was available. This\nMETAPHOR AND ART 455 fable is about a miser who starves himself amid plenty, too mean to spend. But surely, what his money symbolizes is his talents, his unwillingness to dream, to hope, to bring about a great future. Ultimately, the emblem is about an inability to love and care wisely for self and others. Emblematica is an elaborate tissue of literary allusions. Rich and rewarding, it was largely to do with what is arbitrary, though it had an idea that the divine put meaning into nature coded. It was partly inspired by texts on Egyptian lore, which were eventually discovered to be clever ﬁc- tions. Overburdened by dictionaries of arbi- trary meanings, such as a crocodile is hyp- ocritical (shedding crocodile tears), it fell gradually into disfavor. Its raison d’ˆetre is also still present in eagles, beavers, kangaroos, and kiwis standing for countries and sports teams – handy summaries, indispensable in a visual age. Political cartoons still use these along with cornucopias and hourglasses, lions, and labyrinths. Greeting cards still use cupids and darts. The pictures of Emblematica are “encoded allusions to literary sources . . . the interpreter must know to what discourses they allude” (Vicari, 1993, p. 162). The text accompanying emblems was often itself enigmatic. “An emblematic image, there- fore, is indirectly a visual metaphor by way of an allusion to a literary source, or perhaps we might say a metaphor for a text which in itself is already ﬁgural – metaphoric or metonymic. It is a metalepsis – a meta- phor for a metaphor” (p. 162). Awkward Metaphors in Pictures Despite Success in Words Besides being apt or arbitrary, metaphoric pictures may fail. For example, love’s emblems can be gauche in pictures. It is a ﬁne thing in language to have a burning passion. The loved one can stoke the ﬁres with one brief glance, words might have us believe. A letter, a brief message, a hurried call can inﬂame desire, a story might have it. Hearts are warmed by attention from the one we care for, we might think. This is all very well in language, but surely, a picture of an actual person in ﬂames is something to be rejected outright. Certainly, greeting card racks do not show the object of affection holding out smoking brands or putting burning coals to the adoring one’s chest. Language inside the card may allow what a concrete image on the front would not, being just too dismaying. Hence, the pictures on the fronts show aer- obatic cherubs, ﬂoating symbolic hearts, and skeins of ﬂowers, not ﬂames. The hot words giveth, but the pictures avoid. One moral is that thought does not use the images that would most directly illustrate the thought. Often, additional physical details are extra- neous, gauche, and distracting: a faux pas. The moral is also plain in theological illus- trations. Egyptians believed our heart was weighed in the afterlife, to judge our char- acter. A picture of this as bleeding muscles on a scale, veins and arteries dangling, is an off-putting version of this attractive conceit. Some celebrate the idea that God is three in one. But most images of this God show three entirely distinct entities, not a hydra-headed body. Indeed, God the Spirit is shown as a dove, not a person, despite rumors about God being in three persons. Perception disal- lows what cognition names in this instance. A sack with three heads is a sad version of what is a light and charming paradox in lan- guage. What is metaphoric in religious concepts is not clear to many scholars who care about such things and may not cross the mind of congregants. It may be that depicting a vivid concept can help distinguish the message from the treatment. A drawing to show “God is your father,” taken literally, would be as plainly odd as the three-in- one sack, one to be treated scurvily even by saintly folk. Failings in transfer go from images to words too. We will make little headway referring to a jerky wheel as one with bent spokes, a wobbly wheel as oval-shaped, and a spinning wheel as one with curved spokes. Language speciﬁes the motion and does not need the circumlocution to nonsalient fea- tures (Giora, 2003).\n456 JOHN M. KENNEDY More upbeat for the case for metaphoric pictures is the evident success of some gen- res. Metaphoric badges and coats of arms are old-fashioned. But schematic logos are accepted without question, and their designs carry implications: CN railways has a contin- uous line making the C and N. In the 19th century, stained-glass win- dows offered emblems and portrayals of stock characters. Justice with a balance, Wis- dom with a book, Art with an easel, and Democracy with a speech were presented as women in Greek robes carrying objects indi- cating their role. (Alas no caryatid for Doubt, Argue, Test, and Prove!) Public buildings are now rather spare. Any principle on view is via architecture, and implicit. Judicious shape, texture, mate- rial, lighting, and function take the place of solid maidens and explicit ideals. The result is considerable debate on the meaning of a building, if any. The affordances of a pub- lic space for assembly may be quite evi- dent or hidden. A V-shaped roof may be taken to indicate ﬂight, as if the V stood for wings. The ﬂight in turn can stand for ambi- tion, progress, or optimism. Linz Cathe- dral, Austria, has unique postwar stained- glass windows with the forms and colors of modern scientiﬁc and technical imagery. This act of imagination deserves applause. The metaphor may be “value accepts knowl- edge.” Westminster Abbey is ﬁlling its niches with celebrated ﬁgures such as Nelson Man- dela. They are not ciphers. They are known as expressive people because of close-up, informal news pictures in our living rooms. Perhaps as informality grew, formal imagery standing for values has shrunk. The absence of exhortation and state- ments of principle, the loss of formality and the absence of mottos, epigrams, and labels of Emblematica, means implicit messages from pictures in the media and styles of building may now be especially important. In practice, the result may be that skill in reading metaphors in public constructions may be taken for granted by some onlook- ers and may be something to which others are oblivious. As with public buildings, highly pub- lic pictures now often try to be suitably metaphoric. Advertisements do more than just show the latest style of shoe, for exam- ple they compress a forthcoming movie into a single image. Henri Cartier-Bresson made a career from photographing a moment that summarized a story – a man frozen at the instant he leaped a puddle in Paris, delighted to be alive, it seemed, in a great city emerging from a blanket of war, or an irrepressible urchin grinning as he carried home bread and wine in a family shop- ping basket. Great photographs offer sensu- ous pleasure and metaphoric claims about lifestyles. In this, they are reminiscent of emblems. Vicari (1993, p. 167) wrote that “emblems were believed to be good teach- ing devices, because they combined sensu- ous appeal with a precept in such a way as to make the precept more memorable. The initial puzzle posed by the motto and picture would arrest the mind, driving the mean- ing into memory.” Likewise, in an advertise- ment, a pretty model beside a car or the scene around it are thought to hold atten- tion while the character and personality the maker wants the car to seem to have is com- municated, reinforced by the person or land- scape in the picture. Cigarettes used to be shown being con- sumed by rugged cowpokes and radiant ath- letes. As if. . . . But what exactly did the ad specify? That cigarettes were medically ﬁne? A generous interpretation is that the actors were not harmed by the products and made only occasional, pleasurable use of them. But even in past days child actors were off limits. The idea that children would be deliberately targeted by a picture with a message that cigarettes are glamorous is clearly of legal interest. The intellectual stumbling block of the law is that there are no pat ways to estab- lish a picture conveys a given metaphoric message. That a few people get the mes- sage can be set against many others taking the image other ways. The upshot is that to err on the side of caution only metaphoric warning pictures are fully legal. Cigarettes can be shown as made of white skulls,\nMETAPHOR AND ART 457 implying “cigarettes kill,” or sadly limp to suggest they cause impotency. A weakness of emblems is they require explanation, for example, soccer follow- ers have scarves and baseball fans have caps. Communicative power today often lies in staying relatively close to the stan- dard meaning of objects while using them imaginatively. Arnheim (1974) said that a heap of objects is just that unless a theme unites them. An advertisement from Hol- land shows a low wall, constructed from ordinary crates of bottles of a famous beer, snaking across a Dutch ﬁeld, with the motto, “They have the Great Wall but we have our beer,” an advertisement that does not take itself too seriously (Forceville, 1996). The theme explains the crates unrealisti- cally receding into the distance across a farmer’s ﬁeld. In an amusing ad about ﬁt- ness, each slot in a parking lot has no car, just a pair of running shoes, offering a theme to do with active exercise versus sit-down commuting. Degrees of Realism as Apparent Naturalism If realistic features are what are violated in many metaphors, pictures need to appear more or less realistic. Apparent realism was a topic of concern a century after the discov- ery of perspective in the Renaissance. One response was that pictures would look more natural if they included incidentals. In the result, a precursor of 19th-century Natural- ism (a term invented by Emile Zola), the depicted setting for, say, a saint’s trial was deemed more realistic if it included acci- dental objects such as dogs snifﬁng around a corner, a restless baby off to one side, a servant busy about his business, a bluebottle on a sleeve. Similarly, movies are full of off- topic extras, little to do with the gist of the story. In Good Will Hunting (Van Sant, 1997), a barﬂy (Pat O’Donnell) opens a scene. (Pat says, “Bullshit! You never said that!”) The action then moves to the back of the bar, where Will’s psychologist has a conversation with his teacher. The barﬂy only helped set the scene. What Tropes These Pictures Be Besides failing as versions of particular say- ings, shortcomings of pictures may tell us a great deal more about art and metaphor than Emblematica simply falling out of fashion has done. Indeed, pictures may fail whole classes of metaphors. Only some tropes suit pictures (Kennedy, 1982). Let us consider several kinds, some succeeding, some not, and the principles that divide them. Hendiadys is one by means of two, as in “I want you to give a really big hand to a great member of Parliament and a wonderful fam- ily woman.” It could be two people, but it is just one. Esref’s drawing of a wheel in jerky motion uses hendiadys, showing the wheel twice. Euphemisms cover what it is rude to say bluntly as in “WC” for toilet and “passed-on” for dead. Fig leaves are painted in unrealistic places, and long hair tresses just happen to cover sex parts too, too conveniently. Hyperbole is exaggeration. Exaggerated features make faces more recognizable and more rapidly recognized (Rhodes, 1996). Synecdoche uses a part to represent the whole. “Sail hoy” means a ship is near, not just its sail. Walls are often sketched as top and bottom and a few representative bricks. A few cows drawn fairly fully and a few parts of the head and horns of the rest of the cattle can suggest a herd. Caricaturists sometimes draw a distinctive object carried by their subject – Churchill’s cigar, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s cigarette holder, Napoleon’s hand in his jacket. Wellington has no such legacy, not even his boots. Personiﬁcation attributes human charac- teristics to inanimate objects. Common in children’s books, it is not just child’s play. It can depict social conﬂicts, with unions and companies as characters. Poverty, sci- ence, and progress are personiﬁed at times. Someone can be presented as a personiﬁ- cation of evil, with the danger that they\n458 JOHN M. KENNEDY lose their humanity, their capacity for mis- steps and anguish. In their picture, they will appear as a cipher, dehumanized. The strange man with a hat, moustache, and gun is pictured expressionless. He is taken to be incapable of rational negotiation, his afﬁrmations and denials irrelevant. Con- versely, Harpur (2004) writes, great reli- gious ﬁgures many take to be real are often just personiﬁcations of character traits, desires, dealings with birth and death and social values, once portrayed as Amun Re or Zoroaster or Osiris. New personiﬁca- tions can be major contributions to civi- lization, such as the United States’s Santa Claus ﬁgure, and the refreshingly touch- ing Danish ﬁgure of Christ, which portrays a sweet man with his arms held low and open toward the viewer in a comforting gesture. Pictures spread personiﬁed images. With time, the image can take over, so white robes on a slim man with long hair, beard, clear smooth skin is a prototype prophet. Though God may be female, there are no widely accepted images of Her. Or of the God who plays dice. In the reverse of personiﬁcation, people are portrayed with characteristics of objects, arms as missiles, ﬁngers as barrels of guns, hair as ﬂowers, or arms as wings. Lopes (1996) writes, Picasso’s painting “Francoise Gilot, ‘Femme Fleur’” (1946) showed her as a ﬂower. There were more ﬂower proper- ties than Gilot on display. Lopes suggests the painting could be metaphorically true, and it may be Gilot had a ﬂowery disposition. In the Van Eyck brother’s altarpiece at St. Bavo’s in Ghent, the painting is of a lamb standing on an altar. In Lopes’s words, “the picture represents Christ, whose innocence is being compared to a lamb’s, yet none of the properties it ascribes to him is literally true” (1996, p. 96). Lopes’s phrasing suggests a simile “Christ is like a lamb.” In the Van Eyck, there is no overt contra- diction, and the picture works like a proverb. “Too many cooks spoil the broth” is meant to tell us about situations far removed from cooking. So too a metaphoric picture can operate by analogy (Gentner & Bowdle, 2001) its message directed very generally, not at the situations in the painted scene. Some tropes transfer not at all well to pictures. Meiosis (understatement) is a good case. Just as facial features can be exag- gerated, they can also be diminished. But recognition is impaired. No caricaturists work with meiosis as their dominant style (Rhodes, 1996). Irony in pictures is surely rare (a claim disputed by Giora, 2003, and this volume’s gentle editor, I should add, in a personal communication, November 2004). In irony, the opposite is offered, as in “nice catch,” after a fumble. Depicting a careful dresser as sloppy or the reverse is not going to improve recognition. Irony emphasizes the difference between two states of affairs, making plain which is true. In language, the irony is often accompanied by a special tone of voice, but alas no manner of portrayal has yet been invented that is the tip-off for pictorial irony. New Yorker cartoons are often ironic, but their irony lives in a caption’s ﬁt to the picture. In pictures, metaphor is not readily dis- tinguished from its sibling simile. A sim- ile is a comparison that can be turned into a metaphor without loss of logical status. A literal similarity such as “A Mercedes is like a Volvo” cannot be turned into “A Mer- cedes is a Volvo,” but a metaphor “life is a candle in the wind” can be expressed as a simile, “life is like a candle in the wind.” There is no equivalent in pictures for the presence and absence of “like.” Hence, this chapter could have been entitled “Simile in Pictures.” To show a Mercedes is literally like a Volvo, the two could be shown side by side. The features of one would not be added to the other. To show “this woman is rooted like a tree” one could well add roots to her image. “Metaphor in pictures” has only at best subtle advantages over “simile in pictures,” but metaphor is the common-talk term for trope and points straightforwardly to an object being treated as something else.\nMETAPHOR AND ART 459 “Metaphoric Picture” Is a Metaphor In large measure, tropes in language are not perfectly matched onto pictures because language and pictures are on a different foot- ing (Hopkins, 1998). Pictures use percep- tion, which is far from arbitrary. Hence, violations of perceptual principles are dis- tinctive with little or no prior experience with pictures. The contradictions call for an explanation. If a reason becomes clear, a metaphor may be in play. In contrast, words have arbitrary meanings. Winner means loser, if we wish, with the added factor that, likely, the normal meaning of winner was expected and desired by the protago- nist. The reversal game can be extended: I came home expecting to be surprised, but there was no surprise. Therefore, I was surprised. Perception responds to a contour’s value on a dimension such as curvature. At times, it achieves recognition by responding with respect to a mean, for example, a person’s nose is a tad longer than the average, hair curlier than the average, eyes more close set than the average. Showing the reverse of each of these does not trigger recogni- tion, since the recognition was not based on an arbitrary direction from a mean. Words are arbitrary, and reversing from taller to tiny is still arbitrary, so a big man may be freely nicknamed “Little John” and become the common reference term, all the while retaining its irony. In short, pictures use perception that is intuitive and untaught, and words are coinage whose denomination is anything we agree on. Perhaps we want the intu- itive format of picturing itself to be trans- gressed in a good metaphor, and simply adding objects (such as ﬁre in the breast of the would-be lover) seems too nonpic- torial a play. Likewise, metaphoric language that simply refers to how someone looks (“he went as red as a beetroot”), without manipulating aspects of language, may seem unsophisticated. We prefer “his embarrass- ment knew no bounds.” Similarly, slogans such as “revenge in the name of the Great Leader” seem apt to unwary minds, liter- ally astray precisely because the gloomy act has to do with the leader, not a purely lin- guistic device, a name. (Slogans ﬁnesse argu- ment. This one assumes greatness would want revenge.) Words have types, such as “names,” with no direct equivalent in pictures. Pictures do not have verbs or nouns. They do not have “to be.” They do not have sentence structure. Hence, they cannot make claims. They can- not say A is B or A is not B. Hence, they are only metaphors in a sense of metaphor that needs to be ﬁrmly hedged here. Further still, pictures do not have log- ical quantiﬁers. All, some, none, and deﬁ- nite and indeﬁnite articles are missing. They cannot distinguish “all the bunnies on Lan- caster lawns” from “some bunnies” or “the bunnies.” Hence, they do not offer prop- erties needed for concepts. The mansions in Lennoxvale are examples of the concept “houses.” There are more examples such as all the Queen’s mansions. All the examples have the proper features of the concept, and some have features of subcategories. The lawns around large Lennoxvale houses help them qualify for the subcategory of man- sions. But pictures cannot indicate that the bunnies and the mansions they show are all or some or none of the pertinent examples. Miss all and some and there is no con- ceptual hierarchy. Is this a dagger that I see before me? Or a knife? Or a weapon? Or an implement? Or a hand-held object? It is all of these and more. Pictures do not specify the level in a hierarchy at which particular examples should be taken. Pictures do not say false and “Therefore this dagger is in Sans Souci is false” is not picturable. The “therefore” is not picturable. A lack of verbs, sentence structure, and deﬁning properties of concepts and arguments means pictures can stimulate thought, but they are not capable of being the actual engines of thought. Imageless thought is what is vital for arriving at con- clusions. There is no concrete experience of any image or object whatsoever that speciﬁes any of the necessities of a logical operation.\n460 JOHN M. KENNEDY Finally, metaphors in language work by ﬁnding common features, but superﬁcially, they have the form of a claim about a category, as “crime is a disease” mimics “Volvos are cars.” Pictures lack the superﬁ- cial form to be metaphors. The prosecution rests. The claim that pic- tures are metaphoric is metaphoric, it seems, having only a metaphoric truth. A Metaphoric Picture Is a Successful Metaphor Perhaps pictures can be parts of claims, ellip- tical metaphors. They have subjects and treatments and can be understood to have topics and comments. Further, pictures are not self-employed. They are from a person with an intention. Hence, the idea that they are part of a highly successful medium for messages is justiﬁed (Gibbs & Gerrig, 1989). In context, “No, I do not want sugar” may be a legitimate expansion of “No!” So too a picture can be taken to be part of a sentence and a metaphoric sentence to boot. The pic- ture supplies items which can be expanded into a sentence. Picasso’s powerful Guernica supplies objects of wartime, defenseless peo- ple, an eye in the sky, and more. Many things make it metaphoric, including the eye in the sky. The possible expansion would use all of these objects and possibly more. The form of the sentence could well be “the wartime tragedy is a. . . .” Agreed, the sentence is not in the picture. But the picture is part of a communication, though the structure “the . . . is a . . .” is implicit. An implicit structure and a picture com- bined can be metaphoric or literal. If the reader found the examples in this chapter easy to understand, the discussion of partic- ular pictures such as Eady’s “Lost” and spin- ning wheels easy to follow and the claims about emblems defensible, then pictures can be metaphoric. The reason could well be that “the . . . is a . . .” is understood. Metaphors simply indicate some features of a topic. “Gandhi was a dove” tells us his peaceful tactics are to be entertained. Similarly, pictures have features that are relevant to the message. The devices pre- senting the features can violate their own literal, standard use, a regular practice in tropes. As with metaphors in pictures, so with metaphors in language. In both, context combines with the representation to decide whether a metaphor is at work. “Ray is a star” is a metaphor in a context where Ray is a person and a star a point of light. “Your head is cut” only means you are silly in Ulster contexts. That pictures can be metaphoric is true, and metaphoric. The defense rests, having fully agreed with the prosecution but added to it. Metaphor abounds in art. References Arnheim, R. (1974).

Introduction Lakoff and Johnson’s characterization of metaphor as “understanding and experi- encing one kind of things in terms of another” (1980: 5) strikes a felicitous bal- ance between precision and vagueness. For one thing, it captures Black’s (1979) basic idea that a metaphor triggers an interac- tion between phenomena from two differ- ent domains, construable as a target and a source domain, in which features and/or structural relationships of the source are mapped onto the target. This mapping then leads to a transformation of that target. Moreover, Lakoff and Johnson’s descrip- tion emphasizes the dynamic nature of the trope both in the sense that a metaphor requires active uptake by its audience and in the sense that metaphors potentially inﬂu- ence people’s perspectives on the world, and the actions they may undertake as a consequence of adopting these perspec- tives. A third attractive aspect of the for- mulation is that it does not specify the sign system in which the metaphorical coupling is to be achieved. The authors, of course, deliberately avoid a restriction to the verbal because a crucial tenet of Metaphors We Live By is that metaphors are “primarily a matter of thought and action and only derivatively a matter of language” (1980: 5). Lakoff and Johnson are right that the occurrence of metaphors is not restricted to language. Consider the following ﬁlm sequences: in a famous scene in The Gold Rush (Chaplin, USA 1925) a hungry Charlie Chaplin eats his shoe laces in a manner sug- gesting that SHOE LACES ARE SPAGHETTI; the Ellen Burstyn character in Requiem for a Dream (Aronofsky, USA 2000), stoned on diet pills, sees the fridge containing all the food she cannot eat as a monster (FRIDGE IS MONSTER); and to a 17th-century priest intent on converting the Indians (Black Robe, Beresford, Canada/Australia, 1991), the trees in the jungle appear as church pillars (JUN- GLE IS CHURCH, see Forceville, 2005a). In none of these scenes, language is neces- sary for the construal and interpretation of what, in the spirit of Black’s interaction the- ory of creative metaphors, must be called metaphors. 462\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 463 More structurally embedded metaphors, too, can occur in ﬁlm. Here is a ﬁlm scene in Mary Poppins (Stevenson, USA 1964): Mary, Bert, and the children visit uncle Albert, who whenever he is happy and has fun literally rises to the ceiling and only by think- ing of sad things can get himself back on the ground again. The scene exempliﬁes HAPPY IS UP, evoking connotations that a verbal equivalent (e.g., “Uncle Bert’s spirits rose,” see Lakoff & Johnson, 1980: 15) do not – say, of emphatic humor, and of the inevitability and contagiousness of the effect of laughing (the children join Uncle Albert in his laugh- ing bout and can’t help but being lifted to the ceiling, too). Clearly, if metaphors are essential to thinking (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999, 2003), it makes sense that they should occur not only in language but also in static and moving pictures, sounds, music, gestures, even in touch and smell – and in their var- ious permutations. It is a shortcoming of conceptual metaphor theory (CMT), how- ever, that it has hitherto largely ignored non- verbal metaphors such as those just men- tioned. Studying them is necessary to test and reﬁne CMT, which is currently ham- pered by the fact that most of the evidence adduced to prove the existence of concep- tual metaphors comes from language alone. If the study of metaphor (along with other organizing principles, such as propositional structure, image schemas, and metonymic mapping; Lakoff, 1987: 68) is a key strat- egy for the delineation of cognitive models (e.g., K¨ovecses, 2000: 115; Lakoff, 1987: chap. 4), then all possible manifestations of the trope must be studied to avoid the risk that important aspects of its nature are misun- derstood because of the concentration on a single mode of expression (Gibbs & Colston, 1995: 354). McLuhan’s old adage that the medium is the message holds for metaphor- ical messages no less than for any other kind. In this chapter, I will outline the moder- ately well understood phenomenon of picto- rial metaphor and demonstrate the validity of the hitherto untheorized concept “mul- timodal metaphor.” As a ﬁrst approxima- tion, I will deﬁne multimodal metaphors as metaphors in which target, source, and/or mappable features are represented or sug- gested by at least two different sign systems (one of which may be language) or modes of perception. Multimodal metaphors can be delineated best by ﬁrst describing pictorial metaphors, the type of nonverbal metaphor that has attracted most scholarly attention. How exactly the construal and impact of pictorial and multimodal metaphors differ from their verbal counterparts is largely unexplored territory, but the following fac- tors seem to play a role. First, the pic- torial or multimodal nature of target and source means that they are apprehended differently from their verbal counterparts: pictures, sounds, and gestures have a percep- tual immediacy that is lacking in language. One dimension of this perceptual imme- diacy is a high degree of speciﬁcity. Uncle Bert’s happiness is not just upward-directed, it is upward-directed in precisely the way depicted in the aforementioned scene, with a certain speed of ascension, a certain insta- bility once the characters are up, and so on. Second, pictorial and multimodal represen- tations have different, medium-determined ways of cueing the similarity between tar- get and source than language has. Third, inasmuch as sounds and pictures are more easily recognized transnationally than (unfa- miliar) languages, pictorial and multimodal metaphors allow for greater cross-cultural access than verbal ones. Fourth, pictorial and multimodal source domains probably have a stronger emotional appeal than verbal ones. The structure of this chapter is as fol- lows. After examining pictorial metaphors in section 2, I analyze in section 3 a num- ber of multimodal metaphors in order to investigate their various dimensions and, where appropriate, suggest possible impli- cations for metaphor theory. The instances presented are all creative, ad hoc speci- mens of multimodal metaphor. In section 4, I shift to multimodal metaphors of the embedded kind theorized by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and propose how studying multimodal metaphor can be fruitful for research outside of metaphor scholarship.\n464 CHARLES FORCEVILLE Section 5 contains recommendations for fur- ther research. 2. Pictorial Metaphor Pictorial metaphor (or visual metaphor) is the most examined nonverbal mode of metaphor (Carroll, 1994, 1996; Cupchik, 2003; Danto, 1993; Dent-Read & Szokol- sky, 1993; Forceville, 1988, 1994, 1996, 2000a, 2002; Forceville & Urios-Aparisi, in preparation; Kaplan, 1990, 1992; Kennedy, 1982, 1993; Kennedy & Kennedy, 1993; Maalej, 2001; Moulin, 2002; Rohdin, 2003; Rozik, 1994, 1998; Schuurman, 2003; Simons, 1995; Whittock, 1990), although as yet no uniﬁed theory exists. Pictorial metaphors are monomodal: their target and source are entirely rendered in visual terms, just as their verbal sisters have a target and source entirely rendered in language. For anything to be a metaphor, pictorial or otherwise, the following three questions should be capable of being answered: (1) What are its two domains? (2) What is its target domain, and what its source domain? (3) Which feature or (structured) cluster of features can or must be mapped from source to target? (Forceville, 1996: 108, adapted from Black’s 1979 interaction theory). In verbal metaphors, answering the ﬁrst two questions is often considerably facilitated by language’s combination of linearity and syntactical rules, which help distinguish between grammatical subjects (“A”) and metaphorical predicates (“is B”). This makes it easy to assess the metaphoricity of, and difference between, say, the evergreens “butchers are surgeons” and “surgeons are butchers” (see Forceville, 1995). In pictures, however, particularly static ones, there is no such linearity, nor grammatical “rules” for disambiguating target and source, so that tar- get and source must be identiﬁed as such on other grounds. A second issue that makes pictorial metaphors different from verbal ones is the labeling of target and source. As Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) analyses demonstrate, ver- bal metaphors of various syntactic forms are manifestations of a conceptual metaphor that can be captured in a paradigmatic A IS B format. But in pictorial metaphors, even if it is clear what entities in an image are to be understood as the target and the source of the metaphor, making it experience- able, these entities need to be “translated” into the conceptual (but still verbalized!) A IS B format for them to be academically discussable. In fact, this issue is more prob- lematic even in language than Lakoff and Johnson have made it out to be (but cf. Johnson, 2007: 267, passim); for instance, is the verbal metaphor “He attacked every weak point in my argument” a manifestation of ARGUMENT IS WAR (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980: 4) or rather of ARGUMENT IS BATTLE, ARGUMENT IS STRUGGLE, or perhaps DIS- CUSSION IS STRUGGLE? Each verbalization entails a different emphasis (Lakoff & John- son, 1980, pay some attention to this issue on pp. 83–86; see also Lakoff & Johnson, 2003: 264–265). But however this may be, the reports of the “translations” from the ver- bal to the conceptual and vice versa at least remain within the sign system of language. In order to discuss a certain phenomenon as a specimen of nonverbal metaphor, by con- trast, one must perform the mental gym- nastics of representing in language that a CONCEPTUAL METAPHOR has a nonlinguistic manifestation, while the choice of label co- determines possible interpretations of the metaphor. Four types of pictorial metaphor were dis- tinguished in Forceville (1996), one of which (“verbo-pictorial metaphor”), in retrospect, is in fact a subtype of multimodal metaphor. The labels for the types were subsequently (Forceville 2002a) adapted as follows: Contextual Metaphor An object is metaphorized because of the visual context in which it is placed. An example is a Dove hair-silk ad from Holland, with the slogan, “Your hair, too, sometimes deserves a treat” (Figure 26.1; translations here and throughout are mine), resulting in the metaphor: HAIR-SILK IS ICECREAM. The spoon in the hair-silk ad is, in this example,\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 465 Figure 26.1. Dutch advertisement for Dove hair-silk, with the contextual pictorial metaphor HAIR SILK IS ICECREAM. the most important contextual element that cues the source domain “ice cream” (or a similarly creamy luxury food). The mapped feature is the notion of spoiling oneself with luxury food. Hybrid Metaphor Two objects that are normally distinct enti- ties are physically merged into a single “gestalt.” An example is an advertisement for the Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn, which shows the metaphor CLOGS ARE RUNNING SHOES, with the headline “There’s a reason why our spinach is deep-frozen so fast,” the body copy specifying that quick deep-freezing best preserves the vitamins (Figure 26.2). The clogs metonymically refer to the farmer who harvests the spinach; the running shoes refer metonymically to a sprinting athlete, and thus cue the mappable feature of “speed.” Hybrid metaphor, here regarded as a subtype of pictorial metaphor, appears to be identical with what Carroll considers pictorial (or visual) metaphor par excellence, arguing that it is characterized by both “homospatiality” and “noncompossibil- ity” (1996: 213): Two phenomena are visu- ally represented as occupying the same space in a manner that is physically impossible\n466 CHARLES FORCEVILLE Figure 26.2. Dutch advertisement for the supermarket chain Albert Heijn, with the hybrid metaphor CLOGS ARE RUNNING SHOES. (see Forceville, 2002b, for a critical discus- sion of Carroll’s ideas). Pictorial Simile Two objects are represented in their entirety in such a way that they are made to look similar. The techniques available to cue this similarity are manifold: similarity in form, position, color, lighting, function, and so on. An example is an advertisement for Nokia mobile phones, featuring a matchstick and a phone against a white background. In between the two pictures there is the text “simply ingenious” (Figure 26.3). The resulting metaphor can be verbalized as MOBILE PHONE IS MATCHSTICK. The fea- tures mapped from matchstick to phone are, presumably, the proverbial brilliance asso- ciated with its invention and its small size. The body copy conﬁrms this interpretation. While MOBILE PHONE IS MATCHSTICK can be categorized as a monomodal metaphor of the pictorial kind, NOKIA MOBILE PHONE IS MATCHSTICK would strictly speaking be a multimodal metaphor, because the brand name is rendered verbally. Similar reasoning holds for Figure 26.1: the brand name (“Dove”) is speciﬁed verbally while the source domain is anchored by the headline (particularly the word “treat”) and words in the body copy (e.g., “spoil yourself”). Since\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 467 Figure 26.3. Advertisement for Nokia mobile phones, with the pictorial simile MOBILE PHONE IS (LIKE) MATCHSTICK. pictorial metaphors in advertisements often have the advertised product (identiﬁed by brand name or logo, the latter having a status somewhere in between picture and text; see Koller, in preparation) as their target, they often verge toward the multimodal type (for more on the distinction between types of pictorial metaphors and more examples, see Forceville, 1996, http://www.chass.uto- ronto.ca/epc/srb/cyber/cforcevilleout.html). In addition to the types identiﬁed in my earlier publications, I now propose to\n468 CHARLES FORCEVILLE Figure 26.4. Philips’ Senseo coffee machine, with the integrated metaphor COFFEE MACHINE IS SERVANT. distinguish another subtype of pictorial metaphor, integrated metaphor, investigated by Van Rompay (2005): A phenomenon experienced as a uniﬁed object or gestalt is represented in its entirety in such a manner that it resembles another object or gestalt even without contextual cues. Philips’ Senseo coffee machine suggests, through the curved shape of the reservoir and a plateau on which the cups must be placed, a servant or butler courteously serving coffee (Figure 26.4; I owe the example to Paul Hekkert; see Forceville et al., 2006a). The types identiﬁed can occur in mov- ing images as well as in static ones. Moving images, however, allow considerably more ways to construe metaphors than static pic- tures (Forceville 1999, 2002b, 2003, 2005a, 2007a, 2007b). Thanks to the dynamics of the camera, the similarity between target and source need not depend on before- camera resemblance but can also be created via identical camera movements, angles, or frame sizes. Moreover, since moving images unfold in time, a target and source need not, as in static images, be represented or suggested simultaneously: A target and a source may be represented seconds, minutes, or hours apart. Finally, a target or source domain can also be cued musically, or via a sound effect, thereby turning the metaphor into a multimodal one (for more discus- sion on the difference between monomodal and multimodal metaphor, see Forceville 2006a). Whittock (1990), also drawing on Black’s interaction theory, distinguishes 10 types of cinematic metaphor discussed under such labels as “Explicit comparison (epiphor): A is like B”; “Identity asserted: A is B”; “Iden- tity implied by substitution: A replaced by B”; “Juxtaposition (diaphor): A/B.” Many of his examples are accompanied by incisive analyses, but from a theoretical viewpoint it is problematic that the types are insufﬁ- ciently delimitated, as Whittock acknowl- edges (1990: 68), and that, in some cases, it makes more sense to label the phe- nomenon under discussion differently (e.g., as a metonym). Similar problems arise in Kennedy (1982; this volume) and Durand (1987). Kennedy deserves credit for alert- ing metaphor scholars to the possibility of nonliteral visualization and for his rich array of examples, but his analyses suffer from imprecision because he treats “metaphor” as an all-encompassing label synonymous with “trope.” The somewhat eclectic list of pictorial specimens in Kennedy (1982), including “allegory,” “anti-climax,” “hendi- adys,” and “prolepsis,” strongly suggests that pictures can have nonliteral meanings but precludes uniform analysis. Durand, adopt- ing a structuralist framework, places some 30 verbal tropes (only partly overlapping with Kennedy’s) in an intricate grid, sup- posedly governed by the axes of “opera- tion” and “relation,” each with various sub- types. Subsequently, he comes up with visual counterparts of these tropes, often supplying no more than a single exam- ple for each. Hardly any criteria are given to help distinguish between the tropes (see Forceville, 1996: chap. 3, for more discussion). However, I do support Carroll, Whittock, and Kennedy’s emphasis on metaphor producers’ intentions. Usually when we interpret something as a metaphor, this something was probably meant to be con- strued as a metaphor – after all, the ascrip- tion of intentionality to our fellow humans’ communicative acts crucially governs\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 469 human interaction (e.g., Gibbs, 1999a; Ponech, 1999; Sperber & Wilson, 1995; Tomasello, 1999). I therefore propose to consider intentional metaphors as the default, but not rule out in principle metaphorical analyses of phenomena which their producers did not envisage as metaphors. A distinction can be postulated between explicitly signaled metaphors (“marked metaphors”; Whittock, 1990: 50) and implicitly signaled metaphors (Forceville, 1999: 191–194). These latter pertain to phenomena that can, but need not, be construed as a metaphor to make sense. Such freedom is mostly restricted to metaphors of the pictorial simile variety, where the context may, or may not, make the metaphor salient. For instance, if in a picture close-ups of an open-mouthed busi- nessman and an open-mouthed shark are juxtaposed to warn against businesspeople’s unreliability (Teng & Sun, 2002: 302), the simile BUSINESSMAN IS LIKE SHARK is far more strongly suggested than if the same businessman were standing on a beach, shark ﬁns visible in the sea behind him. Sharks’ presence in a sea, after all, can be explained very well on nonmetaphorical grounds. Whether viewers will construe a metaphor in the latter case depends on their alertness, awareness of themes in a represen- tation as a whole, extra-textual knowledge, personal experiences, and beliefs. This leads to a stronger claim: In artis- tic contexts, a metaphor is sometimes con- struable even though it was not consciously intended as such by its maker. For instance, a representation may be accessed in a differ- ent cultural context, where a source domain has mappable connotations not present in the cultural context in which the metaphor was produced (e.g., a dragon, which in western mythology is a scary creature and in Chinese mythology a lucky one). Or a source domain (O. J. Simpson, the Twin Towers, the Dutch enfant terrible ﬁlmmaker Theo van Gogh, unexpectedly murdered by an Islamic fundamentalist) may have acquired associations over time that were not pertinent at the time of the metaphor’s production. Or a viewer has highly idiosyn- cratic experiences with a phenomenon such that a particular juxtaposition with another phenomenon makes her construe a metaphor not available to anybody else (the smell of the soap at granny’s place, the ﬂowers in her wedding bouquet, the favorite symphony of her ex-husband). In short, the construal and interpretation of such implicitly signaled metaphors depend on the interpreter, while the responsibil- ity for the derivation of explicitly signaled metaphors is the responsibility of the maker (this is commensurate with the relevance- theoretic distinction between strong and weak communication, Sperber & Wilson, 1995: 59 passim). 3. Multimodal Metaphor Multimodality is a complex concept, a mature theory of which needs to take into account sign systems, sensory perception, and the material carriers bridging the two. The material carriers, moreover, involve dimensions of institutional power (Holly- wood ﬁlm, the publishing industry, the advertising business). A full discussion of the interrelationships between all these is far beyond the scope of this chapter. For present purposes, the following will sufﬁce. For a combination of two phenomena to be construable as a multimodal metaphor, three criteria must be met, only the last of which exclusively characterizes the multi- modal variety. 1. Given the context in which they occur, the two phenomena belong to different categories. 2. The two phenomena can be slotted as target and source, respectively, and cap- tured in an A IS B format that forces or invites an addressee to map one or more features, connotations, or affor- dances (Gibson, 1979: chap. 8) from source to target. 3. The two phenomena are cued in more than one sign system, sensory mode, or both.\n470 CHARLES FORCEVILLE Figure 26.5. Dutch advertisement for TV channel Avante with the multimodal metaphor REMOTE CONTROL PAD IS SWISS ARMY KNIFE. If the producer wants her metaphor rec- ognized as such, she will help her audience by providing salient clues. The nature of these clues depends on the sign system(s) available to the sort of representation in which the metaphor is conveyed and/or the sensory organs necessary to access the repre- sentation. Simultaneity in the presentation of two domains (a picture and a sound, a sound and a smell, a picture and a taste, an inscription and the materiality of the car- rier) can play a role, as can similarity in shape or style (a picture of an object and the font of a word; the rhythm in a sequence of shots and the rhythm in a sequence of sounds; the unpleasantness that connects a sound to a smell) or salient positioning (mir- roring two objects along an axis; placing an object on the exact spot where another object is expected or where, in a ﬁlm, that object was earlier positioned) – and any combination of these and, no doubt, other techniques. A number of multimodal metaphors will now be discussed, chosen both for their hoped-for convincingness and to illustrate issues that surface once one ventures into the complex ﬁeld of multimodality. In the Dutch science magazine for youngsters Kijk (February 2000, an advertisement for the niche TV channel Avante (Figure 26.5) fea- tures a hybrid object that is simultaneously\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 471 a Swiss army knife and a remote control pad with the Avante logo. The accompanying text translates as “Avante. A TV channel to explore. Space travel · espionage · discover- ies · science · military forces · submarines · motors · aerospace · expeditions · cars · boats · inventions.” The line under the brand name reads “Call your cable provider for more information.” In this ad for a TV channel, the metaphor is REMOTE CONTROL PAD IS SWISS ARMY KNIFE. Whereas the tar- get and source are predominantly rendered pictorially, the numbers, symbols, and let- ters (“progr”) help identify the remote con- trol pad part of the metaphor, which quali- ﬁes the metaphor as multimodal rather than purely pictorial. What is mapped from the source to the target is presumably the knife’s proverbial array of functions and its status as a typical “boy’s toy” – and hence the source is likely to appeal to the dominant read- ership of the magazine, youngsters (mainly boys) with an interest in exploring the world. Note that the target is not itself a repre- sentation of the product, a cable provider, but metonymically refers to it, the Avante logo forging the crucial link. The similar- ity between target and source is suggested by the formal resemblance between a Swiss army knife and a remote control pad, and by the fact that they have been “merged” into a single gestalt. The similarity is created (see Black, 1979: 36ff.); outside of the present context we would probably fail to see spon- taneously any similarity between a remote control pad and a Swiss army knife. An ingenious specimen of multimodal metaphor occurs in La Strada (Fellini, Italy 1954). Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), the innocent and simpleminded heroine of the movie, is watching a religious procession in honor of the Virgin Mary. Given the narra- tive context of the ﬁlm as a whole, and the cut from Gelsomina to an image of the Vir- gin Mary carried in the procession, it is pos- sible to construe the metaphor GELSOMINA IS VIRGIN MARY. That Fellini wants us to construe this metaphor is suggested by another cue. While Gelsomina is watching, the camera movement quasi-accidentally makes visible behind her a poster on a wall with the text “Madonna Immacolata” (“Virgin Mother”). This metaphorical con- strual is not necessary however: Since Gelsomina is, in the story world, admiring a procession in a manner that does not in any sense strike us as impossible or improbable, and since there is no reason why she should not happen to be standing in front of a poster with the text “Madonna Immacolata,” we do not need to construe a metaphor here. This example teaches us several things. First, if a source domain emanates from the diege- sis itself (i.e., the story world as presented at that very moment), the source domain’s presence is realistically motivated and hence allows for the construal of a nonmetaphori- cal meaning. Second, a viewer can miss one of the two cueings of the source domain (the visual cut from Gelsomina to Virgin Mary and the text on the poster) and still construe the metaphor, although an aware- ness of both will strengthen the idea that Fellini intended the metaphor to be rec- ognized as such. Third, Fellini conveys the metaphor fairly subtly; he could have been more explicit, for instance, by cutting from close-ups of Gelsomina to the Virgin Mary image and the poster, respectively (and, for good measure, cut back once more to a close- up of Gelsomina, or reinforce the similarity by a musical theme or sound effect). Here is another example of a relatively weakly signaled cinematic metaphor. In a memorable scene from American Psycho (Harron, USA 2000), the title’s serial killer Patrick Bateman and some of his colleagues are outbidding each other with the stylish- ness of their business cards. The men carry their cards in a cardholder, which they ﬂick open (this happens twice in close-up), a clicking sound being audible on the sound- track. When they hand over a card for inspection, the tense silence is only broken by a faint “swooshing” sound, underlining the gesture. One man presents his card with outstretched arm to a colleague, as if threat- ening him. The scene ends when Patrick, already defeated by the other man’s more impressive card, requests to see “Paul Allen’s card.” When it is given to him, his eyes glaze over, and it drops from his hand on the table.\n472 CHARLES FORCEVILLE A colleague asks him, “Something wrong? Patrick? You’re sweating!” There is a strong suggestion that the metaphor BUSINESS- CARD IS KNIFE is to be construed. Not only the mise-en-sc`ene elements (the sudden drawing of the card, the outstretched arm, the blinking, open-switching of a metallic object, the sweating, the glazing over of the eyes) cue the metaphor; it is also the brevity of the shot of the cardholders that reminds the experienced action ﬁlm viewer of the way a suddenly drawn knife is represented. Note, incidentally, that even though it is the cardholder which is silver, blinks, and ﬂicks open, this does not mean that, all of a sudden, the metaphor shifts from CARD IS KNIFE to CARDHOLDER IS KNIFE: We assume that due to the metonymic link between card and cardholder we can construe CARD IS KNIFE. While it might be argued that this is a pictorial metaphor of the contex- tual type, the soundtrack aids the con- strual of the metaphor. The emphatic click of the opening of the cardholder, the brief silence and the “swooshing” sound effect all contribute to the kind of ten- sion that is familiar from imminent knife ﬁghts in numerous action ﬁlms. The word “knife” itself is used nowhere: The con- cept must hence be inferred from the visual clues (mise-en-sc`ene; camera angle, size, and movement; montage) and the sounds. While the metaphor can be verbalized as CARD(HOLDER) IS KNIFE, perhaps a bet- ter verbalization is EXCHANGING BUSINESS- CARDS IS A KNIFING DUEL. This verbal- ization does more justice to the important notion that metaphors are used to repre- sent the target domain in a way that sug- gests (potential) behavior, whether mental or real. That is, it is the affordances attached to the source domain that are mapped to the target – and this is something that the static A IS B format in which a concep- tual metaphor is conventionally represented fails to emphasize, as Lakoff and Johnson appear to be aware themselves (1980: 20; for the dangers of the NOUN A IS NOUN B formulation, see also Freriks, 2004). A ﬁnal point: Construing the metaphor as sketched here does not preclude construing other metaphors instead, or simultaneously. The boyish bragging scene discussed above, for instance, also allows for the metaphor COMPARING BUSINESSCARDS IS COM- PARING DICKS. The metaphors could be integrated in Fauconnier and Turner’s blending model, with “comparing cards,” “comparing dicks,” and “knife duel” as the three input spaces, and “male competitive behavior” as the central element in the generic space (see Fauconnier & Turner, 2002, especially the discussion of “The Bypass” on pp. 65–67). Another possible construal is COMPARING BUSINESSCARDS IS PLAYING POKER (personal communication, Antonio Barcelona and Rosario Caballero, Researching and Applying Metaphor confer- ence, University of Leeds, April 2006). A comparable, but more richly elaborated metaphor occurs in the ﬁlm The Showdown (Garlatti Costa, UK 2000), set in a gym. The humor of this three-minute gem, which con- tains no spoken language, depends on the exploitation of the metaphor BEHAVIOR IN A GYM IS A WESTERN DUEL. Two muscled men attempt to outperform one another in their workout routines in an atmosphere of intimidation, scaring others away from the climactic confrontation that looms ahead. The source is cued, of course, by the title of the ﬁlm. In addition, the soundtrack fea- tures hooves, nervous violins, triumphant trumpeting, a mouth organ, and ominous silence, while the images include extreme close-ups of eyes such as those in Once Upon a Time in the West (Leone, Italy/USA 1968), hands hovering at hip height about to rip away the genital-covering towel as if prepar- ing to draw a gun, and shampoo ﬂacons held as if they were guns. Even without the brief insert of a nondiegetic shot show- ing a colt being ﬁred, viewers would have deduced that the source domain is that of a Western (rather than a slamming, danc- ing, or dart-throwing) duel, and that the weapon is a gun (rather than a knife, as in the American Psycho scene). It would be reductive to say, drawing on the title, that we here have a manifestation of the verbo- pictorial subtype of multimodal metaphor\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 473 BEHAVIOR IN A GYM IS WESTERN DUEL. Neither is it a purely pictorial metaphor. While most viewers would probably be able to identify the metaphor if the sound were switched off, the richness of the map- pings would be diminished, since some of the mappable features in the source are enhanced by, or even given exclusively in terms of, the sound track. For another example, recall the scene of the ﬁrst killing in The Texas Chainsaw Mas- sacre (Hooper, USA 1974). Kirk has entered the house and sees a metal door in the dark corridor. We hear the sound of what seem to be nervously grunting pigs. Kirk walks toward the door, the ﬁlm’s killer, Leather- face, suddenly opens it and quickly butch- ers Kirk, the grunting sound remaining audi- ble. We could construe this sound as the source of the metaphor KIRK IS A PIG, a pig being a prototypically slaughterable ani- mal. It is not clear whether the grunting is a nondiegetic or a diegetic sound. Even though viewers do not see any pigs in the scene, they could well imagine that there are pigs on a Texan farm, and hence that there was a realistically motivated source for the sound. This “naturalizes” the metaphor, which means that the metaphor is prob- ably less salient (and hence more subtle) than when the source domain would have been cued by a transparently nondiegetic sound. Minutes later Kirk’s companion Pam is also caught by Leatherface. He carries her inside while she tramples and screams. If the audience construed, consciously or subconsciously, the metaphor KIRK IS A PIG, it may now interpret Pam’s tram- pling and screaming, similarly, as the kicking and squealing of a pig. Indeed, Leatherface proceeds by hanging Pam unceremoniously on a metal hook as if she were an ani- mal, thus reinforcing such a metaphorical construal. Two examples of a suggestive multimodal metaphor in which there is no diegetic “nat- uralization” of the sonically conveyed source domain occur in the documentary Gracious Curves (Luostarinen, Finland 1997; original title: Naisenkaari; thanks to Tarja Laine for drawing my attention to this ﬁlm), a poetic but disturbing meditation about the pres- sures on the female body caused by aging and operations, and about how society’s models of beauty impinge on women’s self- perception. In a brief scene, repeated once, we see the window of a weight scale from above. The pointer in the window goes to and fro before it settles on a number. At the same time, the sound of a spinning roulette ball is audible. A multimodal metaphor of the pictorial-sonic kind is presented here: WEIGHT-WATCHING IS PLAYING ROULETTE. The uncontrollability of the roulette ball’s trajectory and end-place could be mapped on the weight scale to suggest that weight- watching is a ﬁckle activity: Sometimes you lose weight, sometimes you gain. Alterna- tively, the pertinent mapping is that trying to lose weight is an exciting, risky, and/or frustrating gamble. A little later in the same ﬁlm, we see the feet of a young girl rope- skipping. Whenever the rope touches the ground we hear a whipping sound, suggest- ing the metaphor ROPE-SKIPPING IS WHIP- PING (ONESELF). Given the theme of the ﬁlm, we could map the notion of self- torture implied by whipping oneself onto the activity of rope-skipping, the latter activ- ity again performed because of weight-losing purposes. With the exception of the dueling metaphor in Showdown, the examples dis- cussed are multimodal metaphors with a local impact: The metaphors, while con- tributing to overall themes in the narra- tives in which they occur, do not permeate these narratives as such. But a multimodal metaphor can surface time and again and thereby become a structuring element in a narrative (Forceville, 1999). In this vein, stu- dents of mine have investigated metaphors such as MICKEY IS THE DEVIL (Natu- ral Born Killers, Stone, USA 1994), ET IS CHRIST (ET, Spielberg, USA 1982), and [FILM] FREEWAY IS [FAIRY TALE] LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD (Freeway, Bright, USA 1996). Such examples provide the transi- tion to metaphors that are no longer cre- ative in Black’s sense (see also Gineste, Indurkhya, & Scart, 2000; Indurkhya, 1991, 1992) but reveal metaphorical relationships\n474 CHARLES FORCEVILLE Figure 26.6. Still from animation ﬁlm O (Khurana, India 1994), with the multimodal metaphors LIFE IS A JOURNEY and KNOWLEDGE IS UP. deeply rooted in our cognitive mental models. 4. Embedded Multimodal Metaphor The examples discussed in sections 2 and 3 all had a target and source domain whose coupling is not conventional and hence are not amenable to such embedded metaphors as are the bread and butter of Metaphors We Live By. (I use the encompassing term “embedded” here to include Lakoff and Johnson’s structural, ontological, and ori- entational metaphors; see Lakoff & John- son, 2003: 264). But if Lakoff and John- son are correct in their claim that humans impose order on the world via the over- arching MIND IS BODY metaphor (1999: chap. 12), one would expect these embed- ded metaphors to be perceptible in pic- torial and multimodal representations no less than in verbal ones. Some work in this area has been embarked upon. Simons (1995) discusses a number of Dutch elec- tion broadcasts in terms of multimodal metaphors, such as ACHIEVING A GOAL IS GOING TO A DESTINATION and BUILD- ING A COALITION IS CROSSING A BRIDGE, exemplifying the “source-path-goal” schema as theorized by metaphor scholars (John- son, 1993: 166ff.; see also Turner, 1996: chap. 4). In a comparable vein, Forceville (2006b) explores how this schema informs the themes of the journey, the quest, and the story that are central to the ﬁrst person travel documentary. The four-and-a-half minute animation ﬁlm O (Khurana, India 1994) in a surprising and moving manner renders various embed- ded metaphors in largely nonverbal terms, corroborating conceptual metaphors identi- ﬁed in Lakoff and Johnson (1980). We see a baby growing into an old man, meeting many people, and adding all new insights and expe- riences garnered from these meetings in the form of pictograms into a balloon over his head (Figure 26.6). The shifting types of pic- tograms suggest his development, until the balloon becomes, literally, a weight under which he almost collapses (Figure 26.7). The ﬁlm not only visualizes LIFE IS A JOURNEY but also KNOWLEDGE IS UP, DEVELOPMENT IS UP, and EXPERIENCES ARE A BURDEN (for more discussion of this and other journeys in animated form, see Forceville and Jeulink 2007). Forceville (2005b) investigates how non- iconic signs in the Asterix comics album La Zizanie / TheRoman Agent (includingstraight and squiggly lines emanating from a charac- ter’s mouth, or surrounding its head, called\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 475 Figure 26.7. Still from animation ﬁlm O (Khurana, India 1994), with the multimodal metaphors DEVELOPMENT IS UP and EXPERIENCES ARE A BURDEN. “pictorial runes” by Kennedy, 1982) help des- ignate the emotion anger. This is done, the argument runs, in a manner commensurate with conceptual metaphors that K¨ovecses (1986, 2000, 2002) identiﬁes in language, such as ANGER IS A HOT FLUID IN A PRES- SURIZED CONTAINER. One of the conclu- sions is that the marked “eyes,” “mouth,” and “hand/arm” positions of the angry per- sons in the Asterix album exemplify comics- speciﬁc manifestations of the metaphor. Eerden (2004) extends Forceville’s investi- gations by analyzing another emotion the- orized by K¨ovecses, romantic love. His ﬁnd- ings demonstrate, among other things, that “eyes” and “hand/arm” positions are impor- tant elements in the depiction of enamored people, too, but that passionate love also has pictorial signals not shared with anger, for instance, a petriﬁed body posture and cer- tain symbols around the besotted person’s head. In addition, Eerden focuses on anger and love in yet another medium, anima- tion ﬁlm, showing that an angry character in Asterix animations is often represented by low-angle shots, as if “towering over” others, whereas an enamored person sometimes is represented in slow motion to indicate his mental state (Eerden, in preparation). Shi- nohara and Matsunaka (in preparation), in turn, show that while most of the runes iden- tiﬁed by Forceville also occur in Japanese manga, some runes appear to be culturally speciﬁc. This work by Forceville, Eerden, and Shinohara and Matsunaka points toward ﬁndings that have important implications for metaphor theory: While the pictorial mani- festations of the conceptual metaphors (e.g., ANGER IS HOT FLUID IN A PRESSURIZED CONTAINER, ANGER IS AN AGGRESSIVE ANIMAL, LOVE IS UNITY, LOVE IS PROX- IMITY, LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE) appear to be compatible with the verbal examples provided by K¨ovecses, the media of comics and animation have different ways of repre- senting these metaphors, and hence empha- size different aspects. Moreover, it tran- spires that the cultural variation in metaphor reported by K¨ovecses (2005) characterizes non-verbal varieties no less than verbal ones. Mainstream animation is a particularly suit- able type of representation for research- ing embedded metaphors of the multimodal type. Since, unlike in live-action ﬁlm, liter- ally everything visible and audible in ani- mation is artiﬁcially construed, this genre provides excellent opportunities for testing whether conceptual metaphors demonstrate their embodiment on the sound and picture level as well as on the level of language. Another medium that invites extensive investigations of its multimodal metaphors is\n476 CHARLES FORCEVILLE computer interfaces. The desktop metaphor, with its documents, folders, and wastebas- ket, structures our thinking and behavior concerning digital data, as does surﬁng, hack- ing, and ﬁrewalling. Internet itself is an environment that is largely given structure via metaphors. The Internet theorist Geert Lovink, for instance, reports how, in the early days of the medium, he co-founded an Internet environment on the basis of the multimodal metaphor INTERNET COM- MUNITY IS DIGITAL CITY (Lovink, 2002). Steven Johnson, calling infospace a “disor- dered universe made orderly again by the power of metaphor” (1997: 240), examines the implications of the metaphors propelling graphic interfaces inherent in links, win- dows, and agents. Multimodal metaphors can also occur in three dimensions. McNeill (1992: chap. 6 passim), Cienki (1998), and M¨uller (2004: chap. 3) address embedded metaphors in which the source is conveyed via a ges- ture. McNeill identiﬁes “metaphorics” as one of the major types of gestures and, among many other things, draws attention to the cultural speciﬁcity of metaphoric gestures (1992: 151). Cienki ﬁnds that the gestures of students discussing “honesty” reveal con- ceptual metaphors such as THE PAST IS BEHIND / THE FUTURE IS AHEAD, GOOD IS UP, and UNKNOWN IS UP. Moreover, his results are consonant with the impor- tant claim informing the present chapter that “gesture, and other non-verbal means of expression, can serve as independent sources of evidence of the psychological reality of conceptual metaphors” (Cienki, 1998: 190). M¨uller demonstrates in an illuminating case study that the allegedly “dead metaphor” SAD IS DOWN must be active in a cer- tain speaker’s mind, for the speaker accom- panies her tale of a sad incident with a downward hand movement (2004: 96). In a very different vein, Van Rompay et al. (2005) show that products and commodi- ties (a vase, a clock) can manifest embodied metaphors by expressing embodied schemas such as INSIDE / OUTSIDE, VERTICALITY, and BALANCE (Johnson, 1987; see also Van Rompay, 2005). 5. Avenues for Further Research Research into pictorial and multimodal metaphor is not only essential for a healthy metaphor theory, then, but can in turn help chart the ﬁeld that is variously called the “rhetoric of the image” (Barthes 1986), visual rhetoric, visual literacy, and multimodal dis- course (e.g., Kress & Van Leeuwen, 1996, 2001). It is illuminating, for instance, to study the kinds of metaphorical source domains that are typically used to promote products in advertising and whether these sources are presented verbally, visually, and/or – more subtly – sonically. It could turn out that the kinds of source domains metaphorically transforming the target domain COMPUTER in print advertisements are often shiny, metallic, toy-like objects, and hence appeal to male rather than female consumers, as I speculate in Forceville (2000). A genre whose examination may also beneﬁt from insights in metaphor theory is the political cartoon, which is full of pictorial and verbo- pictorial metaphors (see El Refaie, 2003, and several contributions in Forceville & Urios- Aparisi, in preparation). This genre con- trasts interestingly with advertising, since mappings from sources to targets (typically: politicians) are negative rather than posi- tive, as in advertising. To give another exam- ple of potential cross-fertilization: Rick Alt- man’s pioneering Film/Genre (1999) has a central thesis that is completely commen- surate with the prototype theory popu- larized by Lakoff (1987) and could have beneﬁted from systematically using it, while in turn the prototype theorists would do well to take into account Alt- man’s emphasis on the pragmatics of insti- tutional categorization. Theorists of the road movie genre (e.g., Cohan & Rae Hark, 1997) could proﬁt from metaphor scholars’ work on the source–path–goal schema. In addition, an awareness of the work- ing of multimodal metaphors can aid their potential deployment in the design and anal- ysis of all types of documents that persuade people to do, or refrain from doing, some- thing, ranging from instruction manuals (see\nMETAPHOR IN PICTURES AND MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS 477 Westendorp, 2002) and graphic design and mapmaking (see Engelhardt, 2002; Tversky, 2001) to advertising (see McQuarrie & Mick, 1999; McQuarrie & Phillips, 2007; Phillips, 2003). Further research into multimodal metaphor needs to branch out in various directions and should address, among others, the following questions: How do the various dimensions of a multimodal metaphor affect its potential uptake? As we have seen, multimodal metaphors can be distinguished according to, at least, the following dimensions: (1) which sign sys- tems and sensory modes are called upon to cue target and source domains; (2) whether the metaphor occurs in static or in mov- ing representations; (3) by what means the metaphoric similarity is cued; (4) how explicitly or implicitly a metaphor is cued by its producer; (5) whether a metaphor verges toward the creative or the embed- ded extreme of the continuum. All of these dimensions deserve further theoret- ical and empirical investigation. This is a huge task, if only because there are so many possible permutations of variables in a multimodal metaphor. Clearly, many more case studies of nonverbal and multimodal metaphor are necessary before generaliza- tions on any of these dimensions are fea- sible. For the time being, corpus studies of multimodal metaphors comparable to those Charteris-Black (2004) conducts for verbal metaphors are a long way off. But empirical research is greatly facilitated by the opportu- nities offered by digital treatment, allowing for the manipulation of variables in “real- life texts” (as opposed to invented exam- ples). In representations with a multimodal metaphor, one can, for instance, present con- ditions with and without music, written text, spoken text, and/or visual context, to test which effect, if any, these factors have on the speed of recognition of a metaphor or on the mappings selected from source to target. How are multimodal metaphors signiﬁcantly similar to, and different from, verbal metaphors? Given CMT’s claim that humans, to a con- siderable extent, think metaphorically, in- depth research is needed to ﬁnd out whether and how multimodal metaphors convey information or radiate emotion in possibly mode-speciﬁc manners not open to their verbal sisters. While we should beware of lumping all types of multimodal metaphors together (various subtypes may well turn out to be as different from one another as from verbal metaphors), for the time being, some hypotheses can be ventured: nonver- bal metaphors differ from verbal ones in (1) having a more sensual and emotive impact on viewers; (2) having greater inter- national appeal, since they do not (exclu- sively) rely on language codes; (3) allowing for subtler ways of being conveyed, hence achieving their rhetorical effects more unob- trusively. How do monomodal metaphors of the nonverbal varieties relate to verbal and multimodal metaphors? A complete and balanced theory of mul- timodal metaphor requires more detailed studies of monomodal metaphors of the nonverbal kind. Whereas the theorizing of the pictorial variety is now well under way, musical metaphors, that is, metaphors whose target and source domains are rendered in music, are only beginning to be discussed. Thorau (2003) argues that certain types of themes-and-variations in musical composi- tions should be understood as metaphors. It is illuminating, and consistent with my own ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of pictorial metaphor, that Thorau points out that while music shares enough similarities with language to warrant the claim that it can manifest metaphors in the ﬁrst place, the medium also displays idiosyncratic metaphorical behavior. For one thing, the source domain of what is to be construed as a metaphor may, unlike in a verbal A IS B format, become recognizable only gradually, because\n478 CHARLES FORCEVILLE variations on a theme (the target) develop in the course of the musical piece and may at ﬁrst not be recognizable as source domain. For another, the question of what is target and what is source in musical metaphors may be less easy to answer, and possibly even be irrelevant (for other studies on metaphor involving music and/or sound, see Cook, 1998: chap. 2; Forceville, 2004; Johnson & Larson, 2003; Victor, 2004, Zbikowski, in preparation). What other tropes besides metaphor have nonverbal and multimodal manifestations? It has been pointed out (Gibbs, 1993) that if we want to chart the cognitive models that govern human interactions with the world we should not only study metaphor but also investigate other tropes (Barcelona, 2000, has made a start on metonymy). This recommendation must be extended to multimodal representations. Such broad- ening moreover requires an awareness of which tropes can and which cannot be com- bined. Perhaps more importantly, theorists should be aware of the danger of routinely adapting a literary model that, while hav- ing the advantage of being elaborate and reﬁned, does not necessarily have counter- parts in the multimodal realm. (Kennedy, this volume, similarly argues against such a complete one-to-one correspondence.) In his study of animation, Wells (1998: chap. 3), for instance, tentatively distin- guishes (a suspiciously neat number of) 10 “narrative strategies” that overlap at least partly with what in linguistic–literary studies are called “tropes”: metamorpho- sis, condensation, synecdoche, symbolism and metaphor, fabrication, associative rela- tions, sound, acting and performance, chore- ography, and penetration. Bensdorp and Vergeer (2004), exploring the types of sound in animation ﬁlms, arrive at ﬁve tropes: metaphor, metonymy, composition, symbol- ism, hyperbole. Pursuing another line of thought, Teng and Sun (2002) not only elaborate on Forceville’s (1996) category of pictorial simile but also propose the new categories of “pictorial oxymoron” and “pictorial grouping.” Such endeavors sug- gest that both nonverbal monomodal (pic- torial, auditory, olfactory, tactile, gusta- tory) and multimodal representations have mode-speciﬁc tropes that cannot be pre- dicted or derived from a linguistic–literary model. What impact has the textual genre in which a pictorial metaphor occurs on its construal and interpretation? Genre considerations are central in the prag- matics of multimodal metaphor research. Whether something is a metaphor and, if it is, how it should be interpreted, partly depends on whether it occurs in, say, an advertisement, animation ﬁlm, instruction manual, video installation, or Web site. Indeed, it may matter whether a supposed multimodal metaphor surfaces in a main- stream Hollywood drama, a science ﬁction ﬁlm, or a European art movie. Finally, to what extent are multimodal metaphors subject to (sub)cultural variation? As in verbal metaphors (Emanatian, 1995; Gibbs, 1999b; Maalej, 2004; Yu, 1998), (sub)cultural connotations evoked by semantic domains may strongly affect the interpretation of a nonverbal or multimodal metaphor (Maalej, 2001; Shinohara & Mat- sunaka, 2003, in preparation; Shore, 1996; see also McQuarrie & Mick, 1999). Cultural factors, like generic ones, may determine both whether a metaphor can or should be construed in the ﬁrst place and, if so, what features are to be mapped from source to target.

We will begin to answer the question by considering a gesture that was famously set in stone. The image in Figure 27.1 is that of a statue of Vladimir Lenin, the Russian revolutionary that founded the Soviet Union. This particular statue stands in Vladivos- tok and similar statues were located in most major cities throughout the USSR and East- ern Europe in their communist era. On this statue, the right arm is extended, forward, and the hand is also extended pointing for- ward with the index ﬁnger. Other Lenin statues with the outstretched arm have the hand in a different orientation, some thumb up with a vertical palm, some palm down, and others palm facing up with an extended hand. The general image of the Lenin statue as pointing ahead was so prevalent that it became common for foreign tourists to have their picture taken below such stat- ues, mimicking the same forward-pointing gesture. One need only conduct an image search on the Internet for “lenin statue” to get a sense of the many occurrences of this representation of Lenin. But why is Lenin’s hand extended forward? While there are multiple interpretations, including the evocation of religious iconog- raphy (Bonnell, 1997: 144), a standard expla- nation is that Lenin was indicating the “bright future” of communism. As Bonnell (1997: 145) describes a painting of Lenin in the same position, “The position (arm and hand outstretched . . .) suggests forward movement – pointing in the direction of the future.” Thus the statue can be seen as frozen in the midst of producing a gesture that metaphorically indicates the future as located ahead. This is a metaphor common to many cultures, as explained below, and has been researched extensively as a con- ceptual metaphor dating back to Lakoff and Johnson (1980). In the Soviet state, it held special status in connection with the utopian vision of the future. Holz (1993: 74) notes that the Soviet government’s Five Year Plans “conceived of contemporary existence – the ‘is’ – as a permanent progress towards future socialist happiness – the ‘will be.’” For the 483\n484 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER Figure 27.1.

Source: Wikipedia.org. same reason, statues of Kim Il-Sung in a sim- ilar pose, pointing ahead, can be found in cities throughout North Korea. The gesture of pointing ahead to indi- cate the future is not unique to the gestures of human ﬁgures in stone; it also occurs in the spontaneous gesturing of living humans while speaking, the kind which will be focused on in this chapter. For example, Calbris (1990: 87) observes that in French and other European cultures, the future can be indicated by “a forward leap of the hand or foreﬁnger (Two-and-a-half million unem- ployed * very soon),” with the timing of the gesture indicated by the asterisk (*). Simi- larly, postponing an activity to a future time can be indicated gesturally by a movement forward of the hand or foreﬁnger: “We can’t put it off * until next week” (ibid.; and see Calbris, 1985, for more detail). Such use of gesture spontaneously in these contexts sug- gests that gesture is another form of human behavior in which we may see (in the mul- tiple senses of that word) the expression of metaphors. These few examples offer a glimpse of the relevance of studying gesture in rela- tion to thought, both individual thought and ideas shared by cultural groups. More speciﬁcally, they indicate the high rele- vance of gesture research for the study of metaphor in relation to thought. In this chapter, we argue that careful analyses of gestures provide support for the assumption that metaphor is a general cognitive princi- ple and that metaphoric mappings may be processed online. We will report on empiri- cal observations which document moreover that online metaphoric thought is highly cre- ative, ﬂexible, and culturally variable. In a nutshell, we will suggest that metaphoric- ity is inherently dynamic and – ultimately and unquestionably – a form of embodied cognition. At the end of this chapter, we will provide a more systematic outline of how the study\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 485 of gesture is relevant to this topic. But ﬁrst we need to clarify our understanding of what constitutes a metaphoric gesture, and how metaphoric gestures may relate to speech. What Is a Metaphoric Gesture? Metaphoric gestures have typically been conceived of as movements of the hands that represent or indicate the source domain of a metaphor (e.g., Bouvet, 2001; Calbris, 1990, 2003; Calbris & Porcher, 1989; Cienki, 1998, in press; McNeill, 1992; McNeill, Cassell, & Levy, 1993; McNeill & Levy, 1982; M¨uller, 1998b, 2004b in press a; N´u˜nez & Sweetser, 2001; Webb, 1997). The ﬁrst scholar to recognize that gestures may be used metaphor- ically was, however, the psychologist Wilhelm Wundt. He called gestures that transfer concepts from one domain to another “symbolic gestures,” and offered as an example the use of spatial gestures to represent temporal concepts (Wundt, 1922). “Yet the general character of the symbolic gesture consists in transferring the concepts to be expressed from one ﬁeld to another one, hence for example to indicate time concepts in terms of space, or to represent abstract concepts as perceptual ones.”1 Note that this is exactly what our introductory example illustrates: Pointing ahead in space used to indicate that an abstract object – here “the future” – is situated ahead in time. Space is used to represent time, and the pointing gesture which uses space to refer to time is considered a metaphoric gesture (cf. also Kita, 2003). This complements the extensive research on metaphors for time as space expressed in numerous languages of the world (e.g., Evans, 2004; Traugott, 1975). In many of these languages, though not in all, the future is talked about as being ahead (e.g., Fleischman, 1982, on Romance languages; Moore, 2000, on the Niger–Congo language Wolof; Shinohara, 1999, on Japanese; Yu, 1998, on Chinese). Scholars researching metaphoric gestures have often worked with a further speciﬁc ontological assumption, namely that the tar- get domain of gestural metaphors is an abstract one. Hence, the gesture would enact or depict the concrete grounds of an abstract concept. Genevi`eve Calbris (1990: 194–195) who was another one of the ﬁrst researchers to identify metaphoric gestures, puts it in the following way: “In a way, gesture attests to the metaphor passing from (a) something concrete to (b) the physical representation of something abstract.” She gives the exam- ple of a gesture where the two palms fac- ing each other are moved apart: in one con- text the gesture depicts the broadness of a concrete path, “(a) A path * this wide,” while in another context it represents the broad range of work which has to be done, “(b) A fairly * extensive work to be put into images.” McNeill (1992: 14) argues along sim- ilar lines when contrasting metaphoric ges- tures with iconic ones: “Other gestures are ‘metaphoric.’ These are like iconic gestures in that they are pictorial, but the picto- rial content presents an abstract idea rather than a concrete object or event. The ges- ture presents an image of the invisible – an image of an abstraction.” M¨uller (1998b) argues that McNeill’s iconic and metaphoric gestures are in fact both equally iconic signs, but what distinguishes them is whether they depict aspects of the referent itself (concrete reference) – which could be an entity, action, or relation – or aspects of the entity, action, or relation in terms of which the referent is being characterized (metaphoric [abstract] reference). It is certainly often the case that metaphoric gestures depict the abstract in terms of the concrete; yet, we would like to point out that metaphoricity is not reduced to conceptualizing the abstract in terms of the concrete. Rather metaphor is a cognitive procedure of understanding one thing in terms of another and hence may also apply to two concrete entities – such as for instance characterizing a woman’s body gesturally in terms of an hourglass, or when accounting verbally for all kinds of objects in terms of body parts, as is the case in expressions such as: the foot of a mountain, the leg of a table, or the arm of chair. Therefore, we are calling\n486 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER metaphoric gestures the ones which have the potential to engage an active cross-domain mapping, that is, the cognitive process of understanding something in terms of some- thing else (cf. Cienki, 1998, in press; M¨uller, 2004b/in press a).2 It is worth a historical aside that the study of human gestures is not restricted to gestu- ral expressions of metaphors. In contrast, the concept of metaphoric gestures has played a minor role in 2,000 years of gesture studies, while the focus was on expressive, regulat- ing, and discursive functions of gestures – from Quintilian to Bulwer to Austin (cf. Kendon, 2004; M¨uller, 1998b, 2000, 2002, 2004b/in press a). Theorists of rhetori- cal gesture since Quintilian have explic- itly neglected and prohibited (!) the use of iconic gestures – because it was essential for the Roman orator to distinguish him- self very clearly from the pantomimes who produced pantomimic performances of the ancient Greek dramas for the lower classes (cf. Quintilian: Inst. orat. XI 3, 89). Another important argument made against using and studying iconic gestures was that people who use too many gestures are unable to use vocal language in an adequate way. In other words, despite a long-standing tradition of gesture studies, gestures which iconically depict something be it concrete or abstract only garnered the attention of gesture schol- ars in the 20th century. Because of its primary focus on expres- sive and regulatory aspects of bodily behav- ior, research on nonverbal communication has widely ignored the study of gestures as a companion of spoken language. Hence, it is only with the cognitive turn in the eight- ies and nineties of the 20th century that co- verbal gesturing was considered a valuable phenomenon to study. Although the pio- neering work of David Efron (1972/1941), republished by Paul Ekman, made an impor- tant point for the study of gestures, it was only with the studies by Adam Kendon (1980) and David McNeill (1985) that ges- tures came to be widely recognized not only as “illustrators” of speech (as Ekman & Friesen’s (1969) terminology suggests) but as intrinsic parts of an utterance. Kendon (1980: 211) characterizes this role of gestures accordingly “[. . .] as if the speech produc- tion process is manifested in two forms of activity simultaneously: in the vocal organs and also in bodily movement.” It is in the same line of thought that McNeill (1985, 1987, 1989, 1992) then puts forward a rad- ically different theory of language, gesture, and thought, arguing that gestures are ver- bal, and not nonverbal as implied by the concept of nonverbal communication: “[. . .] that the whole of gesture and speech can be encompassed in a uniﬁed conception, with gesture as a part of the psychology of speak- ing, along with, and not fundamentally dif- ferent from, speech itslf” (McNeill, 1985: 351). Since the publication of his mono- graph Hand and mind: What gestures reveal about thought (McNeill, 1992) a few years later, the study of human gestures has turned into a vividly expanding ﬁeld in psychology, psycholinguistics, artiﬁcial intelligence, engi- neering, cognitive and linguistic anthropol- ogy, cognitive linguistics, and more recently also in metaphor theory. Gesture is being studied to gain insights into issues such as the relationship between language and thought, embodiment and cognition, metaphor and thought, the structure of mind, linguistic rel- ativity, thinking for speaking, the cognitive and social processes involved in the develop- ment of human semiosis, and the origin and nature of the human capacity for language. Though we will be focusing here on ges- ture with spoken languages, one can also ﬁnd examples of manual gesture in signed lan- guages. Since the signs in a signed language are produced using the hands and forearms (in addition to other body parts), gesture has a different character than it does with spoken language. It is important to distin- guish what manual forms, positions, and/or movements constitute canonical elements of the signs of the language and which have been optionally added. Liddell (2003b), for example, observes that properties of certain signs which are gradient in nature can be thought of as gestural, namely: the loca- tion of the sign (for pointing or depicting) or the orientation of the sign (for certain verbs) which may be overlaid on some signs\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 487 (see also Okrent, 2002, and Liddell, 2003a). Gestures can also occur interpersed between signs. Emmorey (1999) and Okrent (2002) each give examples in which signers make a questioning gesture in between two signs of an utterance in American Sign Language. In both cases, the gesture is made using two raised open hands (Emmorey glosses the questioning palm-up gesture in her example as “well-what”). While neither author specif- ically discusses these as metaphoric gestures, one could argue for a metaphorical moti- vation behind the upward hand position, reﬂecting the UNKNOWN AS UP. (See M¨uller, 2004a, on the frequent use of this gesture form to express the fact of not knowing, among other uses.) However, Okrent (2002: 183) discusses these as “gestures that inter- rupt the sign stream,” rather than as gestures co-occurring with sign. Therefore, in con- trast with metaphoric gestures with speech, it appears that spontaneous metaphoric ges- tures do not occur as independent forms that are produced simultaneously with signs. To summarize, we characterize meta- phoric gestures, regardless of the context of their occurrence (sign or spoken language), as voluntary movements of the body which use a cross-domain mapping to express cer- tain thoughts or feelings. How Metaphoric Gestures May Relate to Speech The relationship between metaphor and ges- ture is not always “straightforward.” Since the details of how and when metaphors are expressed gesturally can give us new insights into metaphor and thought, we will give some attention to the different kinds of relations that have been found between metaphoric gestures and the co-occurring speech. The Same Metaphor May Be Expressed in Speech and in Gesture Perhaps the least surprising use of a meta- phoric gesture occurs when it accompa- nies an utterance with a verbal metaphoric expression. For example, in a data set recorded by Cienki, consisting of videotaped conversations among American students about what it means for them to take an exam honestly, one participant makes the following observation about some students. (EXAMPLE 1) (1a) (1b) 1 [And I think that they’re willing to PUSH (2a) (2b) their moral LIMits, (. . .) 2 to the exTENT, that they CAN or cannot be LAbelled cheating.]3 While the speaker made gestures accom- panying all of these phrases, let us focus on the two produced with the ﬁrst tran- scribed line of speech. In gesture 1a, the speaker forms a ﬁst with her dominant (left) hand, and in 1b she pushes the ﬁst slightly forward. In gesture 2, she changes her left hand shape so that it is half-open with ﬁn- gers together, making a solid, curved form, palm vertical, facing center space. In 2b, she moves the hand shape outward from her- self. The speech and gesture describe a scene in which the possibilities for which behav- iors can be considered moral are mapped onto the amount of space in which one can physically move. This correlates with the metaphor which Lakoff (1996/2002) and others have analyzed as MORAL ACTION IS BOUNDED MOVEMENT. This is the model according to which we understand behavior as motion along a path and immoral behav- ior as straying from the path of what is right. (Evidence of how this metaphor has per- sisted over time can be found in the origins of the word deviance, from the Latin spa- tial meaning of “away from the road” – de via.) Extending the potential for evaluating some behavior as moral or not is described here verbally as pushing a moral limit, which is shown with the formation and movement outward of the ﬁst. In addition, the notion of MORAL CONCEPTS AS BOUNDED SPACES is invoked in speech with reference to moral limits. This is also depicted in manual form as a curved surface with the hand. The\n488 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER scenario of the moral limits being pushed is shown as the curved hand moves outward from the speaker. Compare the notion that TO CHANGE ONE’S BEHAVIOR IS TO MOVE FROM ONE SPACE TO ANOTHER, as seen in expressions like overstepping one’s bounds, sailing into unknown waters, and crossing the line (discussed in Cienki, 1997). In our example, the questionable nature of the ethics involved is expressed in speech and gesture as an alteration being made in the location of the moral boundary. Also note that here, as in many instances, the formation of the gesture preceded the utterance of its lexical afﬁliate, the word that relates to it semantically. McNeill and Duncan (2000) argue that the fact that ges- tures frequently precede their lexical afﬁli- ates is evidence in support of the hypothesis that visual and verbal elements are inte- grated in an idea unit, and then “unpacked” as it is expressed in speech and gesture. In another example (this one from M¨uller, 2004b/in press a), a German speaker describes her relationship with her ﬁrst boyfriend as having been klebrig (“clingy”), as he was too dependent on her. The gesture she makes during the quoted example, lead- ing up to using the word klebrig, consists of her slowly and repeatedly pressing the palms of her two open hands together. (EXAMPLE 2) open palms touch each other repeatedly 1 [also da hab ich schon gemerkt naja \\ des is: ganz “well there I did already realize well \\ this is really hands clap repeatedly 2 sch¨o:n (-) (mh) (-) klebrig \\ oder heftig] pretty (-) (mh) (-) clingy \\ or heavy” Rather than depicting a source domain object mentioned in speech, as in the previ- ous example, this speaker portrays the man- ner of interacting with a clingy substance, which she likens to the quality of the emo- tional interaction in this relationship. Once again, the metaphor was expressed gestu- rally before it was verbalized. To conclude, gestural metaphors may be semantically co-expressive with speech but temporally detached from the verbal metaphor: they can begin before the co- expressive verbal item is produced, over- lap with it and proceed after it is uttered. Gesture and speech therefore appear to share the communicative burden to express one and the same metaphor, which means that metaphor is not limited to the ver- bal medium of expression. In other words, it can be multi-modal, appearing as a verbo-gestural metaphoric expression (see M¨uller, 2004b/in press a; M¨uller & Cienki, to appear). A Metaphor May Be Expressed in Gesture, But Not in the Co-occurring Speech Consider the following example (analyzed in Cienki, 1998) from the student conversa- tions about honesty, mentioned earlier. One speaker says, with several restarts, (EXAMPLE 3) Like dishonest suggests, like, um, not truthful, lh ﬂat OH, PC like, [the TRUTH is what], like,4 On the word “truth” (uttered with emphasis, indicated by the capital letters) he makes a ﬂat-hand gesture with his left hand in the vertical plane, ﬁngers pointing away from his body. Though he does not say anything in this context (or in the subsequent utter- ances), characterizing TRUTH as metaphori- cally STRAIGHT, that is what appears to be represented in the gesture. The fact that there are linguistic expressions in English which reﬂect a conceptualization of TRUTH or HONESTY AS STRAIGHT, for example, referring to honest speech as straight talk, supports the interpretation that this com- mon metaphor in the culture may have been behind the production of this gesture in this context. Calbris (1990; Calbris & Porcher, 1989) notes the following context of gesture use in which a metaphor is expressed in the ges- ture, but not in the co-occurring speech: while uttering a word with an abstract meaning, one sometimes produces a ges- ture which reﬂects the concrete origins of\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 489 the word. Calbris (1990: 196–198) refers to these as etymological gestures. For exam- ple, talking about a repetition of an event while making a vertical loop with one hand (in Calbris’ notation, an asterisk * indicates the occurrence of the gesture): “No, paid programs * for retraining.” In the original French, the speaker used the verb se recy- cler, which is from the Greek kuklos, “circle.” Another example is cited in M¨uller (2004b: 95–99) in which a speaker talks about psy- chological depression with the phrase “durch dieses depressive” (‘because of this depres- siveness’) and repeatedly makes a slow, downward movement with her right hand palm down, thumb, and foreﬁnger forming a ring shape. Yet, the origin of German Depres- sivit¨at in the Latin verb deprimere/depressio “to press down” is not transparent to the average German speaker of today, for whom this spatial concept would be expressed with a different verb: dr¨ucken. But the notion that SAD IS DOWN, apparent in the develop- ment of the word’s abstract meaning, reap- pears in a gesture with speech. How can this be? Apparently, a conceptual metaphor which motivated the extension of a word to an abstract domain can still be active in a culture and continue to constitute an imagistic way of thinking about the idea, even if it is no longer transparent in the form of the word itself. This may be man- ifested in a gesture, even if the metaphoric source domain is not explicitly mentioned in the utterance, or ever as a metaphorical expression in the contemporary language. Lakoff and Turner (1989) discuss this issue in the context of rejecting what they term the dead metaphor theory. They argue that metaphors may appear dead on the verbal level but still have the potential to be vital conceptually; in other words, they are no longer used to refer literally; hence, “com- prehend” is no longer used in the sense of “to grasp” as in Latin, but the conceptual metaphor UNDERSTANDING IS GRASPING is alive and active in contemporary English (as in “to grasp what someone else is saying”). McNeill (1992) discusses another cate- gory of metaphoric gestures which occur without the utterance of explicit metaphoric expressions. They consist of instances in which mention of a topic of conversation or a question is accompanied by the hands in a position as if holding an object, as in the following example (McNeill, 1992: 148): (EXAMPLE 4) bh OH rise up, PC || bh move outward and down PU as three outer ﬁngers close [it was a Sylves || ter and Tweety cartoon] During the ﬁrst bracketed phrase, the speaker, who is sitting, has his elbows on the arms of his chair and raises both hands up, palms open and facing each other. During the second phrase in bold type, his hands move apart, forearms rotating outward at the elbows, while three ﬁngers on each hand close (middle, ring, and pinky), leaving the pointers and thumbs extended. Here, the topic being referred to was a speciﬁc exam- ple of a genre, that of a type of cartoon. McNeill describes the ﬁrst gesture as one like holding up an object, and the second one like pulling the object open. (The thumbs and foreﬁngers which remain extended could be interpreted as still showing the outer bound- aries of the object.) McNeill argues that this and similar gestures are examples of what Reddy (1993/1979) found in his analy- sis of our language about language, namely, that we often talk (and presumably think) about units of language (words, sentences, whole texts, and even genres) as if they were containers for meaning. Consequently, we often conceptualize, and talk about, com- munication as if it entailed a simple trans- fer of language-objects from one person to another. Comprehension should therefore be a simple matter of taking out the meaning that is in the container of language. Although a bit of reﬂection reveals that effective com- munication indeed involves more effort than our folk model implies. Reddy refers to this as the conduit metaphor, although as Lakoff and Johnson (1980: 10) note, several concep- tual metaphors can come into play, such as LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAIN- ERS, IDEAS ARE OBJECTS, and COMMUNI- CATION IS SENDING. With the example above, we see that even when no mention is made of the metaphor in the accompany- ing speech, the metaphor of CARTOON AS\n490 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER OBJECT appears in the gesture. The gesture shows the metaphoric objectiﬁcation of the genre referred to in speech. Perhaps because McNeill’s (1992) book was the ﬁrst widely distributed volume in English on gesture studies, this one type of metaphoric gesture (expressing the CONDUIT metaphor) has become frequently cited as the kind of ges- ture that is metaphoric, leading to assump- tions that metaphoric gestures can only serve this one function. Although it is a frequently occurring type of metaphoric gesture, it is just one type among many. Gestures discussed as examples of the conduit metaphor actually fall into several groups. The type discussed above concerns a medium of expression as a container. Another type of conduit metaphoric ges- tures concern what is in the metaphoric con- tainer, namely, the idea(s). These gestures express the metaphor of IDEA AS OBJECT. M¨uller (2004a) studies uses of the palm- up open-hand gesture, and suggests that its functional core is to present the speaker’s idea, as if it were an object on the ﬂat open hand, available for joint inspection. Note the implicit relation to the metaphor of KNOW- ING IS SEEING here: the gesture proposes a common means of looking at the presented object and metaphorically, it offers knowl- edge to be shared. We can think of this as a shared perspective, in both senses of the word (a visual point of view, and a particu- lar way of understanding something). M¨uller (2004a: 242) provides an example of a Spanish speaker proposing her perspec- tive of what happens to the characters in a particular novel, and it is a perspective which she knows differs from that of her interlocu- tor. She says, (EXAMPLE 5) PUOH lh PUOH lh (. . .) [las pasa bruta (.)] PVOH lh up & down, repeated eso si “they experience brutal things yes indeed” During the bracketed phrase, the speaker moves her left hand, open with palm up, in a downward motion and then holds it there. The metaphoric reference is not directed to a speciﬁc lexical item in the utterance, like in the examples we have seen earlier, but instead the target referent is the fact of presenting an idea. Here, the palm-up open hand is a metaphoric gesture that is serv- ing a different function in that it relates to the meta-narrative level; it reﬂects the fact that an idea is being presented, rather than reﬂecting particularities of the idea itself. In this way, it can be considered a pragmatic use of a metaphoric gesture. McNeill, Cassell, and Levy (1993: 12) dis- cuss another kind of gesture which functions at the meta-narrative level, namely, point- ing to spaces in front of the speaker when introducing a new event in a story. In their example, the speaker is retelling the story of a movie to someone who has not seen it. After describing how one scene ends, the speaker says, (EXAMPLE 6) point down right and then the next time we see [anyone] and points down to the right. McNeill et al. classify this as a deictic gesture which indi- cates the position of a new scene. We would argue that this use of abstract deixis could also be considered metaphoric, if the ges- ture is interpreted as pointing to an EVENT (a new scene) AS AN OBJECT. McNeill et al. contrast this with pointing which relates to elements in the narrative itself, for example, pointing to where characters physically were in the scene when they are ﬁrst mentioned; we would consider this another form of metaphoric use of pointing gestures. Another context in which metaphoric gestures occur independent of metaphoric speech is when a logical relation that is being talked about is shown gesturally as a spa- tial opposition. In the data from students discussing exam-taking practices, one partic- ipant talks about factors which determine the amount of effort that one will put into preparing for an exam. She concludes, “It depends on the student, but it also depends on the teacher.” While uttering the word “depends” the ﬁrst time, she sets her two\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 491 hands, palms down, into a space on her right side. She then lifts them and places them back down, but on her left side when she utters “also” at the start of the second phrase. The two gestures lay out the two condi- tions in her argument as separate spaces in front of her. This provides another example of metaphoric gesture at the pragmatic level, here: distinguishing different parts of the argument being made as separate spaces. (See also McNeill’s [1992: 155] example of a speaker setting up contrasting spaces for dif- ferent moral statuses of the characters he is describing – the “good guys” versus the “bad guy.”) Finally, ideas can be indicated not only as points in space but also in an objective way by using parts of the hands as objects to stand for them. Sweetser (1998) notes how even the common gesture of using the index ﬁnger of one hand to point to successive ﬁn- gers of the other hand while listing ideas or making different points of an argument is an example of gesturally manifesting the metaphor of IDEAS AS OBJECTS. Different Metaphors May Be Expressed in Speech and Gesture In some instances, one metaphor may be expressed in speech, while at the same time, the target domain for that metaphor is being characterized via a different source domain in a gesture. In example (7) from Cienki (in press), the speaker is talking about moral qualities in two categories, as either black or white. (EXAMPLE 7) 1 [y’know, there- there is no gradations. lh PUOH, repeats slight- rh PV strikes lh ly to right 2 Either you’re right you’re wrong repeats repeats to left to right ‘r black ‘r white, y’know.] At the same time, she is making a chop- ping gesture with the side of her right hand against the ﬂat palm of her left hand, as if dividing space; so, we have a “color” metaphor in speech, but a spatial metaphor in gesture. However, the two characteriza- tions of the target domain cohere in that the two source domains can constitute different qualities of the same scene, namely, two spa- tial areas clearly delimited, with one black and one white. While in this example the source domain mentioned verbally could not be represented spatially (with a “black” or “white” gesture), it remains to be seen in future research whether different verbal and gestural rep- resentations only occur in this circumstance, or whether in some instances a potentially “gesturable” source domain that is verbal- ized is not used in favor of a different one in order to highlight multiple aspects of a source domain scene. This kind of inde- pendence between the content conveyed in gesture and in speech is not restricted to metaphoric gesture and speech: witness the gesture-speech mismatches researched by Goldin-Meadow (2003). Studying chil- dren as they tried to solve Piagetian con- servation tasks and math problems, she found that children may give gestural evidence of understanding some concept before they can verbally articulate the same idea. A Metaphor May Be Expressed in Gesture Which Is Not One That Is Used in the Language In some cases, a metaphoric gesture accom- panies non-metaphoric language, and the metaphor structuring the gesture is never used in the language system itself. There is an elaborate example in Cienki (1998) of a stu- dent setting up two different events in time: the preparation for an exam, and the taking (writing) of the exam. Ex. (8) is an excerpt. (EXAMPLE 8) bh PD on right rh ﬁngers curl 1 [and you’re taking this test, bh PD move to left 2 but you have this guilt beforehand, bh make rotating motion as they move from left to right 3 but it doesn’t save (. . .)]\n492 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER The speaker explicitly sets up two time frames in separate spaces, prior time to the left and later time to the right. This arrange- ment of TIME AS SPACE is familiar to speak- ers of Indo-European languages (among oth- ers) and likely relates to the fact that our writing systems have a left-to-right orienta- tion (Calbris, 1990; M¨uller, 2000). We can also cite the role of this visuo-spatial meta- phor in mathematical graphs, in which the “progression” from lower to higher values is to the right, and in time lines, normally ori- ented with the future to the right. However, one does not say in English that someone did X “to the left of” Y to mean that someone did X before Y. Therefore, we see that ges- ture can be a source of data on (conceptual) metaphors which are employed by members of a culture and which may relate to visuo- spatial thinking, but which may not appear in verbal/linguistic modes of expression. Metaphoric Gestures in Different Cultures In the relatively short span of history in which there has been research on meta- phoric gestures, there is evidence of their existence from a variety of cultures. As noted earlier, Calbris’s study from 1990 is based on French speakers. The research we have cited is based on English, German, and Spanish. Cienki (1999) compares meta- phoric gestures produced by Russian speak- ers talking about “honesty” and “decency.” Zalazinska (2001) discusses metaphoric ges- tures in Polish for abstract concepts such as “nothing,” “to want,” “to need,” and others. However, these studies all concern lan- guages of European origin. While some research on non-Indo-European languages indicates similarities with the ﬁndings pre- viously discussed (such as the use in Geor- gian of a cup-shaped palm-up hand when presenting an idea [McNeill, 1992: 151–152]), other studies reveal some signiﬁcant differ- ences. For example, the metaphor of the FUTURE AS AHEAD does not hold universally: wit- ness the native South American language Aymara, whose speakers talk and gesture about the future as behind oneself, rather than ahead (N´u˜nez & Sweetser, 2001, 2006). Here the motivation is a different experien- tial basis for the conceptual metaphor. Based on the metaphor that KNOWING IS SEEING, the future is unknown, and thus behind us, where we cannot see. This contrasts with the metaphor in this culture that the PAST IS AHEAD, because it is known, and therefore in the realm in front of us, which we can see. Some other cross-cultural research, much of it originating at the Max Planck Insti- tute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, has revealed notable differ- ences in gesture systems which raise ques- tions for the study of metaphoric gestures. One important difference is that in some languages and cultures the default frame of spatial reference is based on the surrounding geography, rather than being relative with respect to the objects in question and the perspective of them that is assumed – for example, saying in English that “the man is standing to the left of the tree.” In the Australian language Arrernte, for example, one would say the equivalent of “the man is standing on the east side” of the tree, if that cardinal direction was accurate given the physical positions of the man and tree at the moment (Pederson et al., 1998). This is not just a matter of language but has been shown to be a factor of using what some call an absolute frame of reference in spatial reasoning (see Levinson, 2003, for a survey of the research on cross-cultural diversity regarding space in language and cognition). Spontaneous gestures by speak- ers of such languages are affected accord- ingly. Haviland (2000: 13) notes that speak- ers of another Australian language, Guugu Yimithirr, “assiduously orient pointing ges- tures in the ‘correct’ compass directions” when talking about location or motion as part of a story about an event, regardless of the angle at which they are seated when telling the story. Such ﬁndings raise ques- tions for future research about how speak- ers of spatially “absolute” languages gesture metaphorically. To conclude: metaphoric gestures may indeed relate to speech in a variety of ways, and there is variation as well as consistency across cultures. The speciﬁc forms of the interplay between gesture and\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 493 speech reveals that the issue of metaphor and gesture is not reducible to a mere “illus- tration” of metaphoric lexemes through a gestural depiction of a source domain. It is also not reducible to metaphoric discur- sive gestures. Rather gestures appear as an articulatory independent mode of expres- sion which is used ﬂexibly, and not only to illustrate the semantic content expressed verbally, nor only to treat abstract discourse objects metaphorically (see Bohle, 2004). The Study of Gesture, Metaphor, and Thought In this section, we offer an overview of the range and the nature of insights to be gained when studying gesture in relation to metaphor and thought. Although this whole ﬁeld of research is still in its beginnings, there is already a signiﬁcant range of observa- tions and ﬁndings, some of which carry chal- lenging implications for current theories of metaphor as well as for future research. What Does the Study of Gesture Reveal about Metaphor and Thought? METAPHOR AS A GENERAL COGNITIVE PRINCIPLE That metaphors may be realized in gestures as well as in speech adds support to the assumption that the creation of metaphors is based on a general cognitive principle rather than being a property of language only (cf. Cienki, 1998; Johnson, 1987; Lakoff & John- son, 1980, 1999; M¨uller, 2004b/in press a). We should therefore be prepared to think about metaphors independently from a spe- ciﬁc modality and – as a further conse- quence – take metaphors as fundamentally multimodal. Metaphors are not only instan- tiated in gestures, in pictures (Forceville, 1996), in ritual (Shore, 1996; Strauss & Quinn, 1997), and of course in spoken and in written language, but they also appear in combinations: there are verbo-pictorial metaphors (Forceville, 1996), verbo-gestural metaphors (M¨uller, 2004b/in press a), and combinations of differing verbal and gestural metaphors (Cienki, 1998; see also Forceville & Urios-Aparisi, to appear). Metaphors may also be realized on the verbal level but not on the pictorial or gestural level (Cienki, 1998; M¨uller, 2004b/in press a), and, as we have documented previously, there are gestural metaphors only – without any metaphoric expression in the co-occuring speech (Cienki, 1998). Finally, gestures drawing upon the source domains of con- ceptual metaphors may indicate that con- ceptual metaphors function widely as a vital and productive basis of verbal metaphoric expressions. Metaphoricity is therefore to be conceived of as a general cognitive principle resulting in metaphoric expressions of vari- ous modalities as well as in the creation of new conceptual metaphors. METAPHORIC MAPPINGS AND ON-LINE PROCESSING Gibbs and Colston (1995: 354) note, “Psy- chologists often contend that cognitive linguistic research suffers from circular reasoning in that it starts with an analysis of language to infer something about the mind and body which in turn motivates different aspects of linguistic structure and behavior.” Conceptual metaphor theory, as one of the original areas of cognitive linguistic research, can be considered one of the objects of this critique: the argument is made that metaphoric expressions in language are evidence of certain conceptual metaphors, and that we know this because we ﬁnd these conceptual metaphors in the language. Ges- ture, while a co-verbal behavior, involves a different modality of expression than speech and so provides another source of evidence for conceptual metaphors. In particular, gesture data can support arguments about the employment of conceptual metaphors in thought processes while speaking (see below). This provides one response to the criticism that “the linguistic evidence by itself [cited in research on conceptual metaphor theory] is dubious, because it assumes that a certain pattern in speech directly reﬂects conceptual structure” (Murphy, 1997). Gesture provides another window to understand how we structure concepts, and how we use those structures while speaking.\n494 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER Gestures can indicate that conceptual metaphors are also cognitively activated when not present in speech. This offers fur- ther support for the psychological reality of conceptual metaphors independent from the existing data based of spoken and writ- ten examples. Conceptual metaphors can function as active cognitive structures even when they do not trigger verbal metaphoric expressions. Finally, the analysis of verbo-gestural metaphors shows that seemingly “dead” ver- bal metaphors (i.e., highly conventionalized metaphors) may still be processed actively as metaphoric expressions. This contrasts with one of the fundamental assumptions of established metaphor theories (in the rhetoric tradition), namely, that a conven- tionalized verbal metaphor is no metaphor at all because it “no longer has a pregnant metaphorical use” (Black, 1993: 25). Ges- tures enacting the source of a convention- alized verbal metaphor provide signiﬁcant evidence that this assumption is false (see M¨uller, 2004b/in press a). It appears noteworthy to add that ges- tures are not just of scholarly interest, as windows onto thought, but they appear to be relevant for language understanding in everyday communication. Beattie and col- leagues have shown in multiple experimen- tal studies that recipients take up and use the information encoded gesturally. Both modal- ities – gesture and speech – appear to share the burden of conveying information; yet, sometimes information given gesturally has a higher impact and is better remembered than information given only verbally (cf., Beattie, 2003; Beattie & Shovelton, 2001). This suggests that metaphoric mappings embodied gesturally may also be understood as metaphors. But, at present, this is a con- jecture which remains to be grounded in empirical studies. FLEXIBILITY OF ON-LINE METAPHORIC THOUGHT The study of gesture and metaphor may be taken as a window onto thought in McNeill’s terms and offer insights into the dynamic development of processes and forms of imagistic, visuo-spatial, embodied thinking underlying metaphoric expressions. McNeill (1992, 1997), drawing on work by Vygotsky, has given particular attention to how the expression of thought via speech and ges- ture is not a unidirectional process. Rather, thought, speech, and gesture interact and shape each other as the speaker expresses an idea unit (what McNeill calls a “growth point”) in which imagistic and propositional modes of thinking interact. Similarly, Slobin (1987 and elsewhere) has been exploring the dynamic interrelations between thought and speech, and speciﬁcally, the “special form of thought that is mobilized for communica- tion,” which he calls “thinking for speaking.” McNeill and Duncan (2000) integrate these strands of research, arguing that the growth point consists of the imagistic nature of an idea as it is being integrated into the lin- guistic categories available for its expression in the language. In this regard, metaphoric gestures appear to play an important role for speakers in various ways as they formu- late their imagistic understanding of abstract concepts into linguistic expressions. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that ges- tures just produced could even prompt the realization of new images as one is thinking for speaking, and so initiate thinking in terms of new metaphors, giving rise to the use of other verbal metaphoric expressions in the subsequent speech (Cienki, 2000). Investigations into questions of linguis- tic relativity and/or universals have prof- ited much from using gesture analyses as windows onto active thought patterns dur- ing speaking. This cross-cultural research has once more documented that the study of gestures may provide crucial insights into forms of thought active during speak- ing, independent of what can be gleaned from spoken language alone. Using the ges- ture space to perform deictic gestures in an absolute frame of reference, as in Havi- land’s (1993, 2000) Guugu Yimithirr narra- tion, indicates that the linguistic categories and the semiotics of the gesture system draw on the same cognitive frame of refer- ence. Further research on language and cul- tures which commonly use absolute spatial\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 495 reference would provide a more complete picture about which ways of using gestures metaphorically appear to be more universal, and which are more culture speciﬁc. METAPHORICITY IS DYNAMIC AND GRADABLE So far metaphorictiy has been primarily con- ceived of as a stable property of words and/or concepts; a verbal expression or a conceptual metaphor tended to be regarded as either vital / productive, or as dead / unproduc- tive. However, a number of researchers (e.g., Cameron, 2003; Fauconnier & Turner, 1998; Grady, Oakley, & Coulson, 1999; Steen, 2002) have pointed out that the salience of metaphors, particularly the recognizabil- ity of verbal metaphoric expressions, differs according to various factors, such as gram- matical category, semantics, context within the text, and genre. Metaphoricity is thus gradable, and factors such as these inﬂuence whether someone will realize an expression as metaphoric. Looking at the ways in which verbal and gestural metaphors are integrated into ongoing utterances is a way in which we uncover how metaphoricity is gradable and hence a dynamic, not a static, property. The argument is an iconic and an interactive one: the more cues that direct the atten- tion of the interlocutors to the metaphoric quality of a verbal metaphoric expression, the higher the degree of cognitive activa- tion of metaphoricity in the speaker (and also potentially the addressee). One case would be metaphoric gestures which con- stitute an obligatory part of an utterance in the sense that they contain necessary infor- mation and ﬁll a lexical and syntactic gap. If they furthermore receive the speaker’s and listener’s gaze, and draw upon the same source domain as the verbal metaphoric expression, they must be conceived as fore- grounded, as receiving focused attention from both the speaker and the listener, and as displaying a high degree of speaker- internal activation of metaphoricity. When comparing metaphors which receive these attention-getting cues with others that go “unnoticed” (i.e., which are only expressed in one modality and are not accompanied by any cues such as prosodic stress or gaze direc- tion), it is clear that the latter type are not in the focus of interpersonal attention in the same way. Put another way, these clusters of attention-getting cues produce interactive foregrounding of metaphoricity and since what is interactively foregrounded is also intrapersonally foregrounded, metaphoric- ity should in these cases be highly activated intrapersonally. In short, the close interac- tion between the modalities and their verbal, bodily, and interactive context indicates that metaphoricity is a dynamic property and not a static one – that is, dynamic not only in gestural motion, but also in cognition (cf. M¨uller, 2004b/in press a, in press b). METAPHOR, GESTURE, AND EMBODIED COGNITION Gestures can spatially depict elements from the source domain of a metaphor, something which is not possible for metaphoric expres- sions in spoken languages. Many gestures, metaphoric and otherwise, take their form from everyday embodied activities, recreat- ing them iconically. M¨uller (1998a, 1998b) distinguishes four gestural modes of repre- sentation, that is, four forms of practices of gesture “creation.” Three of them bear directly upon embodied mundane practices of the hands: (1) hands act as if they would perform an instrumental action (opening a window, holding a steering wheel, present- ing an object on the open hand; (2) hands mold short-lived sculptures (the frame of a picture, the shape of a globe, a round object as representation for a love relationship); (3) hands draw routes on a map, the shape of a picture frame, or outline the ups and downs of a love relation as a graph. The interesting point is that the modes of rep- resentation are used not only to depict concrete activities or objects or properties of concrete objects but also to represent abstract metaphoric concepts. This fact sup- ports the hypothesis in cognitive linguis- tics that (many) metaphors are grounded in embodied action. (See Gibbs and Berg, 2002, on the broader questions about men- tal imagery and embodied activity, as well as\n496 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER the responses to their article in that journal issue. See also Gibbs, 2005, for a summary of different perspectives in the literature on speech and gesture and how these relate to larger questions about embodiment and cognition.) Compare also research on sign languages in which the physical depiction of metaphorical source domains has been shown to play a clear role in the use of metaphor (Taub, 2001; Wilcox, 2000). Implications of Gesture Studies for Future Research into Metaphor and Thought Taking the analysis of metaphoric gesture as a serious part of a cognitive linguistic analysis has some important implications for future research. It affects the data as well as the theoretical concepts. RECONSIDER DATA AND METHODS OF ANALYSIS USED IN METAPHOR RESEARCH Lakoff and Johnson (1980) not only laid the groundwork for a new theoretical direc- tion in the study of metaphor; this work also implicitly supported a particular kind of research methodology, one which takes constructed, but intuitively plausible, sen- tences as data. Only recently has more research appeared which draws on exam- ples from naturally occurring spoken inter- action, existing written texts, and/or data from larger corpora. In gesture studies, some research may cite plausible but constructed examples, but the very nature of sponta- neous gesture with speech – the fact that it is usually produced unwittingly and that it lacks standards of form (cf. McNeill, 1992) – weighs against the use of constructed data. Particularly, in recent research on metaphor in gesture, the data are almost exclusively video recordings of spontaneously produced co-verbal behavior. This also means that gesture researchers have been confronting the accompanying methodological questions of using natural data in their research on metaphoric gestures. In this way, gesture research cannot only help develop metaphor theories, it might also have an inﬂuence on the kinds of data that are studied and the methods by which they are examined. This could include giving greater promi- nence to spoken language data (and methods for working with it) in metaphor research. The focus on spoken language in the phys- ical setting of its use, inherently part of the video-recorded data used in most gesture studies, could help give greater attention to other questions in the study of metaphor. These include the role of where metaphor occurs in the discourse context, the function of metaphor in the interaction between par- ticipants in conversation, and the role of the physical setting (the context of interaction) as a prompt for, or grounding of, the use of speciﬁc metaphors. With greater use of naturally occurring linguistic data in the ﬁeld of metaphor studies, the methodology or methodologies for identifying metaphoric expressions in spoken discourse and written texts have begun to receive more attention in the research literature. For example, one group of researchers which has devised a reli- able procedure for metaphor identiﬁcation in texts is “Pragglejaz,” named after the ﬁrst initials of the 10 group members (Praggle- jaz Group, 2007). Perhaps a similar research group should be formed to develop reli- able procedures or guidelines for the iden- tiﬁcation of metaphoric gestures. However, the scope of what counts as a metaphoric expression, be it in words or gesture, will vary according to the goals of the research project. Some projects may have a broad scope, encompassing any expression with potential metaphoricity, while others may focus more narrowly on expressions which appear to indicate metaphoric processing by the speaker in real time. The important thing is to make one’s methodology for metaphor identiﬁcation clear and appropriate for the goals of one’s research. An additional topic, which can only be touched on brieﬂy here, concerns the method of presenting examples of metaphoric gestures in research presenta- tions and publications. Some, such as the journal Gesture, allow video data to be included in publications by providing a CD in each issue with relevant examples. Some\nMETAPHOR, GESTURE, AND THOUGHT 497 studies refer to Web Sites in which the video examples can be seen. Otherwise, we are left with drawings or verbal descriptions, for which there is no standard accepted in the ﬁeld. Indeed, drawings and verbal descriptions are already interpretations of the data themselves, just as written tran- scriptions of speech are, and such renderings inherently involve theoretical choices about inclusion and exclusion of detail, which need to be explicitly articulated in presentations of one’s research. By way of comparison, research published on metaphor in sign lan- guage usually employs written glosses from the dominant language of the country in which the sign language is used, but this is not possible with spontaneous gestures since the relation between form and meaning is not conventionalized. LABELING OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHORS Gestures range from those with commonly accepted forms and meanings (emblems) to those with spontaneously created forms, whose meanings are hidden in the subcon- scious of the gesturer. Since spontaneous gesture with speech does not constitute a symbolic system of communication like lan- guage itself does, we are confronted not only with challenges in describing the forms of the gestures but also with questions about labeling the conceptual metaphors which they may be expressing. In the framework of conceptual metaphor theory, it has not been seen as problematic to label the pro- posed cross-domain mappings in terms of words, in the formula TARGET DOMAIN IS SOURCE DOMAIN. However, the exam- ination of gestures and speech makes the potential problems with this method more obvious. To begin with, it entails the inter- pretation of a gestural form, and of the concept it might represent, in terms of a word or phrase. But it can be very difﬁcult (not to mention inadequate) to capture an embodied action which comprises a source domain in the form of a word or phrase. One solution might be to follow the model of cognitive grammar (Langacker, 1987, 1991) in using diagrams in the mechanics of the analysis, as suggested in Cienki (2005). However, this would require careful moti- vation for the schematic formation of the diagrams used, as has been observed in cog- nitive grammar analyses. Since gesture, and embodied concepts, involve motion, this should be incorporated as well in the expo- sition of the analysis. This is not an unrealis- tic expectation, given the developing use of computer graphics in the study of gesture. (See, for example, the method of image pro- cessing known as vector coherence mapping, employed in McNeill et al., 2001.) Conclusion: How the Study of Gesture Advances Our Understanding of the Research into Metaphor and Thought In this chapter, we have assembled a range of arguments in support of a position that re- orients the database of metaphor research from primarily relying on speaker-internal intuitions and dictionary knowledge of ver- bal metaphors toward the study of (spon- taneous) spoken language along with the gestures that speakers produce unwittingly whenever they talk. We have indicated that this new view of metaphors sheds light on fundamental issues of metaphor the- ory such as the still (after two millennia of scholarly reﬂection) nontrivial questions: What is metaphor? How do we ﬁnd out what metaphor is? We have argued that this depends strongly upon the empirical sources considered. Looking at gestures and speech shows that metaphor is a general cognitive principle and is not restricted to language alone. In this regard, our ﬁndings offer sup- port for a fundamental assumption of con- ceptual metaphor theory, although, notably, they break the vicious argumentative cir- cle that cognitive linguistics in general has been criticized for. Yet, what do we ﬁnd out about metaphor when we look at ges- ture and speech? We ﬁnd that metaphor – or more precisely the establishment of metaphoricity – is a cognitive activity which takes place online during the process of speaking. We ﬁnd that metaphor is clearly not restricted to language or a speciﬁc\n498 ALAN CIENKI AND CORNELIA M ¨ULLER linguistic or poetic principle. Rather it turns out that metaphor is a way thought is organized, and it is because the products of metaphoric thought have been studied mostly in their verbal forms that metaphor has been traditionally conceived of as a uniquely linguistic and poetic phenomenon. Taking spoken language and gestures into consideration uncovers that metaphors may be instantiated in various modalities, notably without necessarily drawing upon the same conceptual metaphor. Imagistic, embodied, and propositional modes of thinking inter- act during speaking (witness McNeill’s con- cept of the growth point) and gestures may trigger new verbal metaphoric expressions. Furthermore, the close analysis of the syntac- tic, semantic, prosodic, and bodily context of verbal and gestural metaphoric expressions reveals that metaphoricity is a dynamic not a static property of linguistic items, which may be more or less foregrounded and so may receive more or less focused attention. Studying metaphor, gesture, and speech in relation to thought opens up a range of new phenomena and facets of metaphor for fur- ther investigation – making a strong case for the need to incorporate the study of lan- guage use (including gesture) into research on metaphor and thought (see Cienki & M¨uller, in press). Notes 1 [Translation from German CM]: “Der allgemeine Charakter der symbolischen Geb¨arde besteht aber darin, daß sie die auszudr¨uckenden Vorstellungen aus einem Anschauungsgebiet in ein anderes ¨ubertr¨agt, also z.B. zeitliche Vorstellungen r¨aumlich andeutet, oder daß sie abstrakte Begriffe sinnlich veranschaulicht” (Wundt, 1922: 165). Wundt’s concept was taken up by Efron’s (1972/1941) category of ideographic gestures and McNeill’s (1992) concept of metaphoric gestures. 2 Cf. M¨uller’s (2004b/in press a) concept of activation of a triadic structure based on Wittgenstein’s concept of “seeing as,” Lakoff’s and Johnson’s “understanding and experienc- ing one kind of thing in terms of another” (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980: 5), and Richards’ cognitive conceptualization of metaphor as having “[. . .] two thoughts of different things active together and supported by a single word, or phrase, whose meaning is a resultant of their interaction.” (Richards, 1936: 93) 3 The following conventions are used in this chapter for transcribing speech: capitaliza- tion indicates emphasis; “(. . .)” indicates an ellipsis in the transcript; “:” indicates lengthening; “(.)” indicates micropause; ‘“(-)” indicates a slightly longer pause; “/” indicates rising intonation; “ \\ ” indicates falling intona- tion. In transcribing gestures, “[ ]” indicates the beginning and end of a gesture phrase, and bold type indicates the main stroke phase of a gesture. 4 Henceforth, the following additional conven- tions will be used in transcribing gestures: “rh” for right hand; “lh” for left hand; “bh” for both hands; “PU” for palm up; “PV” for palm vertical; “PC” for palm toward center; “PD” for palm down; “OH” for open hand; “||”for change of hand conﬁguration within one ges- ture phrase.

Zbikowski The music in Example 1 is a shorthand ver- sion of the string parts and solo bass melody from the opening of the fourth movement of Johann Sebastian Bach’s 1714 cantata for the ﬁrst Sunday of Advent, “Nun komm der Hei- den Heiland.” The music in the string parts for the passage might be described in one of two contrasting ways. The ﬁrst is more col- orful and more accessible: “The bass obsti- nately plods along throughout the passage; the chords above are either sour and bit- ing dissonances (as in the ﬁrst half of mea- sure 1, and all of measures 2–3) or sweet but dark consonances (as in the second half of measure 1, or at the end of the excerpt). The mostly murky sounds of the pizzicato strings, together with the slow tempo, make this a brooding, melancholy piece.” The sec- ond description is drier, and makes more use of technical jargon: “Above an ostinato tonic bass Bach sounds ﬁrst a dominant-seventh chord (in the opening portion of measure 1), and then a leading-tone chord with seventh (in measures 2–3). He provides momentary release for the tension created by these dis- sonances through the introduction of the tonic chord in the second half of measure 1 and then again at the conclusion of the passage.” In analyses of how language is used to characterize music, the ﬁrst description is typically characterized as metaphorical, the second as literal. The metaphors in the ﬁrst description are readily apparent: r the “plodding bass” is nothing more than a repeated note plucked by the cellos r the consonant harmonies of measures 1 and 4 and dissonant harmonies of mea- sures 1–3 are sounds, and so cannot taste like anything, sweet or sour r the dissonances in measures 1–3 are sim- ply a consequence of F♯and D♯sounding against the E in the bass – no mechanisms for biting are in evidence r as products of the resonance of a sounding medium the E minor chords of measures 1 and 4 have no particular reﬂectance and so can be neither dark nor light r even if we grant that what is meant by the characterization of the piece as “brooding and melancholy” is that it is expressive of these feelings, how can a simple sequence 502\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 503 =54 Sie he, - sie he, - ich ste he - vor der Tur und klo pfe - an, und klo pfe - an. Example 1. Measures 1–4 of the fourth movement (Recitativo) from J. S. Bach’s cantata “Nun komm der Heiden Heiland” (BWV 61). of sounds – which is not in any way sen- tient – express anything? It would appear that none of the things picked out by the ﬁrst description could in fact be found in the music – thus the metaphoricality of the description. The second description does seem to be more literal. The deﬁnition of an osti- nato is, indeed, a repeated pattern of notes. The pitches B-D♯-F♯-A are those of the dominant-seventh chord of E minor, and D♯-F♯-A-C are those of the leading-tone chord with seventh. With mention of ten- sion and release in the second sentence we are, however, on somewhat shakier ground, for the dissonant chords in the passage require no more or less tension for their production than do the consonant chords. One might argue that such chords give all knowledgeable listeners the sensation of ten- sion and release, but this begs the question: the description is supposedly about a given musical passage, not a listener’s reaction to the passage. One solution would be to elim- inate the second sentence from the descrip- tion, but we would then be left with little more than a narrativized rendering of the musical terms that could be applied to this passage. It is the second sentence, with its metaphorical evocation of tension and release, that gives some indication of how the music sounds, rather than what musical elements it comprises. Metaphor seems to be an inescapable part of musical descrip- tions that aspire to more than a rehearsal of deﬁned terms. There are, of course, many areas of human experience about which discourse is resolutely metaphorical, emotions being a prominent example. What makes music special is its relationship to language. Both music and language, for instance, are unique to the human species, both unfold over time, both have syntactic properties, and both make use of sound. Indeed, the notion that music is a language is the basis for some of the most prevalent metaphors used to describe music. But music is also not like language in at least one important respect: aside from a limited number of exceptional cases when music mimics natural sounds, music makes no reference to the outside world. Music does make reference to – or perhaps embody – the interior world of emo- tions or physiological states, but it is just this world that typically escapes the grasp of non- metaphorical language. Given this situation, one could conceiv- ably trace connections between the phe- nomenon of metaphor and the cultural practice of music back to the earliest written records. (There is, for instance, a brief dis- cussion of metaphors used by Aristoxenus, a fourth-century BCE writer on music, in the introduction to Zbikowski, 2002.) The focus in this chapter, however, is on work that has contributed directly to discussions about metaphor and music and on theo- retical frameworks for understanding how the domain of music correlates with other conceptual domains, including that of lan- guage. Most of this work dates from the past 50 years, and encompasses a range of disciplines, including philosophy, semiotics, cognitive science, and the critical and ana- lytical study of music. It should be noted that scholars of music are often divided\n504 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI into three subdisciplines, reﬂecting different intellectual commitments. Although musi- cology is the most comprehensive term, it is currently used to refer to those whose research concentrates on music viewed as a historical practice; ethnomusicology, by con- trast, tends to focus on the social and cul- tural contexts of musical practice, with an emphasis on non-western music; music the- ory is concerned, by and large, with develop- ing systematic perspectives on musical orga- nization and on close readings of individual musical works based on these perspectives. The ﬁrst part of this chapter is given over to a historical and conceptual survey of music and metaphor (moving through a range of disciplines, including the three sub- disciplines of music scholarship), organized around some of the topics adumbrated in the discussion of my opening example. These include the status of knowledge about music, the nature of musical semiotics, the rela- tionship of music to other aspects of human experience (and in particular the expression of emotions), and music as a manifestation of human cognitive capacities. The second part of the chapter will return to the music of example 1 and explore a theoretical frame- work for analyzing how the domain of music correlates with other conceptual domains, including that of language. Research on Metaphor and Music Music and Knowledge Perhaps the ﬁrst extended discussion that connected music with metaphor appeared in the philosopher Nelson Goodman’s Lan- guages of Art (1968/1976). Goodman was interested in developing a theory of symbols that could apply to works of art as well as to natural language. According to this theory, a painting is a symbol (if of a rather special sort); so are a sequence of musical sounds or a sculpture. One distinctive feature of artis- tic symbols is that they are typically regarded as expressive: a gray-toned painting with a somber theme is thus described as “sad,” as would be a lugubrious melody in a minor key. For Goodman, such sadness is not an attribute of the symbol proper but is instead ﬁgurative or metaphorical: in describing the painting or the melody as “sad,” we transfer a system of concepts from its typical realm (the emotional states associated with sen- tient beings) into a new realm (colors and shapes on a canvas or a sequence of sonic events; Goodman, 1976, 72). The expressiv- ity of an art work is, in consequence, not an attribute of the work as such but is simply attributed to the work. Goodman’s account of the expressivity of works of art – and in particular, music – was met with two sorts of challenges. The ﬁrst, and most straightforward, came from philosophers who argued that the expressive character of a work is basic to it: expressiv- ity is an ineliminable property of the musical work. When Goodman relegated the sadness of a melody to the domain of the metaphor- ical, he simply missed the point, since the purpose of the melody was to be expressive of some emotion (Budd, 1989; Davies, 1994, 150–166). The second challenge to Goodman came from the philosopher Roger Scruton, who noted that Goodman’s approach made no place for human understanding – indeed, for Goodman artistic symbols and the expres- sive values attributed to them are com- pletely independent of human cognition (Scruton, 1974, 222). Scruton’s aesthetic theory, as a whole, sought to place works of art in the intentional realm; in subse- quent work on music this strategy led Scru- ton to argue that to hear various sounds as music (as opposed to unconnected if pleas- ant noises) requires construing such sounds in terms of concepts taken from some other domain. To take a simple example, when the bass sings the ﬁrst three notes of mea- sure three in Example 1 – C4-A3-F♯3 – we typically describe them as descending.1 This descent is, however, an illusion: not only does the singer remain where he is, but there is nothing in a scientiﬁc account of the sounds themselves that supports the notion that they descend. From Scruton’s perspective, this “illusion” is key to under- standing the sequence of notes as music: the “motion” that we ascribe to the sequence\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 505 of notes sung by the bass is a consequence of our framing their succession in terms of the motion of physical objects through space from low to high. This sort of metaphor- ical transfer – taking concepts from one domain (such as that of movement, or space, or concrete objects) and applying them to another – is essential to hearing sounds as music. “If we take away the metaphors of movement, of space, of chords as objects, of melodies as advancing and retreating, as moving up and down – if we take those metaphors away, nothing of music remains, but only sound” (Scruton, 1983, 106). Scruton took pains here and in later work to emphasize the disjunction between the properties of sounds and the properties of music, for this disjunction pointed directly to the intentionality of art works like music: There lies, in our most basic apprehension of music, a complex system of metaphor, which is the true description of no material fact, not even a fact about sounds, judged as secondary objects. The metaphor cannot be eliminated from the description of music, because it deﬁnes the intentional object of the musical experience. Take the metaphor away, and you cease to describe the expe- rience of music. (Scruton, 1997, 92) For those who placed little trust in metaphor as a tool for discovering the essen- tial properties of music, however, Scru- ton’s account of musical understanding was just as ﬂawed as Goodman’s, if in a dif- ferent way. Where Goodman isolated the fact of music from its expressivity, Scruton failed to explain how metaphorical state- ments connected with musical facts (Budd, 1985, 2003). Raising a similar objection, the music theorist Naomi Cumming noted that the sharp distinction between literal and ﬁgurative language that Scruton drew was ultimately untenable when the range of language used to describe music was consid- ered (Cumming, 1994, 2000, 49–51). This difﬁculty points to a problem com- mon in philosophical writings about music, which tend to treat language as the gold standard for conceptualization and gram- mar (see, for instance, Dempster, 1998). Against such a standard music comes off rather poorly, for it cannot supply the fac- tuality that is believed to mark language. A somewhat different, albeit related, problem stems from the special status granted instru- mental music by some nineteenth-century thinkers. As Lydia Goehr has observed, within German Romanticism “‘The purely musical’ . . . served as a general metaphor for all that was unknowable by ordinary cognitive or rational means” (Goehr, 1998, 18). For writers who adopt this perspec- tive the impenetrability of music is its rai- son d’ˆetre: “the musical mystery is not ‘what cannot be spoken of,’ the untellable, but the ineffable” (Jank´el´evitch, 2003, 72; see also Charles, 1995). The metaphors used to describe music – especially to the extent that the mechanisms behind these metaphors remain unexamined – are thus symptomatic of music’s ineffability. A ﬁnal complication is that accounts of metaphor grounded in the philosophy of language may simply be inad- equate for music, as can be seen in Steven Krantz’s application of Max Black’s theory of metaphor to music (Krantz, 1987), and as is demonstrated in Leo Treitler’s critique of Goodman (Treitler, 1997). Musical Semiotics The somewhat uncomfortable relationship between language and music evident in philosophical treatments of music and metaphor is also apparent in efforts to adapt semiotic theory to music. Hints that such an adaptation might be possible can be seen as early as Ferdinand de Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics, where, summing up the possibility of separating out the ele- ments of language for analysis, Saussure comments, “Similarly, a musical series do, re, mi can be treated only as a concrete series in time, but if I select one of its irreducible elements, I can study it in the abstract” (Saussure, 1959, 40). A half-century after Saussure the Belgian linguist Nicolas Ruwet, in what proved to be an inﬂuential essay, adopted a similar perspective for detailed analyses of four melodies from the middle ages (Ruwet, 1966; reprinted in Ruwet, 1972;\n506 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI (Slow) Moderate tempo Qui ( ) tol J.S. Bach, 1733 lis - ( ) Ich muss auch heu te - wan Franz Schubert, 1827 dern - Example 2. Two descending melodies from Cooke 1959 (from Cooke’s Ex. 58b, p. 134). for a discussion see Powers, 1980, 10–22). Limitations of the approach, however, soon became evident, especially where meaning was concerned. As the music theorist Koﬁ Agawu has observed, while it is the case that the basic units of language have a more or less ﬁxed lexical meaning, the basic units of music most typically do not (Agawu, 1999, 144). Related to this, the symbolic structure of language consists of a dense network of mutually interrelated symbols which typi- cally share little if anything with the things to which they refer (Deacon, 1997, chapter 3; 2003). The symbolic structure of music has nothing like this level of complexity: the relationships into which symbols enter are typically more local, and there tends not to be the sort of abstract reference typi- cal of linguistic symbols (see, however, the analyses in Agawu, 1991). Where the per- spectives of semiotic theory have reaped the most beneﬁt has not been in show- ing how music replicates the features of language but through explorations of how meaning speciﬁc to music – and in some cases beyond the capacities of language – is possible. Deryck Cooke, in The Language of Music, proposed that certain types of musical mate- rials (with a special focus on the intervals that occur between the notes of a melody) were expressive of certain types of emotions. For instance, Cooke proposed that a descent from the ﬁfth note of a minor scale through the ﬁrst, of the sort shown in the melodies of Example 2, expresses “acceptance of, or yielding to grief, discouragement and depression; passive suffering, and the despair connected with death” (Cooke, 1959, 133). Cooke’s account of the vocabulary of music is much more complex than suggested by this example (for instance, the descent from the ﬁfth through the ﬁrst note of the scale could be ﬁlled in with the fourth and second notes of the scale, or embellished in various ways) and much more detailed. Indeed, the very speciﬁcity Cooke offered may have told against him, for this provided fuel for crit- ics who argued that musical meaning was much more various than Cooke seemed to maintain. Nonetheless, Cooke’s basic idea – that musical meaning is tied up with the expression of emotion – is not only broadly accepted among musicians (as suggested by the commentary in Agawu, 1999, and the essays in Juslin and Sloboda, 2001) but has recently been the focus of further work. Jan Broeckx, for instance, has argued that musi- cal meaning is a consequence of the direct representation of emotion through musical ﬁgures (Broeckx, 1997). While we can cer- tainly describe these emotions through lan- guage (thus giving rise to the metaphori- cal descriptions of music’s expressivity) such descriptions do not create the meaning that the emotions have. Broeckx, however, does not develop his methodology further, and just how musical ﬁgures express emotions remains obscure. Hallgjerd Aksnes, for her part, has made use of current work in cogni- tive science and metaphor theory to bring clarity to this perspective, proposing that the emotions summoned by passages in the music of the Norwegian composer Geirr Tveitt can be grounded in embodied expe- rience (Aksnes, 2002, chapter 8). Addi- tional methodological support can be found in the composer and semiologist David Lidov’s work, recently brought together in Lidov (2005). Although metaphor the- ory does not ﬁgure large in Lidov’s theory of musical signiﬁcation, one can ﬁnd the integration of an approach sympathetic to Cooke with a general theory of semiotics. The result is a theory of musical mean- ing based on correlations between emotions, physical gestures, and sequences of musical events.\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 507 (Andante) 1 2 3 Träumerei Humoresque Träumerei 4 5 6 Humoresque Träumerei 7 8 9 Humoresque Träumerei Example 3. The melody of Schumann’s “Tr¨aumerei” combined with the melody of Dvoˇr´ak’s “Humoresque” (adapted from Example 4 from Karbusicky 1987, 436). Another perspective on musical mean- ing and its relationship to metaphor was provided by the musicologist Vladimir Karbusicky. Working from a thorough knowledge of the history of semiotic approaches developed by German musi- cologists under the inﬂuence of Ernst Cassirer, Karbusicky made a strenuous argu- ment against using semiotic theories for- mulated for language to explain musical meaning: “The popular deﬁnition of music as a kind of language or as auditive communica- tion, which has all too often been taken for granted even in scientiﬁc essays, is nothing more than a metaphor” (Karbusicky, 1987, 431). For Karbusicky, “thought in music occurs primarily in asemantical shapes and formulas” (433); any attempt to interpret these shapes and formulas through language or linguistic theory would ultimately fail to capture the substance of musical thought. Karbusicky was, however, willing to enter- tain the notion that there might be purely musical metaphors (as distinct from linguis- tic metaphors used to describe music). The example Karbusicky chose to illustrate this idea was inspired by a cabaret pianist who put together the melody of Robert Schu- mann’s “Tr¨aumerei” (from Kinderszenen op. 15, no. 7) with the melody of Antonin Dvoˇr´ak’s “Humoresque” in G-ﬂat major (op. 101 no. 7; here transposed to F major); see Example 3. (The title “humoresque” makes reference to a term used for lit- erary sketches by German writers during the early nineteenth century. Applied to musical works, it often indicates short occa- sional pieces with a relaxed – but not necessarily humorous – character.) The opening sections of both Schumann’s “Tr¨aumerei” and Dvoˇr´ak’s “Humoresque” are eight measures long, and for the most part Karbusicky’s example moves back and forth between the two pieces: measure 2 of Example 3 is measure 2 of the “Hu- moresque”; measures 3–4 of Example 3 are measures 3–4 of “Tr¨aumerei.” The excep- tion occurs in the second phrase (measures 5–9): while measure 5 replicates measure 5 of the “Humoresque” and measure 6 repli- cates measure 6 from “Tr¨aumerei,” measure 7 and the ﬁrst half of measure 8 are drawn from measures 6–7 of the “Humoresque.” This change results in an added measure, with the latter half of measure 8 and all of measure 9 of Example 3 drawn from measures 7–8 of “Tr¨aumerei.” This minor modiﬁcation notwithstanding, the free inter- changeability of musical materials evident in Example 3 is important for the point Karbusicky wishes to make, for it indicates basic structural similarities between the two melodies that supports their meaningful combination. A closer look at the music of Example 3 suggests that the materials of “Tr¨aumerei” – and the image of childhood dreaming that they are meant to evoke – control the musical discourse. These mate- rials frame the beginning and ending of the ﬁrst phrase (measures 1–4), and, in doing so,\n508 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI help to deﬁne its tonal structure. Although the “Humoresque” melody attempts to take control in the second phrase – shoving aside the reprise of the opening of “Tr¨aumerei” in measure 5, and running on for nearly two measures in measures 7–8 – the melody of “Tr¨aumerei” ultimately wins the day to con- clude the second phrase. In his analysis Karbusicky proposed that both melodies carry a basic semantic charge that might be described as “nostalgia, senti- ment” (keeping in mind that each melody projects this charge in a different way). Musical metaphor, as Karbusicky conceived it, comes about because the meaning of “Tr¨aumerei” is changed when the unfold- ing of its languid melody is interrupted by the sprightly gestures of the “Humoresque.” The resulting modiﬁcation of the senti- ment of “Tr¨aumerei” – pushing it toward cheerfulness – is a consequence of both the introduction of the contrasting seman- tic content of the “Humoresque” and the common structural features of the two melodies, a commonality that supports asso- ciating the sentiment of “Tr¨aumerei” with that of the “Humoresque” (Karbusicky, 1987, 436–437). The basic idea behind Karbusicky’s no- tion of purely musical metaphor, in which disparate musical materials are brought together to generate new meaning, can also be seen in Robert Hatten’s work on musical meaning (Hatten, 1994, chapter 7; 1995). Hatten, for his part, proposes that the correlations between musical materi- als and meaning must be established prior to their being brought together to create new meaning. This process occurs not in the manner of Karbusicky’s rather excep- tional example (which relies on structural similarities between the two melodies to support their combination) but instead takes advantage of what Hatten calls functional locations, which can be thought of as impor- tant structural moments within a musical work (such as the reprise of a signiﬁcant theme). A functional location may be a consequence of syntactic expectations set up within a particular piece, or may reﬂect stylistic formal schemas common to any number of pieces. When musical materials with markedly different meanings are subjected to the syntactic pressures that characterize such locations, new meaning emerges. Hatten’s general term for this pro- cess is musical troping – metaphor is just one type of musical trope that may result. (For a similar perspective, but framed relative to the work of Roman Jakobson and Jacques Derrida, see Ayrey, 1994.) As Hatten read- ily admits, his approach bears more in com- mon with poetic than with linguistic theory (Hatten, 2004, 297, n. 1); such a perspec- tive is well suited to the interpretive chal- lenges presented by the music of Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert on which Hatten has focused. Relationships between similar but struc- turally (or conceptually) distinct musical entities have long been recognized by musi- cians, although such relationships are of a sort closer to the pragmatic ones that under- lie Karbusicky’s analysis than they are to the poetic ones invoked by Hatten. Indeed, one could argue that teaching students how to identify and exploit such relationships is one of the cornerstones of music ped- agogy. It is perhaps for this very reason that the framework provided by theories of metaphor or analogy has not generally been used to characterize such relationships. When such frameworks have been applied to relationships among musical materials, it has been as part of a more comprehensive study of correlations between music and other media (Kielian-Gilbert, 1990) or to char- acterize how idealized musical constructs relate to actual musical practice (Dubiel, 1990, 327; Perlman, 2004, chaps. 6, 8). Again, the topic of metaphor more typi- cally crops up when the issue is how things that are musical relate to things that are not musical. Music and Other Aspects of Human Experience The issue of music’s connection with other aspects of human experience emerged with force in music scholarship in the period after World War II when, as a consequence\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 509 of developments in music composition begun a generation before and in keeping with the climate of aggressive positivism that informed a broad range of humanistic stud- ies, there arose the idea that the analysis of music could proceed along the lines of scientiﬁc inquiry (see, for instance, Babbitt, 1961/1972). The analyses produced would focus solely on matters of musical struc- ture, on the assumption that a comprehen- sive account of this structure would explain everything of importance about music. Mat- ters such as what music expressed would either be answered by such an account or regarded as beyond analysis. This per- spective was troubling to some; in 1960, Donald Ferguson proposed that “scientiﬁc” music theory, in fact, could not provide an adequate account of musical expression. As a corrective he offered a careful and thor- ough consideration of the basis of expres- sivity in music. Although the approach had much in common with that of Cooke (as dis- cussed in the appendix to Ferguson, 1960), Ferguson was adamant that expressivity in music had to be connected with human experience. It was because the expressive elements in music were connected to emo- tional experience that music could serve as a metaphor for the signiﬁcance of experi- ence (Ferguson, 1960, ix, 185). (For a sim- ilar perspective, but one more thoroughly grounded in semiotic theory and more systematically presented, see Coker, 1972, chapter 10.) Metaphor served as a powerful image for Ferguson but not as an explicit part of his response to analytical practices that ignored music’s expressivity. For Marion Guck, it was metaphor itself that suggested an alter- native to positivistic descriptions of musical structure. Early in her career Guck became interested in the communicative potential of metaphorical language about music, hav- ing noticed that some of her students pre- ferred such language over the formalistic accounts of musical structure that were commonly the focus of instruction in music analysis. Through a series of analytical exer- cises she and her students explored the use of such language and its relationship to traditional structuralist approaches. She con- cluded that metaphorical language could put students more directly in touch with those aspects of music upon which traditional ana- lytical techniques were focused, and add richness to their understanding of those aspects. If perceived musical structure is indivisi- ble from physical and emotional response, then metaphors may offer an embryonic structural interpretation reinforced by – explained through – physical-emotional responses. If a structural interpretation is not understood by itself, experiencing the responses may be another avenue to under- standing the structure. Equally, metaphors offer a physical-emotional experience rein- forced by – explained through – an embry- onic structural interpretation. (Guck, 1981, 42) Guck eventually came to argue that the whole of analytical discourse was rooted in metaphor (Guck, 1991), although she also strove to connect metaphorical discourse with the “scientiﬁc” approach adopted by many music analysts. She concluded that, while the claims for a scientiﬁc language about music could not be sustained, state- ments about music – whether such state- ments made use of explicit metaphors or whether they were restricted to less colorful technical descriptions – could be organized into consistent and coherent systems cor- related with intersubjectively apprehended musical events, and thus able to approach the methodology of scientiﬁc inquiry (Guck, 1994). Although the Anglo-American approach dominated research in music theory and analysis in the latter half of the twenti- eth century, scientism of the sort to which Ferguson and Guck (among many others) took exception never grabbed hold as ﬁrmly on the English side of the equation. When, in 1990, Nicholas Cook described music anal- ysis as metaphorical he was attempting to place it within the context of aesthetic and psychological approaches to music that he viewed not only as viable but as offering key insights into music as a cultural prod- uct. Analysis, from this perspective, is a way\n510 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI of imagining music – a metaphor for musi- cal experience rather than any sort of lit- eral record of that experience – much as for Scruton musical understanding itself was fundamentally imaginative (Cook, 1990, 10–43). As a whole, Anglo-American musicol- ogy (as distinct from music theory) was less in thrall to the scientiﬁc paradigm during the post–World War II period than were music theory and analysis (although some musicologists aspired to a commensurate positivism; see Kerman, 1985, chapter 2). On the rare occasion when metaphor rose to the surface of musicological inquiry it was in the context of an over-arching pattern of thought that shaped ideas about music. Thus Ruth Solie, in her study of melody, proposed to explore the metaphoric lan- guage used to characterize melody to better understand how earlier periods conceived melody. For example, if you are dealing with an “organic structure” or a “melodic curve” or a “universal language,” what sorts of behavior will you expect to observe from it, and therefore make note of? What charac- teristics will you perceive in “the embodied will to motion” that you might not see in a “pitch-time trajectory” or in a “stochas- tic process with sequential dependencies” – notwithstanding the fact that all three phrases refer to the same melody? (Solie, 1977, 9; see also Solie, 1980) Some 20 years later Bennett Zon used a similar approach in his exploration of con- ceptual models used by nineteenth-century British musicologists, but focused on the metaphorical templates provided by art, religion, and science. These templates pro- vided British musicologists with alternatives to straightforward chronological narratives; Herbert Spencer, for instance, writing in 1857, adopted the framework of evolution- ary theory to explain the development of music, and the colloquy that arose around this proposal had a signiﬁcant impact on the course taken by British musicology in the latter half of the nineteenth century (Zon, 2000, 120–125). Music, Metaphor, and Cognitive Science The perspective that guided Solie’s work, focusing as much on the language used to describe music as the music itself, was also one that came to prominence in the ﬁeld of ethnomusicology around the same time. Steven Feld, who had a long-standing inter- est in how language was used to describe music, noted this trend in a 1981 essay that also made an important contribution to the study of music and metaphor. Draw- ing on the work of Lakoff and Johnson (1980), David Rumelhart (1979/1993), and Robert Verbrugge (1979), Feld argued that the metaphorical descriptions used by the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea were a reﬂec- tion of key aspects of their everyday expe- rience. The Kaluli describe melodic inter- vals – whether in their own music or in the music of others – with the same terms they use to characterize features of waterfalls. For instance, in the language of the Kaluli sa means “waterfall,” and a mogan is a still or lightly swirling waterpool; sa-mogan is the ﬂow of a waterfall into a level waterpool beneath it. Sa-mogan is also used to describe a melodic line that descends to a repeated note, the contour of which replicates that of a waterfall ﬂowing into a pool (Feld, 1981, 30–31; see also Feld, 1982). The system of metaphorical relationships upon which such characterizations draw offers a rich descrip- tion of musical events, but one that also has its limitations: for example, the Kaluli do not have speciﬁc names for ascending intervals, which nonetheless do occur in their music. Feld’s work pointed toward a new approach to metaphor and music that was based on two important assumptions. The ﬁrst was that metaphor was not sim- ply a literary device but was instead a basic structure of understanding (Lakoff, 1993). The second was that music consti- tuted a conceptual domain that was, in some measure, independent of language. As a consequence of these two assumptions metaphorical descriptions of music came to be regarded as capable of providing key insights into how the understanding of music was structured. A notion closely associated\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 511 with the contemporary theory of metaphor, and that would prove important for music scholars, was that of an image schema (Johnson, 1987). Image schemas provided a theoretical basis for metaphorical descrip- tions of music grounded in embodied expe- rience, an approach that ﬁt with many ana- lysts’ intuitions about the nature of musi- cal knowledge and that offered a way to move beyond – or add another dimension to – the abstract formalisms prominent in much music-theoretical work. Subsequent to a special session at the 1996 annual meet- ing of the Society for Music Theory, an issue of the journal Theory and Practice was given over to connections between music the- ory and embodied knowledge, and included articles by Janna Saslaw on force dynam- ics in the theoretical writings of Heinrich Schenker and Arnold Schoenberg (Saslaw, 1997–1998), Candace Brower on embodied schemas in Edgard Var`ese’s Density 21.5 for solo ﬂute (Brower, 1997–1998), and Steve Larson on how the understanding of tonal melodies is shaped by experience with the forces of gravity, magnetism, and inertia (Larson, 1997–1998). The cognitive perspective on metaphor and music was, in some instances, part of a broader perspective on the cognitive capacities that shape humans’ understand- ing of music (Spitzer, 2004; Zbikowski, 1991, 1998, 2002) but was often employed in one of two more restricted ways. First, metaphor theory was brought to bear on recognized but not clearly understood con- ceptual models within music theory, includ- ing those pertaining to musical invari- ance (Saslaw & Walsh, 1996), modulation theory (Saslaw, 1996), hierarchical struc- tures in music (Zbikowski, 1997), and historical conceptions of tonal organiza- tion (Gur, 2008). Second, metaphor the- ory provided a way into novel reperto- ries, including heavy metal (Walser, 1991), musical multimedia (Cook, 1998, chap- ter 3), the music of the Grateful Dead (O’Donnell, 1999), the music of Neil Young (Echard, 1999, 2005, chapter 4), Javanese Gamelan (Perlman, 2004, chapter 6), and ﬁlm music (Chattah, 2006). Recent research on metaphor and music that embodies a cognitive perspective has coalesced around a somewhat broader set of issues, in many cases offering alternatives to previous approaches. Prominent here is work on musical meaning that takes as its starting point the assumption that mean- ing is grounded in embodied experience (Aksnes, 2002; Borgo, 2004; Chuck, 2004; Cox, 2001; Johnson, 1997–1998; Walker, 2000); an account of the ontology of the musical work framed around the metaphor- ical notion of a musical object (Butterﬁeld, 2002); and explorations of the bases for and applications of ideas about musical motion and musical space (Adlington, 2003; Cox, 1999; Johnson & Larson, 2003; Johnson, 2007, chapter 11; Spitzer, 2003). The broad-based approach advocated by Zbikowski (2002, chapter 2), which adopts a generalized view of metaphor as a kind of cross-domain mapping and pro- poses that music represents a conceptual domain that can be drawn into such map- pings, has recently been extended to cor- relations between patterns in Azerbaijani carpet weaving and musical practice (Nar- oditskaya, 2005) and to theoretical work on conceptual blending and music. Prelim- inary work on conceptual blends in which music occupies one of the input spaces was focused on the possibilities for mean- ing construction created by the correlation of text and music in nineteenth-century art songs (Zbikowski, 1999, 2002, chapter 6) but has since been applied to analyses of the nature of musical meaning (Cook, 2001), analyses of ﬁlm music, opera, and musical multimedia (Johnson, 2004; Sayrs, 2003; Zbikowski, 2002–2003), the analysis of Gy¨orgy Ligeti’s Lontano (Bauer, 2004), the role of the arabesque in the music of Ravel (Bhogal, 2007), and to the construc- tion of musical meaning as a whole (Chuck, 2004). Although most applications of the con- temporary theory of metaphor to music have been broadly theoretical, recent empirical studies by Zohar Eitan and his colleagues have begun to show in greater detail how metaphor structures our understanding of\n512 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI music (Eitan & Granot, 2006), and how the metaphors used to characterize musical rela- tionships reﬂect the inﬂuence of culuture (Eitan & Timmers, 2006). These studies sug- gest not only ways to study how metaphor structures our understanding of music, but also ways to investigate how metaphor- ical processes operate in nonlinguistic domains. Metaphor and the Analysis of Music Although the preceding section provided a historical and conceptual context for the questions asked at the opening of this chap- ter, it did not provide a methodology for answering these questions. The purpose of this section is to present such a methodology, which takes as its point of departure the con- temporary theory of metaphor (as character- ized by Lakoff, 1993) and the compositional technique of text painting. The basic idea of text painting is simple enough. When a particularly strong or com- pelling image occurs in the text for a musical work, the composer writes the accompany- ing music to suggest, or “paint,” the image. Thus, if the text mentions a galloping horse, the music coincident with the text might imitate the sound and action of a horse pro- ceeding at full speed. While there are lim- its to what can be represented in this way, composers have found the means to por- tray descents from heaven, rippling streams, spinning wheels, physical trembling, sexual climax, and a host of other vibrant images (Macy, 1996; Zbikowski, 2002, chapter 2). The example of text painting I want to consider here involves the portrayal of the act of knocking on a door. It comes to the fore near the beginning of the move- ment that provided the music for Example 1, which was from Bach’s Advent cantata “Nun komm der Heiden Heiland” (BWV 61). Each of the three preceding movements of the cantata explores an aspect of the Advent theme. The ﬁrst movement is an overture whose text is taken from a chorale by Martin Luther: “Come now, Savior of the gentiles, known to be the child of a Virgin, the whole world marvels that God should have ordained such a birth for Him.” The text for the second-movement recita- tive is by the Hamburg poet, theologian, and pastor Erdmann Neumeister and speaks of the wonder of God made incarnate. The third movement, an aria with a text also by Neumeister, returns to the summons stated by the overture: “Come, Jesu, come to Thy church and grant a blessed New Year!” But with the fourth movement Christ is sud- denly before us, speaking words from the third chapter of Revelation: “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock. If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” Bach sets this passage as an accompanied recitative for baritone, with the strings playing pizzicato throughout; the score for the entire movement is given in Example 4. Bach’s text painting is centered on the words “und klopfe an” – that is, “and knock.” Bach uses three compositional techniques to paint this activity. First, he summons the repetitions we associate with the act of knocking by repeating the words, and by using three notes to set the ﬁrst sylla- ble of the initial “klopfe” (a device called a melisma). Second, he uses staccato marks on the three notes of the melisma, which place silences between these notes; these silences are similar to those that fall between knocks on a door. Third, he sets the words with a broken chord (or arpeggio). This places a kind of distance between each successive note but also allows us to hear all as belong- ing to a single connected gesture. The conventional explanation for why text painting works relies on the idea of mimesis: the image of knocking is sum- moned by Bach’s setting of “und klopfe an” because the music imitates the sound of knocking. While this is partially true for Bach’s text painting, there are certain things that are not quite right. Knocks are usually unpitched, but Bach gives us different pitches for each blow; knocking is not usually accompanied, but here we have pizzicato strings pulsing in the back- ground. A few writers have gone so far as to\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 513 =54 =54 Violin I Violin II Viola Viola Violoncello Bass pizz. pizz. pizz. pizz. pizz.

Not only are the attack points too widely spaced to sound much like knock- ing but the effect is far too persistent, more like Edgar Allen Poe’s telltale heart than a summons from the Savior.\n514 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI 7 dem wer de - ich ein ge - hen - und das Ab end - mahl - mit ihm hal ten, - und 9 er mit mir. Example 4. (cont.) In fact, text painting is not a matter of simple mimesis, in which music, through its resemblance to a natural sound, represents that sound, but of a more complex process through which music represents the image- schematic structure of some event or situ- ation. This sort of representation is some- what like the iconicity of rhetorical ﬁgures discussed by Mark Turner (1998). Turner noted that the form of a rhetorical ﬁgure\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 515 is sometimes matched to the meaning the speaker wishes to convey, connecting the image-schematic structure of the form with the image-schematic structure of the mean- ing. Thus, a rhetorical ﬁgure based on rep- etition, such as anaphora (which involves the repetition of the same word or group of words at the beginning of successive clauses, sentences, or lines), can be used to summon the image of repeated blows, as in an exam- ple attributed to Longinus: “By his man- ner, his looks, his voice, when he strikes you with insult, when he strikes you like an enemy, when he strikes you with his knuck- les, when he strikes you like a slave.” The efﬁcacy of such a connection is straightfor- ward enough – Turner remarks, “Involving members of the audience in the image schema of the iconic form automatically involves them in the basic structure of the meaning, thus moving them part way toward accepting the whole” (1998, 50–51). In a similar way, Bach’s recitative embodies the image-schematic structure of the act of knocking at the very moment when knock- ing is mentioned in the text. Bach’s music thus moves the listener part of the way toward understanding the force of Christ’s act of knocking: where previous movements in the cantata have summoned Christ, Christ is now summoning us. More generally, the connection of music to text in instances such as this relies on structural correlations between the two domains. The speciﬁc correlations are between image-schematic structures. In the present example, the text calls up the famil- iar situation of a person standing before a door with the intent of communicating with people on the other side of the door. A scene of this sort typically involves knock- ing on the door to establish communication; knocking, in turn, is accomplished through a series of regularly spaced physical gestures that yield a sequence of unpitched sounds of short duration. The conceptual domain set up by the text thus includes the image- schematic structure associated with the act of knocking. The bass melody in the opening measures of this movement does not sum- mon anything as speciﬁc as does the text, but it nonetheless participates in establish- ing a conceptual domain structured in part by image schemata. Features of this con- ceptual domain include the steadily puls- ing strings which contrast with the ﬂowing melody of the bass voice, the dissonances that occur against the pedal E3 in the accom- paniment, and the E minor tonality that is projected. The projection of any tonality is a process that unfolds over time – an impor- tant part of that process in the case at hand is the bass melody, which is restricted to just those pitches that are necessary for deﬁn- ing E minor. In the course of this melody the distinctive melodic gesture that occupies the beginning of measure 3 stands out: it intro- duces the largest leap thus far (the minor seventh from D3 to C4), the only melisma, and concludes with another minor-seventh leap (A3 to B2). The passage ends with the shortest notated durations of the passage (the sixteenth notes at the end of measure 3) which serve to further set this measure off from the rest. The image-schematic struc- ture that is relevant here is of a series of dis- crete events that are evenly spaced and that stand out from their surroundings; this then correlates with the image-schematic struc- ture of the conceptual domain set up by the words to produce an instance of text paint- ing. One question raised by this example is whether the connection between the image- schematic structure of knocking and the image-schematic structure of this musical passage is necessary. The answer is a qualiﬁed “no.” It might indeed be possible, without the text, to make a connection between the act of knocking and the music of measure 3. There is enough urgency in the music Bach writes – an urgency that includes both the more rapid durations at the end of the mea- sure and the much smaller registral space they inhabit (contracting from C4 to B2 in the ﬁrst part of the measure to F♯3 to B4 at its end) – that knocking seems a fairly good description for the music. But the music could be described in other ways as well: the whole of the melody in these opening measures could be characterized in terms of the imagined movements of an actor on a\n516 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI stage who, after a series of relatively con- strained gestures (in measures 1–2), suddenly gestures in an exaggerated, expansive way (at the beginning of measure 3) before cor- recting her excess at the end of the passage. This characterization would draw on the metaphor of musical “space” (and its atten- dant image-schematic structure) and tend to emphasize the way the pitches of the melody are disposed within this space more than their rhythmic features. The charac- terization would also provide a perspective that encompasses the whole of the passage rather than focusing on measure 3. The con- text provided by the text from Revelations is thus key to hearing the music of measure 3 as a representation of knocking and not as a representation of something else. There are, nonetheless, limits to how the passage can be characterized – were someone to describe the passage as an energetic portrayal of religious bliss we would wonder if they had listened to the same music as we had, since there is almost nothing in the musical events of measures 1–4 – or the image-schematic structures through which we might orga- nize our understanding of these events – that would support such a characterization. Another important factor that shapes cor- relations between music and other domains is cultural knowledge. Describing musical pitches in terms of their disposition in space (with one pitch “higher” or “lower” than another) has been a commonplace in west- ern traditions since at least the Middle Ages (Cox, 1999; Duchez, 1979; Zbikowski, 2002, chapter 2). Other descriptions are, how- ever, possible: in Bali and Java, for instance, pitches are conceived of not as “high” and “low” but as “small” and “large” (Zanten, 1986, 85), a conception that reﬂects accu- rately the norms of acoustic production – small things typically vibrate more rapidly than large things. Thus we would not expect members of a culture that did not practice knocking as a way of announcing an arrival or the initiation of communication to make the connection between the music of measure 3 and the words “und klopfe an” (translated, of course, into the appropriate language for communication). Text painting is, admittedly, a some- what rariﬁed compositional technique. It nonetheless points to the basis for metaphor- ical descriptions of music and gives some sense of how the conceptual domain of music might participate in metaphorical mappings. When we describe a musical pas- sage as “obstinately plodding” or a chord as “sour and biting” we are making connec- tions between one domain of experience (having to do with the ways bodies can move through space, the sense of taste, or the physical actions accomplished by teeth) and the domain of music. The domain of music includes various musical events as well as ways of understanding their rela- tionships to one another; these relationships are in part structured by image schemata. Just how this is accomplished is still being explored empirically, but one of the best the- oretical accounts is provided by Lawrence Barsalou’s theory of perceptual symbol sys- tems (Barsalou, 1999). According to this theory, sequences of musical events pro- duce brain maps that can be correlated with brain maps produced by other modalities (including vision, taste, and proprioception); these correlations then operate as symbols to form the basis for conceptual knowl- edge. The array of perceptual symbols (or image schemata) that may be used to structure a given relationship is potentially quite extensive; cultural knowledge pro- vides one constraint on which structures are chosen. The notion of music as an indepen- dent domain with its own properties and relationships – properties and relationships that language attempts to capture through metaphorical descriptions – invites two extensions of the discussion of metaphor and music. First, mappings within music (of the sort discussed in Karbusicky, 1987; Kielian- Gilbert, 1990; Perlman, 2004) are a logical entailment of this perspective, and a straight- forward example of such a mapping would be between a theme and variations derived from the theme. (For a rich consideration of this topic see Cone, 1987.) These map- pings may, however, be closer to those of analogy (and emphasize the alignment of\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 517 Example 5. Basic conceptual integration network for Bach’s text painting of “und klopfe an.” structural features) than to metaphor (with its emphasis on the construction of mean- ing through the correlation of rich networks of knowledge; cf. Gentner, Bowdle, Wolff, & Boronat, 2001). Second, concepts from the musical domain may combine with concepts from another conceptual domain to create a conceptual blend (Fauconnier & Turner, this volume). Two interconnected examples of conceptual blends are provided by the music of Example 4. The ﬁrst blend is produced by the text painting that occurs in measure 3; a dia- gram of the conceptual integration network for the blend is shown in Example 5. The generic space for the blend focuses on phys- ical aspects of the act of knocking: the repeated actions that make up knocking, the sharp disjunction between sound and silence that results, and the way knocking breaks into our attention. The text space is set up by the semantic associations generated by the words “und klopfe an,” which not only bring the physical act to mind but also its typical context: a summons of some sort (if only to come to the door and open it). The music space is set up by Bach’s text painting: his repetitions of “und klopfe an,” the melisma with staccato articulation, and the arpeg- gio that provides a contextual frame for the notes that set the words. In the blend, musi- cal and linguistic concepts combine to pro- vide a musical representation of someone knocking on a door. There is more, of course, to the passage from the third chapter of Revelation than\n518 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI simply a description of someone knocking on a door. The image is central to the sum- mons with which this fragment is concerned: Christ is calling us to his church. A simple, everyday act is thus made to resonate with a much more profound meaning: answering this summons is but the beginning of a chain of entailments with profound consequences for all who are concerned. A glimpse at one manifestation of this chain of entailments is provided by a second conceptual blend, which is set up over the course of the move- ment as a whole. As noted in my discussion of the ﬁrst four measures of the movement, Bach makes use of some striking dissonances in the process of establishing E minor. These dissonances – which involve the dominant-seventh and leading-tone chords of E minor – resolve at measure 4, coincident with the second iter- ation of “und klopfe an.” Christ’s knocking thus has a real and audible effect on the music. After the arrival on E minor in measure 4 the bass pedal is abandoned, and the music moves toward G major, which ﬁrst appears in measures 6 and 7 and then is conﬁrmed with the ﬁnal cadence in measure 10. The move toward G major is accompanied by a change in the vocal writing, which becomes more lyrical. By the end of this short move- ment we understand that the opening por- tion, with its obstinate pedal tone and disso- nant harmonies, is meant to lead toward this denouement – it is something we have to leave in order to get to the safe haven of the ﬁnal cadence. This journey is in fact prepared by Bach’s text painting, for it is the musical materials associated with the setting of “und klopfe an” that push us away from the static and dissonant opening materials toward the progress and consonance represented by the G major music. Just as the image of knock- ing is crucial for the larger story told by the text, the musical representation of knock- ing is crucial for the larger story told by the music. This leads us to the conceptual blend shown in Example 6, which takes in the whole of the movement. The generic space for the blend focuses on the notion of redemption. Within the general context of an Advent cantata, redemption is naturally associated with the act of freeing the believer from the consequences of sin. Within the more speciﬁc context of the Pietism that inﬂuenced Bach’s interpretation of the text, redemption means something closer to its etymological roots – that is, to buy some- thing back – and thus requires something of the believer as well. The text space pro- vides the basic elements of the story of redemption: Christ knocking at the door; the believer opening the door; and the act of redemption itself, symbolized by Christ’s entrance and the shared meal. Within the music space we get nothing quite as precise as this – indeed, the musical events could be mapped onto a variety of stories or sit- uations – but we do get a tightly organized sequence of events. This sequence involves a number of musical elements and connects with some of our ideas about redemption, including movement from a static and dis- sonant situation into a progressive and con- sonant one. In the blend, the narrative from the passage out of Revelation is compressed with syntactic processes proper to music. We begin in a static, dissonant environment with Christ announcing himself and then knock- ing at the door. This knock is a summons to redemption, and the dissonant environ- ment starts to become more consonant. By the time the opening of the door is men- tioned (in measure 6, with the words “und die T¨ur auftun”) we have entered the orbit of G major, and the remainder of the move- ment ﬁlls out the theme of redemption and afﬁrms G major, with one important excep- tion. With the singer’s very last word (“mir,” in measure 9), Bach returns momentarily to E minor, a move that casts a shadow over the scene and seems to suggest the sacriﬁces that redemption requires. Although there is little doubt of the promise of redemption at the conclusion of the movement, the musical syntax through which the story is told points to the struggles that are required to achieve redemption. Tonal closure is not assured, but must be won; redemption requires\nMETAPHOR AND MUSIC 519 Example 6. Conceptual integration network for the fourth movement from J. S. Bach’s cantata “Nun komm der Heiden Heiland.” more than simply opening the door to the Savior. Conclusion Music is a rich and complex product of cul- ture – the brief examples discussed here include music that is part of the ritual of religious service (Bach’s cantata), music with a programmatic title (Schumann’s “Tr¨aumerei”), light instrumental music for diversion (Dvoˇr´ak’s “Humoresque”), and even music for the cabaret (which inspired Karbusicky’s example). These possibilities barely scratch the surface of musical expres- sion, which is manifested in all known human cultures; includes music for ritual, dance, song, diversion, and a multitude of other activities; and touches on the complete range of human emotion. The cultural prac- tice of music is also largely non-linguistic and non-referential, although both language and reference can play a role in musical practice. Given the range of musical expres- sion and its independence from language, it is not surprising that language about music is often metaphorical, nor that the topic of metaphor and music has been touched on by a wide range of scholarly disciplines. Michael Tomasello (1999, chapter 5) recently proposed that one of the pri- mary functions of language is to manipu- late the attention of another person within\n520 LAWRENCE M. ZBIKOWSKI a shared referential frame. It could be argued that one of the primary functions of music is to manipulate the emotions of others. Although this argument is hardly new (see, for instance, Meyer, 1956), it has often been advanced within the relatively narrow context of instrumental music pro- duced in western Europe during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The argument could easily be broadened through the recognition that music can also manipu- late the emotions through the way it shapes ritual, dance, and the rendering of a text. If it is that case that language and music have dif- ferent functions within human culture – that they comprise different domains of expe- rience – it follows that mappings between these domains would yield numerous possi- bilities for the sort of meaning construction associated with metaphor. According to current theory, mappings between language and music rely on image- schematic structures that are common to the two domains. Music will tend to instantiate such structures dynamically, while language will call them up through reference. When music summons knocking in the fourth movement of Bach’s “Nun komm der Heiden Heiland” it does so by replicating features of the act of knock- ing. The text, by contrast, simply refers to the act, relying on the listener to call up the dynamic schema once the referen- tial frame has been activated. Combinations of music and text such as those created through the compositional technique of text painting thus represent a kind of laboratory for the study of image-schematic structure. Any schema thought to underlie mappings between the two domains will have to be represented in each, and the two different modes of activating schemas – dynamically, and through reference – will give further indications of their relevant properties. Music, as an expressive medium dis- tinct from that of language, can also offer interesting possibilities for thinking about metaphorical processes. More purely “musi- cal” mappings, such as those between a theme and variation, appear to be closer to analogy. Similar relationships between sonic patterns can also be seen in prose and, more typically, metered poetry, sug- gesting an exploration of these instances in terms of analogy as well as metaphor. The participation of music in conceptual integration networks, such as the two dis- cussed in connection with the movement from Bach’s cantata, offers possibilities for meaning construction that blends concepts from music and other domains. Conceptual blends that involve music and some other domain also provide an opportunity to study the structural features of each domain, given the assumption that blends require a uni- form topography between the mental spaces involved in the conceptual integration net- work. The question that has often been posed is, “Is music a language?” The composer David Lidov (2005) proposed reversing the terms with his question, “Is language a music?” The exploration of metaphor and music has much to say to both questions, as well as to the constituent features of both of these uniquely human modes of expression.

Metaphorical Coherence vii\nISBN 0-226-46801-1 Preface This book grew out of a concern, on both our parts, with how people understand their language and their experience. When we first met, in early January 1979, we found that we shared, also, a sense that the dominant views on meaning in Western philosophy and linguistics are inadequate—that \"meaning\" in these traditions has very little to do with what people find ineaningfrrl in their lives. We were brought together by a joint interest in metaphor. Mark had found that most traditional philosophical views permit metaphor little, if any, role in understanding our world and ourselves. George had discovered linguistic evidence showing that metaphor is pervasive in everyday language and thought—evidence that did not fit any contemporary Anglo-American theory of meaning within either linguistics or philosophy. Metaphor has traditionally been viewed in both fields as a matter of peripheral interest. We shared the intuition that it is, instead, a matter of central concern, perhaps the key to giving an adequate account of understanding. Shortly after we met, we decided to collaborate on what we thought would be a brief paper giving some linguistic evidence to point up shortcomings in recent theories of meaning. Within a week we discovered that certain assumptions of contemporary philosophy and linguistics that have been taken for granted within the Western tradition since the Greeks precluded us from even raising the kind of issues we wanted to address. The problem was not one of extending or patching up some existing theory of meaning ((ix)) ((x)) but of revising central assumptions in the Western philosophical tradition. In particular, this meant rejecting the possibility of any objective or absolute truth and a host of related assumptions. It also meant supplying an alternative account in which human experience and understanding, rather than objective truth, played the central role. In the process, we have worked out elements of an experientialist approach, not only to issues of language, truth, and under-standing but to questions about the meaningfulness of our everyday experience. Berkeley, California July 1, 1979((\n((Xi)) Acknowledgments Ideas don't come out of thin air. The general ideas in this book represent a synthesis of various intellectual traditions and show the influence of our teachers, colleagues, stu-dents, and friends. In addition, many specific ideas have come from discussions with literally hundreds of people. We cannot adequately acknowledge all of the traditions and people to whom we are indebted. All we can do is to list some of them and hope that the rest will know who they are and that we appreciate them. The following are among the sources of our general ideas. John Robert Ross and Ted Cohen have shaped our ideas about linguistics, philosophy, and life in a great many ways. Pete Becker and Charlotte Linde have given us an appreciation for the way people create coherence in their lives. Charles Fillmore's work on frame semantics, Terry Winograd's ideas about knowledge- representation systems, and Roger Schank's conception of scripts provided the basis for George's original conception of linguistic gestalts, which we have generalized to experiential gestalts. Our views about family resemblances, the prototype theory of categorization, and fuzziness in categorization come from Ludwig Wittgenstein, Eleanor Rosch, Lotfi Zadeh, and Joseph Goguen. Our observations about how a language can reflect the conceptual system of its speakers derive in great part from the work of Edward Sapir, Benjamin Lee Whorf, and others who have worked in that tradition. Our ideas about the relationship between metaphor and ritual derive from the anthropological tradition of Bronislaw ((xii)) Malinowski, Claude Levi-Strauss, Victor Turner, Clifford Geertz, and others. Our ideas about the way our conceptual system is shaped by our constant successful functioning in the physical and cultural environment come partly from the tradition of re- search in human development begun by Jean Piaget and partly from the tradition in ecological psychology growing out of the work of J. J. Gibson and James Jenkins, particu- larly as represented in the work of Robert Shaw, Michael Turvey, and others. Our views about the nature of the human sciences have been significantly influenced by Paul Ricoeur, Robert McCauley, and the Continental tradition in philosophy.\nSandra McMorris Johnson, James Melchert, Newton and Helen Harrison, and David and Ellie Antin have enabled us to see the common thread in aesthetic experience and other aspects of our experience. Don Arbitblit has focused our attention on the political and economic implications of our ideas. Y. C. Chiang has allowed us to see the relationship between bodily experience and modes of viewing oneself and the world. We also owe a very important debt to those contemporary figures who have worked out in great detail the philosophical ideas we are reacting against. We respect the work of Richard Montague, Saul Kripke, David Lewis, Donald Davidson, and others as important contributions to the traditional Western conceptions of meaning and truth. It is their clarification of these traditional philosophical concepts that has enabled us to see where we diverge from the tradi-tion and where we preserve elements of it. Our claims rest largely on the evidence of linguistic examples. Many if not most of these have come out of discussions with colleagues, students, and friends. John Robert Ross, in particular, has provided a steady stream of examples via phone calls and postcards. The bulk of the examples in chapters 16 and 17 came from Claudia Brug-man, who also gave us invaluable assistance in the prepara- lion of the manuscript. Other examples have come from )on Arbitblit, George Bergman, Dwight Bolinger, Ann Iiorkin, Matthew Bronson, Clifford Hill, D. K. Houlgate Ill, Dennis Love, Tom Mandel, John Manley-Buser, Monica Macauley, James D. McCawley, William Nagy, Reza Nilipoor, Geoff Nunberg, Margaret Rader, Michael Reddy, Ron Silliman, Eve Sweetser, Marta Tobey, Karl Zimmer, as well as various students at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the San Francisco Art Institute. Many of the individual ideas in this work have emerged from informal discussions. We would particularly like to thank Jay Atlas, Paul Bennaceraf, Betsy Brandt, Dick Brooks, Eve Clark, Herb Clark, J. W. Coffman, Alan Rundes, Glenn Erickson, Charles Fillmore, James Geiser, Leanne Hinton, Paul Kay, Les Lamport, David Lewis, George McClure, George Rand, John Searle, Dan Slobin, Steve Tainer, Len Talmy, Elizabeth Warren, and Bob Wilensky. ((3))\n1. Concepts We Live By Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish—a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphor is typieully viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor. We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action. Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature. The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to the most mundane details. Our concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities. If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we experience, and what we do every day is very much a matter of metaphor. But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of. In most of the little things we do every day, we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines. Just what these lines are is by no means obvious. One way to find out is by looking at language. Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting, language is an important source of evidence for what that system is like. ((4)) Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence, we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature. And we have found a way to begin to identify in detail just what the metaphors are that structure how we perceive, how we think, and what we do. To give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such a concept to structure an everyday activity, let us start with the concept ARGUMENT and the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety of expressions:\nARGUMENT IS WAR Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. His criticisms were right on target. I demolished his argument. I've never won an argument with him. You disagree? Okay, shoot! If you use that strategy, he'll wipe you out. He shot down all of my arguments. It is important to see that we don't just talk about arguments in terms of war. We can actually win or lose arguments. We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent. We attack his positions and we defend our own. We gain and lose ground. We plan and use strategies. If we find a position indefensible, we can abandon it and take a new line of attack. Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war. Though there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle, and the structure of an argument—attack, defense, counterattack, etc.—reflects this. It is in this sense that the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor is one that we live by in this culture; it structures the actions we perform in arguing. Try to imagine a culture where arguments are not viewed in terms of war, where no one wins or loses, where there is no sense of attacking or defending, gaining or losing ((5)) ground. Imagine a culture where an argument is viewed as a dance, the participants are seen as performers, and the goal is to perform in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing way. In such a culture, people would view arguments differently, experience them differently, carry them out differently, and talk about them differently. But we would prob- ably not view them as arguing at all: they would simply be doing something different. It would seem strange even to call what they were doing \"arguing.\" Perhaps the most neutral way of describing this difference between their culture and ours would be to say that we have a discourse form structured in terms of battle and they have one structured in terms of dance. This is an example of what it means for a metaphorical concept, namely, ARGUMENT IS WAR, to structure (at least in part) what we do and how we understand what we are doing when we argue. The essence of metaphor is under-standing and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another. It is not that arguments are a subspecies of war. Arguments and wars are different kinds of things—verbal discourse and armed conflict—and the actions performed are different kinds of actions. But ARGUMENT is partially structured, understood, performed, and talked about in terms of WAR. The concept is metaphorically structured, the activity is metaphorically structured, and, consequently, the language is metaphorically structured. Moreover, this is the ordinary way of having an argument and talking about one. The normal way for us to talk about attacking a position is to use the words \"attack a position.\" Our conventional ways of talking about arguments pre-suppose a metaphor we are hardly ever conscious of. The metaphor is not merely in the words we use—it is in our very concept of an argument. The language of argument is not poetic, fanciful, or rhetorical; it\nis literal. We talk about arguments that way because we conceive of them that way—and we act according to the way we conceive of things. ((6)) The most important claim we have made so far is that metaphor is not just a matter of language, that is, of mere words. We shall argue that, on the contrary, human thought processes are largely metaphorical. This is what we mean when we say that the human conceptual system is metaphorically structured and defined. Metaphors as linguistic expressions are possible precisely because there are metaphors in a person's conceptual system. Therefore, whenever in this book we speak of metaphors, such as ARGUMENT IS WAR, it should be understood that metaphor means metaphorical concept. ((7))\n2. The Systematicity of Metaphorical Concepts Arguments usually follow patterns; that is, there are certain things we typically do and do not do in arguing. The fact Iliac we in part conceptualize arguments in terms of battle Mystematically influences the shape arguments take and the way we talk about what we do in arguing. Because the metaphorical concept is systematic, the language we use to talk about that aspect of the concept is systematic. We saw in the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor that expressions from the vocabulary of war, e.g., attack a position, indefensible, strategy, new line of attack, win, gain ground, etc., form a systematic way of talking about the battling aspects of arguing. It is no accident that these expressions mean what they mean when we use them to talk about arguments. A portion of the conceptual network of battle partially characterizes the concept of an argument, and the language follows suit. Since metaphorical expressions in our language are tied to metaphorical concepts in a systematic way, we can use metaphorical linguistic expressions to study the nature of metaphorical concepts and to gain an understanding of the metaphorical nature of our activities. To get an idea of how metaphorical expressions in every-day language can give us insight into the metaphorical na-ture of the concepts that structure our everyday activities, let us consider the metaphorical concept TIME IS MONEY as it is reflected in contemporary English. TIME IS MONEY You're wasting my time. This gadget will save you hours. ((8)) I don't have the time to give you. How do you spend your time these days? That flat tire cost me an hour. I've invested a lot of time in her. I don't have enough time to spare for that. You're running out of time. You need to budget your time. Put aside some time for ping pong. Is that worth your while? Do you have much time left? He's living on borrowed time. You don't use your time profitably. I lost a lot of time when I got sick. Thank you for your time. Time in our culture is a valuable commodity. It is a limited resource that we use to accomplish our goals. Because of the way that the concept of work has developed in mod- ern Western culture, where work is typically associated with the time it takes and time is\nprecisely quantified, it has become customary to pay people by the hour, week, or year. In our culture TIME IS MONEY in many ways: tele-phone message units, hourly wages, hotel room rates, yearly budgets, interest on loans, and paying your debt to society by \"serving time.\" These practices are relatively new in the history of the human race, and by no means do they exist in all cultures. They have arisen in modern industrialized societies and structure our basic everyday activities in a very profound way. Corresponding to the fact that we act as if time is a valuable commodity—a limited resource, even money—we conceive of time that way. Thus we understand and experience time as the kind of thing that can be spent, wasted, budgeted, invested wisely or poorly, saved, or squandered. TIME IS MONEY, TIME IS A LIMITED RESOURCE, and TIME IS A VALUABLE COMMODITY are all metaphorical concepts. They are metaphorical since we are using our everyday experiences with money, limited resources, and valuable ((9)) •lttmnodities to conceptualize time. This isn't a necessary Why for human beings to conceptualize time; it is tied to our vtllture. There are cultures where time is none of these things. The metaphorical concepts TIME IS MONEY, TIME IS A Nlfsot)CE, and TIME IS A VALUABLE COMMODITY form a Mingle system based on subcategorization, since in our soci-Mly money is a limited resource and limited resources are Valuable commodities. These subcategorization relation-Nhlps characterize entailment relationships between the Metaphors. TIME IS MONEY entails that TIME IS A LIMITED tltl5OURCE, which entails that TIME IS A VALUABLE COMMOUITY. We are adopting the practice of using the most specific Metaphorical concept, in this case TIME IS MONEY, to characterize the entire system. Of the expressions listed tinder the TIME IS MONEY metaphor, some refer specifically to money (spend, invest, budget, profitably, cost), others to limited resources (use, use up, have enough of, run out of), and still others to valuable commodities (have, give, lose, /hank you for). This is an example of the way in which metaphorical entailments can characterize a coherent system of metaphorical concepts and a corresponding coherent system of metaphorical expressions for those concepts. ((10))\n3. Metaphorical Systematicity: Highlighting and Hiding The very systematicity that allows us to comprehend one aspect of a concept in terms of another (e.g., comprehend-ing an aspect of arguing in terms of battle) will necessarily hide other aspects of the concept. In allowing us to focus on one aspect of a concept (e.g., the battling aspects of arguing), a metaphorical concept can keep us from focusing on other aspects of the concept that are inconsistent with that metaphor. For example, in the midst of a heated argument, when we are intent on attacking our opponent's position and defending our own, we may lose sight of the cooperative aspects of arguing. Someone who is arguing with you can be viewed as giving you his time, a valuable commodity, in an effort at mutual understanding. But when we are preoccupied with the battle aspects, we often lose sight of the cooperative aspects. A far more subtle case of how a metaphorical concept can hide an aspect of our experience can be seen in what Michael Reddy has called the \"conduit metaphor.\" Reddy observes that our language about language is structured roughly by the following complex metaphor: IDEAS (Or MEANINGS) ARE OBJECTS. LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS. COMMUNICATION IS SENDING. The speaker puts ideas (objects) into words (containers) and sends them (along a conduit) to a hearer who takes the idea/objects out of the word/containers. Reddy documents this with more than a hundred types of expressions in English, which he estimates account for at least 70 percent of ((10)) HIGHLIGHTING AND HIDING the expressions we use for talking about language. Here are some examples: The CONDUIT Metaphor It's hard to get that idea across to him. I gave you that idea. Your reasons came through to us. It's difficult to put my ideas into words. When you have a good idea, try to capture it immediately in words. Try to pack more thought into fewer words. You can't simply stuff ideas into a sentence any old way. The meaning is right there in the words. Don't force your meanings into the wrong words. His words carry little meaning. The introduction has a great deal of thought content. Your words seem hollow. The sentence is without meaning. The idea is buried in terribly dense paragraphs. In examples like these it is far more difficult to see that there is anything hidden by the metaphor or even to see that there is a metaphor here at all. This is so much the con- ventional way of thinking about language that it is some-times hard to imagine that it\nmight not fit reality. But if we look at what the CONDUIT metaphor entails, we can see some of the ways in which it masks aspects of the communieative process. First, the LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS FOR MEANINGS aspect of the CONDUIT metaphor entails that words and sentences have meanings in themselves, in-dependent of any context or speaker. The MEANINGS ARE OBJECTS part of the metaphor, for example, entails that meanings have an existence independent of people and con-texts. The part of the metaphor that says LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS FOR MEANING entails that words (and sentences) have meanings, again independent of contexts and speakers. These metaphors are appropriate in many situations—those where context differences don't ((12)) matter and where all the participants in the conversation understand the sentences in the same way. These two entailments are exemplified by sentences like The meaning is right there in the words, which, according to the CONDUIT metaphor, can correctly be said of any sentence. But there are many cases where context does matter. Here is a celebrated one recorded in actual conversation by Pamela Downing: Please sit in the apple juice seat. In isolation this sentence has no meaning at all, since the expression \"apple juice seat\" is not a conventional way of referring to any kind of object. But the sentence makes perfect sense in the context in which it was uttered. An overnight guest came down to breakfast. There were four place settings, three with orange juice and one with apple juice. It was clear what the apple juice seat was. And even the next morning, when there was no apple juice, it was still clear which seat was the apple juice seat. In addition to sentences that have no meaning without context, there are cases where a single sentence will mean different things to different people. Consider: We need new alternative sources of energy. This means something very different to the president of Mobil Oil from what it means to the president of Friends of the Earth. The meaning is not right there in the sentence—it matters a lot who is saying or listening to the sentence and what his social and political attitudes are. The CONDUIT metaphor does not fit cases where context is required to determine whether the sentence has any meaning at all and, if so, what meaning it has. These examples show that the metaphorical concepts we have looked at provide us with a partial understanding of what communication, argument, and time are and that, in doing this, they hide other aspects of these concepts. It is ((13))\nimportant to see that the metaphorical structuring involved here is partial, not total. If it were total, one concept would actually be the other, not merely be understood in terms of it. For example, time isn't really money. If you spend your time trying to do something and it doesn't work, you can't get your time back. There are no time banks. I can give you a lot of time, but you can't give me back the same time, though you can give me back the same amount of time. And so on. Thus, part of a metaphorical concept does not and cannot fit. On the other hand, metaphorical concepts can be ex-tended beyond the range of ordinary literal ways of thinking and talking into the range of what is called figurative, poetic, colorful, or fanciful thought and language. Thus, if ideas are objects, we can dress them up in fancy clothes, juggle them, line them up nice and neat, etc. So when we say that a concept is structured by a metaphor, we mean that it is partially structured and that it can be extended in some ways but not others. ((14))\n4. Orientational Metaphors So far we have examined what we will call structural metaphors, cases where one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another. But there is another kind of metaphorical concept, one that does not structure one concept in terms of another but instead organizes a whole system of concepts with respect to one another. We will call these orientational metaphors, since most of them have to do with spatial orientation: up-down, in-out, front- back, on-off, deep-shallow, central-peripheral. These spatial orientations arise from the fact that we have bodies of the sort we have and that they function as they do in our physical environment. Orientational metaphors give a concept a spatial orientation; for example, HAPPY IS UP. The fact that the concept HAPPY is oriented uP leads to English expressions like \"I'm feeling up today.\" Such metaphorical orientations are not arbitrary. They have a basis in our physical and cultural experience. Though the polar oppositions up-down, in-out, etc., are physical in nature, the orientational metaphors based on them can vary from culture to culture. For example, in some cultures the future is in front of us, whereas in others it is in back. We will be looking at up-down spatialization metaphors, which have been studied intensively by William Nagy (1974), as an illustration. In each case, we will give a brief hint about how each metaphorical concept might have arisen from our physical and cultural experience. These accounts are meant to be suggestive and plausible, not definitive. ((15)) ORIENTATIONAL METAPHORS HAPPY IS UP; SAD IS DOWN I'm feeling up. That boosted my spirits. My spirits rose. You're in high spirits. Thinking about her always gives me a lift. I'm feeling down. I'm depressed. He's really low these days. I fell into a depression. My spirits sank. Physical basis: Drooping posture typically goes along with sadness and depression, erect posture with a positive emotional state. CONSCIOUS IS UP; UNCONSCIOUS IS DOWN Get up. Wake up. I'm up already. He rises early in the morning. He fell asleep. He dropped off to sleep. He's under hypnosis. He sank into a coma. Physical basis: Humans and most other mammals sleep lying down and stand up when they awaken. HEALTH AND LIFE ARE UP; SICKNESS AND DEATH ARE DOWN He's at the peak of health. Lazarus rose from the dead. He's in top shape. As to his health, he's way up there. He fell ill. He's sinking fast. He came down with the flu. His health is declining. He dropped dead. Physical basis: Serious illness forces us to lie down physically. When you're dead, you are physically down.\nHAVING CONTROl. Or FORCE IS UP; BEING SUBJECT TO CONTROL Or FORCE IS DOWN I have control over her. I am on top of the situation. He's in a superior position. He's at the height of his power. He's in the high command. He's in the upper echelon. His power rose. He ranks above me in strength. He is under my control. He fell from power. His power is on the decline. He is my social inferior. He is low man on the totem pole. Physical basis: Physical size typically correlates with physical strength, and the victor in a fight is typically on top. MORE IS UP; LESS IS DOWN The number of books printed each year keeps going up. His i 16 CHAPTER FOUR draft number is high. My income rose last year. The amount of artistic activity in this state has gone down in the past year. The number of errors he made is incredibly low. His income fell last year. He is underage. If you're too hot, turn the heat down. Physical basis: If you add more of a substance or of physical objects to a container or pile, the level goes up. FORESEEABLE FUTURE EVENTS ARE UP (and AHEAD) All up coming events are listed in the paper. What's coming up this week? I'm afraid of what's up ahead of us. What's up? Physical basis: Normally our eyes look in the direction in which we typically move (ahead, forward). As an object approaches a person (or the person approaches the object), the object appears larger. Since the ground is perceived as being fixed, the top of the object appears to be moving upward in the person's field of vision. HIGH STATUS IS UP; LOW STATUS IS DOWN He has a lofty position. She'll rise to the top. He's at the peak of his career. He's climbing the ladder. He has little upward mobility. He's at the bottom of the social hierarchy. She fell in status. Social and physical basis: Status is correlated with (social) power and (physical) power is uP. GOOD IS UP; BAD IS DOWN Things are looking up. We hit a peak last year, but it's been downhill ever since. Things are at an all-time low. He does high-quality work. Physical basis for personal well-being: Happiness, health, life, and control—the things that principally characterize what is good for a person—are all uP. VIRTUE IS UP; DEPRAVITY IS DOWN He is high-minded. She has high standards. She is upright. She is an upstanding citizen. That was a low trick. Don't be ((17)) underhanded. I wouldn't stoop to that. That would be beneath me. He fell into the abyss of depravity. That was a low-down thing to do.\nPhysical and social basis: GOOD IS UP for a person (physical basis), together with a metaphor that we will discuss below, SOCIETY IS A PERSON (in the version where you are not identifying with your society). To be virtuous is to act in accordance with the standards set by the society/person to maintain its well-being. VIRTUE IS UP because virtuous actions correlate with social well-being from the society/ person's point of view. Since socially based metaphors are part of the culture, it's the society/person's point of view that counts. RATIONAL IS UP; EMOTIONAL IS DOWN The discussion fell to the emotional level, but I raised it back up to the rational plane. We put our feelings aside and had a high-level intellectual discussion of the matter. He couldn't rise above his emotions. Physical and cultural basis: In our culture people view themselves as being in control over animals, plants, and their physical environment, and it is their unique ability to reason that places human beings above other animals and gives them this control. CONTROL IS UP thus provides a basis for MAN IS UP and therefore for RATIONAL IS UP. Conclusions On the basis of these examples, we suggest the following conclusions about the experiential grounding, the coherence, and the systematicity of metaphorical concepts: —Most of our fundamental concepts are organized in terms of one or more spatialization metaphors. —There is an internal systematicity to each spatialization metaphor. For example, HAPPY IS UP defines a coherent system rather than a number of isolated and random cases. (An example of an incoherent system would be one where, say, \"I'm ((18)) feeling up\" meant \"I'm feeling happy,\" but \"My spirits rose\" meant \"I became sadder.\") —There is an overall external systematicity among the various spatialization metaphors, which defines coherence among them. Thus, GOOD IS UP gives an uP orientation to general well-being, and this orientation is coherent with special cases like HAPPY IS UP, HEALTH IS UP, ALIVE IS UP, CONTROL IS UP. STATUS IS UP iS coherent with CONTROL IS UP. —Spatialization metaphors are rooted in physical and cultural experience; they are not randomly assigned. A metaphor can serve as a vehicle for understanding a concept only by virtue of its experiential basis. (Some of the complexities of the experiential basis of metaphor are discussed in the following sec-tion.) —There are many possible physical and social bases for metaphor. Coherence within the overall system seems to be part of the reason why one is chosen and not another. For example, happiness also tends to correlate physically with a smile and a general feeling of expansiveness. This could in principle form the basis for a metaphor HAPPY IS WIDE; SAD IS NARROW. And in fact there are minor metaphorical expressions, like \"I'm feeling expansive,\" that pick out a different aspect of happiness than \"I'm feeling up\" does. But the major metaphor in our culture is HAPPY IS UP; there is a reason\nwhy we speak of the height of ecstasy rather than the breadth of ecstasy. HAPPY IS UP is maximally coherent with GOOD IS UP, HEALTHY IS UP, etc. —In some cases spatialization is so essential a part of a concept that it is difficult for us to imagine any alternative metaphor that might structure the concept. In our society \"high status\" is such a concept. Other cases, like happiness, are less clear. Is the concept of happiness independent of the HAPPY IS UP metaphor, or is the up-down spatialization of happiness a part of the concept? We believe that it is a part of the concept within a given conceptual system. The HAPPY IS UP metaphor places happiness within a coherent metaphorical system, and part of its meaning comes from its role in that system. —So-called purely intellectual concepts, e.g., the concepts in a ((19)) scientific theory, are often—perhaps always—based on metaphors that have a physical and/or cultural basis. The high in \"high-energy particles\" is based on MORE IS UP. The high in \"high-level functions,\" as in physiological psychology, is based on RATIONAL IS UP. The low in \"low-level phonology\" (which refers to detailed phonetic aspects of the sound systems of languages) is based on MUNDANE REALITY IS DOWN (as in \"down to earth\"). The intuitive appeal of a scientific theory has to do with how well its metaphors fit one's experience. Our physical and cultural experience provides many possible bases for spatialization metaphors. Which ones are chosen, and which ones are major, may vary from culture to culture. It is hard to distinguish the physical from the cultural basis of a metaphor, since the choice of one physical basis from among many possible ones has to do with cultural coherence. Experiential Bases of Metaphors We do not know very much about the experiential bases of metaphors. Because of our ignorance in this matter, we have described the metaphors separately, only later adding speculative notes on their possible experiential bases. We are adopting this practice out of ignorance, not out of principle. In actuality we feel that no metaphor can ever he comprehended or even adequately represented independently of its experiential basis. For example, MORE IS UP has a very different kind of experiential basis than HAPPY IS UP or RATIONAL IS UP. Though the concept up is the same in all these metaphors, the experiences on which these uP metaphors are based are very different. It is not that there are many different ups; rather, verticality enters our experience in many different ways and so gives rise to many different metaphors. One way of emphasizing the inseparability of metaphors from their experiential bases would be to build the experiential basis into the representations themselves. Thus, in-stead of writing MORE IS UP and RATIONAL Is UP, we might have the more complex relationship shown in the diagram. ((20))\n((figure slettet)) Such a representation would emphasize that the two parts of each metaphor are linked only via an experiential basis and that it is only by means of these experiential bases that the metaphor can serve the purpose of understanding. We will not use such representations, but only because we know so little about experiential bases of metaphors. We will continue to use the word \"is\" in stating metaphors like MORE IS UP, but the is should be viewed as a shorthand for some set of experiences on which the metaphor is based and in terms of which we understand it. The role of the experiential basis is important in under-standing the workings of metaphors that do not fit together because they are based on different kinds of experience. Take, for example, a metaphor like UNKNOWN IS UP; KNOWN IS DOWN. Examples are \"That's up in the air\" and \"The matter is settled.\" This metaphor has an experiential basis very much like that of UNDERSTANDING IS GRASPING, as in \"I couldn't grasp his explanation.\" With physical objects, if you can grasp something and hold it in your hands, you can look it over carefully and get a reasonably good understanding of it. It's easier to grasp something and look at it carefully if it's on the ground in a fixed location than if it's floating through the air (like a leaf or a piece of paper). Thus UNKNOWN IS UP; KNOWN IS DOWN 1S coherent with UNDERSTANDING IS GRASPING. ((21)) But UNKNOWN IS UP is not coherent with metaphors like GOOD Is UP and FINISHED IS UP (as in \"I'm finishing up\"). One would expect FINISHED to be paired with KNOWN and UNFINISHED to be paired with UNKNOWN. But, so far as verticality metaphors are concerned, this is not the case. The reason is that UNKNOWN IS UP has a very different experiential basis than FINISHED Is UP.\n((22)) 5. Metaphor and Cultural Coherence The most fundamental values in a culture will be coherent with the metaphorical structure of the most fundamental concepts in the culture. As an example, let us consider some cultural values in our society that are coherent with our UP-DOWN spatialization metaphors and whose opposites would not be. \"More is better\" is coherent with MORE IS UP and GOOD IS UP. \"Less is better\" is not coherent with them. \"Bigger is better\" is coherent with MORE IS UP and GOOD IS UP. \"Smaller is better\" is not coherent with them. The future will be better\" is coherent with THE FUTURE IS UP and GooD Is UP. The future will be worse\" is not. \"There will be more in the future\" is coherent with MORE IS UP and THE FUTURE IS UP. \"Your status should be higher in the future\" is coherent with HIGH STATUS IS UP and THE FUTURE IS UP. These are values deeply embedded in our culture. The future will be better\" is a statement of the concept of progress. \"There will be more in the future\" has as special cases the accumulation of goods and wage inflation. \"Your status should be higher in the future\" is a statement of careerism. These are coherent with our present spatialization metaphors; their opposites would not be. So it seems that our values are not independent but must form a coherent system with the metaphorical concepts we live by. We are not claiming that all cultural values coherent with a ((23))\nmetaphorical system actually exist, only that those that do exist and are deeply entrenched are consistent with the metaphorical system. The values listed above hold in our culture generally—all things being equal. But because things are usually not equal, there are often conflicts among these values and hence conflicts among the metaphors associated with them. To explain such conflicts among values (and their metaphors), we must find the different priorities given to these values and metaphors by the subculture that uses them. For instance, MORE IS UP seems always to have the highest priority since it has the clearest physical basis. The priority of MORE IS UP over GOOD IS UP can be seen in examples like \"Inflation is rising\" and \"The crime rate is going up.\" Assuming that inflation and the crime rate are bad, these sentences mean what they do because MORE IS up always has top priority. In general, which values are given priority is partly a matter of the subculture one lives in and partly a matter of personal values. The various subcultures of a mainstream culture share basic values but give them different priorities. For example, BIGGER IS BETTER may be in conflict with THERE WILL BE MORE IN THE FUTURE when it comes to the question of whether to buy a big car now, with large time payments that will eat up future salary, or whether to buy a smaller, cheaper car. There are American subcultures where you buy the big car and don't worry about the future, and there are others where the future comes first and you buy the small car. There was a time (before inflation and the energy crisis) when owning a small car had a high status within the subculture where VIRTUE IS UP and SAVING RE- SOURCES IS VIRTUOUS took priority over BIGGER IS BETTER. Nowadays the number of small-car owners has gone up drastically because there is a large subculture where SAV-ING MONEY IS BETTER has priority over BIGGER IS BETTER. In addition to subcultures, there are groups whose defining characteristic is that they share certain important values ((24)) that conflict with those of the mainstream culture. But in less obvious ways they preserve other mainstream values. Take monastic orders like the Trappists. There LESS IS BET-TER and SMALLER IS BETTER are true with respect to material possessions, which are viewed as hindering what is important, namely, serving God. The Trappists share the mainstream value VIRTUE IS UP, though they give it the highest priority and a very different definition. MORE is still BETTER, though it applies to virtue; and status is still uP, though it is not of this world but of a higher one, the Kingdom of God. Moreover, THE FUTURE WILL BE BETTER is true in terms of spiritual growth (uP) and, ultimately, salvation (really uP). This is typical of groups that are out of the mainstream culture. Virtue, goodness, and status may be radically redefined, but they are still uP. It is still better to have more of what is important, THE FUTURE WILL BE BETTER with respect to what is important, and so on. Relative to what is important for a monastic group, the value system is both internally coherent and, with respect to what is important for the group, coherent with the major orientational metaphors of the mainstream culture. Individuals, like groups, vary in their priorities and in the ways they define what is good or virtuous to them. In this sense, they are subgroups of one. Relative to what is important for them, their individual value systems are coherent with the major orientational metaphors of the main-stream culture.\nNot all cultures give the priorities we do to up-down orientation. There are cultures where balance or centrality plays a much more important role than it does in our culture. Or consider the nonspatial orientation active-passive. For us ACTIVE IS UP and PASSIVE IS DOWN in most matters. But there are cultures where passivity is valued more than activity. In general the major orientations up-down, in-out, central-peripheral, active-passive, etc., seem to cut across all cultures, but which concepts are oriented which way and which orientations are most important vary from culture to culture. ((25)) 6 Ontological Metaphors Entity and Substance Metaphors Spatial orientations like up-down, front-back, on-off, center-periphery, and near-far provide an extraordinarily rich basis for understanding concepts in orientational terms. But one can do only so much with orientation. Our experience of physical objects and substances provides a further basis for understanding—one that goes beyond mere orientation. Understanding our experiences in terms of objects and substances allows us to pick out parts of our experience and treat them as discrete entities or substances of a uniform kind. Once we can identify our experiences as entities or substances, we can refer to them, categorize them, group them, and quantify them—and, by this means, reason about them. When things are not clearly discrete or bounded, we still categorize them as such, e.g., mountains, street corners, hedges, etc. Such ways of viewing physical phenomena are needed to satisfy certain purposes that we have: locating mountains, meeting at street corners, trimming hedges. Human purposes typically require us to impose artificial boundaries that make physical phenomena discrete just as we are: entities bounded by a surface. Just as the basic experiences of human spatial orientations give rise to orientational metaphors, so our experiences with physical objects (especially our own bodies) provide the basis for an extraordinarily wide variety of on- tological metaphors, that is, ways of viewing events, activities, emotions, ideas, etc., as entities and substances. Ontological metaphors serve various purposes, and the ((26)) various kinds of metaphors there are reflect the kinds of purposes served. Take the\nexperience of rising prices, which can be metaphorically viewed as an entity via the noun inflation. This gives us a way of referring to the experience: INFLATION IS AN ENTITY Inflation is lowering our standard of living. If there's much more inflation, we'll never survive. We need to combat inflation. Inflation is hacking us into a corner. Inflation is taking its toll at the checkout counter and the gas pump. Buying land is the best way of dealing with inflation. Inflation makes me sick. In these cases, viewing inflation as an entity allows us to refer to it, quantify it, identify a particular aspect of it, see it as a cause, act with respect to it, and perhaps even believe that we understand it. Ontological metaphors like this are necessary for even attempting to deal rationally with our experiences. The range of ontological metaphors that we use for such purposes is enormous. The following list gives some idea of the kinds of purposes, along with representative examples of ontological metaphors that serve them. Referring My fear of insects is driving my wife crazy. That was a beautiful catch. We are working toward peace. The middle class is powerful silent force in American politics. The honor of our country is at stake in this war. Quantifying It will take a lot of patience to finish this book. There is so much hatred in the world. DuPont has a lot of political power in Delaware. You've got too much hostility in you. ((27)) Pete Rose has a lot of hustle and baseball know-how. Identifying Aspects The ugly side of his personality comes out under pressure. The brutality of war dehumanizes us all. I can't keep up with the pace of modern life. His emotional health has deteriorated recently. We never got to feel the thrill of victory in Vietnam. Identifying Causes The pressure of his responsibilities caused his breakdown. He did it out of anger. Our influence in the world has declined because of our lack of moral .fiber. Internal dissension cost them the pennant. Setting Goals and Motivating Actions He went to New York to seek fame and fortune. Here's what you have to do to insure financial security. I'm changing my way of life so that I can find true happiness. The FBI will act quickly in the face of a threat to national se- curity. She saw getting married as the solution to her problems. As in the case of orientational metaphors, most of these expressions are not noticed as being metaphorical. One reason for this is that ontological metaphors, like orientational metaphors, serve a very limited range of purposes—referring, quantifying, etc. Merely viewing a nonphysical thing as an entity or substance does not allow us to comprehend very much about it. But ontological metaphors\nmay be further elaborated. Here are two examples of how the ontological metaphor THE MIND IS AN ENTITY IS elaborated in our culture. THE MIND IS A MACHINE We're still trying to grind out the solution to this equation. My mind just isn't operating today. Boy, the wheels are turning now! I'm a little rusty today. We've been working on this problem all day and now we're running out of steam. ((28)) THE MIND IS A BRITTLE OBJECT Her ego is very fragile. You have to handle him with care since his wife's death. He broke under cross-examination. She is easily crushed. The experience shattered him. I'm going to pieces. His mind snapped. These metaphors specify different kinds of objects. They give us different metaphorical models for what the mind is and thereby allow us to focus on different aspects of mental experience. The MACHINE metaphor gives us a conception of the mind as having an on-off state, a level of efficiency, a productive capacity, an internal mechanism, a source of energy, and an operating condition. The BRITTLE OBJECT metaphor is not nearly as rich. It allows us to talk only about psychological strength. However, there is a range of mental experience that can be conceived of in terms of either metaphor. The examples we have in mind are these: He broke down. (THE MIND IS A MACHINE) He cracked up. (THE MIND IS A BRITTLE OBJECT) But these two metaphors do not focus on exactly the same aspect of mental experience. When a machine breaks down, it simply ceases to function. When a brittle object shatters, its pieces go flying, with possibly dangerous consequences. Thus, for example, when someone goes crazy and becomes wild or violent, it would be appropriate to say \"He cracked up.\" On the other hand, if someone becomes lethargic and unable to function for psychological reasons, we would be more likely to say \"He broke down.\" Ontological metaphors like these are so natural and so pervasive in our thought that they are usually taken as self-evident, direct descriptions of mental phenomena. The fact that they are metaphorical never occurs to most of us. We take statements like \"He cracked under pressure\" as being directly true or false. This expression was in fact used by ((29)) various journalists to explain why Dan White brought his gun to the San Francisco City Hall and shot and killed Mayor George Moscone. Explanations of this sort seem perfectly natural to most of us. The reason is that metaphors like THE MIND IS A BRITTLE OBJECT are an integral part of the model of the mind that we have in this culture; it is the model most of\nus think and operate in terms of. Container Metaphors Land Areas We are physical beings, bounded and set off from the rest of the world by the surface of our skins, and we experience the rest of the world as outside us. Each of us is a container, with a bounding surface and an in-out orientation. We project our own in-out orientation onto other physical objects that are bounded by surfaces. Thus we also view them as containers with an inside and an outside. Rooms and houses are obvious containers. Moving from room to room is moving from one container to another, that is, moving out of one room and into another. We even give solid objects this orientation, as when we break a rock open to see what's inside it. We impose this orientation on our natural environment as well. A clearing in the woods is seen as having a bounding surface, and we can view ourselves as being in the clearing or out of the clearing, in the woods or out of the woods. A clearing in the woods has something we can perceive as a natural boundary—the fuzzy area where the trees more or less stop and the clearing more or less begins. But even where there is no natural physical boundary that can be viewed as defining a container, we impose boundaries—marking off territory so that it has an inside and a bounding surface—whether a wall, a fence, or an abstract line or plane. There are few human instincts more basic than territoriality. And such defining of a territory, putting a boundary around it, is an act of quantification. ((30)) Bounded objects, whether human beings, rocks, or land areas, have sizes. This allows them to be quantified in terms of the amount of substance they contain. Kansas, for example, is a bounded area— a CONTAINER—which is why we can say, \"There's a lot of land in Kansas.\" Substances can themselves be viewed as containers. Take a tub of water, for example. When you get into the tub, you get into the water. Both the tub and the water are viewed as containers, but of different sorts. The tub is a CONTAINER OBJECT, while the water is a CONTAINER SUB-STANCE. The Visual Field We conceptualize our visual field as a container and conceptualize what we see as being inside it. Even the term \"visual field\" suggests this. The metaphor is a natural one that emerges from the fact that, when you look at some territory (land, floor space, etc.), your field of vision defines a boundary of the territory, namely, the part that you can see. Given that a bounded physical space is a CONTAINER and that our field of vision correlates with that bounded physical space, the metaphorical concept VISUAL FIELDS ARE CONTAINERS emerges naturally. Thus we can say: The ship is coming into view. I have him in sight. I can't see him—the tree is in the way. He's out of sight now. That's in the center of my field of vision. There's nothing in sight.\nI can't get all of the ships in sight at once. Events, Actions, Activities, and States We use ontological metaphors to comprehend events, actions, activities, and states. Events and actions are conceptualized metaphorically as objects, activities as sub-stances, states as containers. A race, for example, is an event, which is viewed as a discrete entity. The race exists ((31)) in space and time, and it has well-defined boundaries. Hence we view it as a CONTAINER OBJECT, having in it participants (which are objects), events like the start and finish (which are metaphorical objects), and the activity of running (which is a metaphorical substance). Thus we can say of a race: Are you in the race on Sunday? (race as CONTAINER OBJECT) Are you going to the race? (race as OBJECT) Did you see the race? (race as OBJECT) The finish of the race was really exciting. (finish as EVENT OBJECT within CONTAINER OBJECT) There was a lot of good running in the race. (running as a SUBSTANCE in a CONTAINER) I couldn't do much sprinting until the end. (sprinting as SUBSTANCE) Halfway into the race, I ran out of energy. (race as CON- TAINER OBJECT) He's out of the race now. (race as CONTAINER OBJECT) Activities in general are viewed metaphorically as SUB- STANCES and therefore as CONTAINERS: In washing the window, I splashed water all over the floor. How did Jerry get out of washing the windows? Outside of washing the windows, what else did you do? Hoer much window-washing did you do? How did you get into window-washing as a profession? He's immersed in washing the windows right now. Thus, activities are viewed as containers for the actions and other activities that make them up. They are also viewed as containers for the energy and materials required for them and for their by-products, which may be viewed as in them or as emerging from them: I put a lot of energy into washing the windows. I get a lot of satisfaction out of washing windows. There is a lot of satisfaction in washing windows. Various kinds of states may also be conceptualized as containers. Thus we have examples like these:\n((32)) He's in love. We're out of trouble now. He's coming out of the coma. I'm slowly getting into shape. He entered a state of euphoria. He fell into a depression. He finally emerged from the catatonic state he had been in since the end of finals week. ((33)) 7. Personification Perhaps the most obvious ontological metaphors are those where the physical object is further specified as being a person. This allows us to comprehend a wide variety of experiences with nonhuman entities in terms of human motivations, characteristics, and activities. Here are some examples: His theory explained to me the behavior of chickens raised in factories. This fact argues against the standard theories. Life has cheated me. Inflation is eating up our profits. His religion tells him that he cannot drink fine French wines. The Michelson-Morley experiment gave birth to a new physical theory. Cancer finally caught up with him. In each of these cases we are seeing something nonhuman as human. But personification is not a single unified general process. Each personification differs in terms of the aspects of people that are picked out. Consider these examples. Inflation has attacked the foundation of our economy. Inflation has pinned us to the wall. Our biggest enemy right now is inflation. The dollar has been destroyed by inflation. Inflation has robbed me of my savings. Inflation has outwitted the best economic minds in the country. Inflation has given birth to a money-minded generation. Here inflation is personified, but the metaphor is not\n((34)) merely INFLATION IS A PERSON. It is much more specific, namely, INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY. It not only gives us a very specific way of thinking about inflation but also a way of acting toward it. We think of inflation as an adversary that can attack us, hurt us, steal from us, even destroy us. The INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY metaphor therefore gives rise to and justifies political and economic actions on the part of our government: declaring war on inflation, setting targets, calling for sacrifices, installing a new chain of command, etc. The point here is that personification is a general category that covers a very wide range of metaphors, each picking out different aspects of a person or ways of looking at a person. What they all have in common is that they are extensions of ontological metaphors and that they allow us to make sense of phenomena in the world in human terms—terms that we can understand on the basis of our own motivations, goals, actions, and characteristics. View- ing something as abstract as inflation in human terms has an explanatory power of the only sort that makes sense to most people. When we are suffering substantial economic losses due to complex economic and political factors that no one really understands, the INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY metaphor at least gives us a coherent account of why we're suffering these losses. ((35)) 8. Metonymy In the cases of personification that we have looked at we are imputing human qualities to things that are not human—theories, diseases, inflation, etc. In such cases there are no\nactual human beings referred to. When we say \"Inflation robbed me of my savings,\" we are not using the term \"in-flation\" to refer to a person. Cases like this must be distinguished from cases like The ham sandwich is waiting for his check. where the expression \"the ham sandwich\" is being used to refer to an actual person, the person who ordered the ham sandwich. Such cases are not instances of personification metaphors, since we do not understand \"the ham sandwich\" by imputing human qualities to it. Instead, we are using one entity to refer to another that is related to it. This is a case of what we will call metonymy. Here are some further examples: He likes to read the Marquis de Sade. (= the writings of the marquis) He's in dance. (= the dancing profession) Acrylic has taken over the art world. (= the use of acrylic paint) The Times hasn't arrived at the press conference yet. (= the reporter from the Times) Mrs. Grundy frowns on blue jeans. (= the wearing of blue jeans) New windshield wipers will satisfy him. (= the state of hav-ing new wipers) ((36)) We are including as a special case of metonymy what traditional rhetoricians have called synecdoche, where the part stands for the whole, as in the following. THE PART FOR THE WHOLE The automobile is clogging our highways. (= the collection of automobiles) We need a couple of strong bodies for our team. (= strong people) There are a lot of good heads in the university. (= intelligent people) I've got a new set of wheels. (= car, motorcycle. etc.) We need some new blood in the organization. (= new people) In these cases, as in the other cases of metonymy, one entity is being used to refer to another. Metaphor and. metonymy are different kinds of processes. Metaphor is principally a way of conceiving of one thing in terms of another, and its primary function is understanding. Metonymy, on the other hand, has primarily a referential function, that is, it allows us to use one entity to stand. for another. But metonymy is not merely a referential device. It also serves the function of providing understanding. For example, in the case of the metonymy THE PART FOR THE WHOLE there are many parts that can stand for the whole. Which part we pick out determines which aspect of the whole we are focusing on. When we say that we need some good heads on the project, we are using \"good heads\" to refer to \"intelligent people.\" The point is not just to use a part (head) to stand for a whole (person) but rather to pick out a particular characteristic of the person, namely, intelligence, which is associated with the head. The same is true of other kinds of metonymies. When we say The Times hasn't arrived at the press conference yet,\" we are using \"The Times\" not merely to refer to some\nreporter or other but also to suggest the importance of the institution the reporter represents. So \"The Times has not yet arrived for the press conference\" means something different from ((37)) \"Steve Roberts has not yet arrived for the press conference,\" even though Steve Roberts may be the Tinnes reporter in question. Thus metonymy serves some of the same purposes that metaphor does, and in somewhat the same way, but it allows us to focus more specifically on certain aspects of what is being referred to. It is also like metaphor in that it is not just a poetic or rhetorical device. Nor is it just a matter of language. Metonymic concepts (like TEIE PART FOR THE WHOLE) are part of the ordinary, everyday way we think and act as well as talk. For example, we have in our conceptual system a special case of the metonymy THE PART FOR THE WHOLE, namely, THE FACE FOR THE PERSON. For example: She's just a pretty face. There are an nmrfirl lot o faces out there in the audience. We need some new fcices around here. This metonymy functions actively in our culture. The tradi-tion of portraits, in both painting and photography, is based on it. If you ask me to show you a picture of my son and I show you a picture of his face, you will be satisfied. You will consider yourself to have seen a picture of him. But if I show you a picture of his body without his face, you will consider it strange and will not be satisfied. You might even ask, \"But what does he look like?\" Thus the metonymy THE FACE FOR THE PERSON is not merely a matter of language. In our culture we look at a person's face—rather than his posture or his movements—to get our basic in- formation about what the person is like. We function in terms of a metonymy when we perceive the person in terms of his face and act on those perceptions. Like metaphors, metonymies are not random or arbitrary occurrences, to be treated as isolated instances. Metonymic concepts are also systematic, as can be seen in the follow-ing representative examples that exist in our culture. ((38)) THE PART FOR THE WHOLE Get your butt over here! We don't hire longhairs. The Giants need a stronger arm in right field. I've got a new four-on-the-floor V-8. PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT I'll have a Lohrenbrc u. He bought a Ford. He's got a Picasso in his den. I hate to read Heidegger. OBJECT USED FOR USER The sax has the flu today. The BLT is a lousy tipper.\nThe gun he hired wanted fifty grand. We need a better,,'lolveat third base. The buses are on strike. (ONTROI.1.1[R FOR CONTROI.I.FD Nixon bombed Hanoi. Ozawa gave a terrible concert last night. Napoleon lost at Waterloo. Casey Stengel won a lot of pennants. A Mercedes rear-ended inc. INSTITUTION FOR PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE Exxon has raised its prices again. You'll never get the university to agree to that. The Army wants to reinstitute the draft. The Senate thinks abortion is immoral. I don't approve of the government's actions. THE PLACE FOR THE INSTITUTION The White House isn't saying anything. Washington is insensitive to the needs of the people. The Kremlin threatened to boycott the next round of SALT talks. Paris is introducing longer skirts this season. Hollywood isn't what it used to be. Wall Street is in a panic. ((39)) THE PLACE FOR THE EVENT Let's not let Thailand become'another Vietnam. Remember the Alamo. Pearl Harbor still has an effect on our foreign policy. Watergate changed our politics. It's been Grand Central Station here all day. Metonymic concepts like these are systematic in the same way that metaphoric concepts are. The sentences given above are not random. They are instances of certain general metonymic concepts in terms of which we organize our thoughts and actions. Metonymic concepts allow us to conceptualize one thing by means of its relation to some-thing else. When we think of a Picasso, we are not just thinking of a work of art alone, in and of itself. We think of it in terms of its relation to the artist, that is, his conception of art, his technique, his role in art history, etc. We act with reverence toward a Picasso, even a sketch he made as a teen-ager, because of its relation to the artist. This is a way in which the PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT metonymy affects both our thought and our action. Similarly, when a waitress says The ham sandwich wants his check,\" she is not interested in the person as a person hut only as a customer, which is why the use of such a sentence is dehumanizing. Nixon himself may not have dropped the bombs on Hanoi, but via the CONTROLLER FOR CONTROII ED metonymy we not only say \"Nixon bombed Hanoi\" but also think of him as doing the bombing and hold him responsible for it. Again this is possible because of the nature of the metonymic relationship in the CONTROLLER FOR CONTROLLED metonymy, where responsibility is what is focused on. Thus, like metaphors, metonymic concepts structure not just our language but our thoughts, attitudes, and actions. And, like metaphoric concepts, metonymic concepts are grounded in our experience. In fact, the grounding of metonymic concepts is in general more obvious than is the case with metaphoric concepts, since it usually involves direct physical or causal associations. The PART FOR ((40))\nWHOLE metonymy, for example, emerges from our experiences with the way parts in general are related to wholes. PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT is based on the causal (and typically physical) relationship between a producer and his product. THE PLACE FOR THE EVENT is grounded in our experience with the physical location of events. And so on. Cultural and religious symbolism are special cases of metonymy. Within Christianity, for example, there is the metonymy DOVE FOR HOLY SPIRIT. As is typical with metonymies, this symbolism is not arbitrary. It is grounded in the conception of the dove in Western culture and the conception of the Holy Spirit in Christian theology. There is a reason why the dove is the symbol of the Holy Spirit and not, say, the chicken, the vulture, or the ostrich. The dove is conceived of as beautiful, friendly, gentle, and, above all, peaceful. As a bird, its natural habitat is the sky, which metonymically stands for heaven, the natural habitat of the Holy Spirit. The dove is a bird that flies gracefully, glides silently, and is typically seen coming out of the sky and landing among people. The conceptual systems of cultures and religions are metaphorical in nature. Symbolic metonymies are critical links between everyday experience and the coherent metaphorical systems that characterize religions and cultures. Symbolic metonymies that are grounded in our physical experience provide an essential means of comprehending religious and cultural concepts. ((41))\n9. Challenges to Metaphorical Coherence We have offered evidence that metaphors and metonymies are not random but instead form coherent systems in terms of which we conceptualize our experience. But it is easy to find apparent incoherences in everyday metaphorical expressions. We have not made a complete study of these, but those that we have looked at in detail have turned out not to be incoherent at all, though they appeared that way at first. Let us consider two examples. An Apparent Metaphorical Contradiction Charles Fillmore has observed (in conversation) that English appears to have two contradictory organizations of time. In the first, the future is in front and the past is behind: In the weeks ahead of us... (future) That's all behind us now. (past) In the second, the future is behind and the past is in front: In the following weeks ... (future) In the preceding weeks... (past) This appears to be a contradiction in the metaphorical organization of time. Moreover, the apparently contradictory metaphors can mix with no ill effect, as in We're looking ahead to the following weeks. Here it appears that ahead organizes the future in front, while following organizes it behind. To see that there is, in fact, a coherence here, we first ((42)) have to consider some facts about front-back organization. Some things, like people and cars, have inherent fronts and backs, but others, like trees, do not. A rock may receive a front-back organization under certain circumstances. Sup-pose you are looking at a medium-sized rock and there is a ball between you and the rock—say, a foot away from the rock. Then it is appropriate for you to say \"The ball is in front of the rock.\" The rock has received a front-back orientation, as if it had a front that faced you. This is not universal. There are languages—Hausa, for instance—where the rock would receive the reverse orientation and you would say that the ball was behind the rock if it was between you and the rock. Moving objects generally receive a front-back orientation so that the front is in the direction of motion (or in the canonical direction of motion, so that a car backing up retains its front). A spherical satellite, for example, that has no front while standing still, gets a\nfront while in orbit by virtue of the direction in which it is moving. Now, time in English is structured in terms of the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor, with the future moving toward us: The time will come when .. . The time has long since gone when .. . The time for action has arrived. The proverb \"Time flies\" is an instance of the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor. Since we are facing toward the future, we get: Coming up in the weeks ahead .. . I look forward to the arrival of Christmas. Before us is a great opportunity, and we don't want it to pass us by. By virtue of the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor, time receives a front-back orientation facing in the direction of motion, just as any moving object would. Thus the future is ((43)) facing toward us as it moves toward us, and we find expressions like: I can't face the future. The face of things to come .. . Let's meet the future head-on. Now, while expressions like ahead of us, I look forward, and before us orient times with respect to people, expressions like precede and follow orient times with respect to times. Thus we get: Next week and the week following it. but not: The week following me .. Since future times are facing toward us, the times following them are further in the future, and all future times follow the present. That is why the weeks to follow are the same as the weeks ahead of us. The point of this example is not merely to show that there is no contradiction but also to show all the subtle details that are involved: the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor, the front-back orientation given to time by virtue of its being a moving object, and the consistent application of words like follow, precede, and face when applied to time on the basis of the metaphor. All of this consistent detailed metaphorical structure is part of our everyday literal language about time, so familiar that we would normally not notice it. Coherence versus Consistency We have shown that the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor has an internal consistency. But there is another way in which we conceptualize the passing of time: TIME IS STATIONARY AND WE MOVE THROUGH IT As we go through the years,. ..\n((44)) As we go further into the 1980s, .. . We're approaching the end of the year. What we have here are two subcases of TIME PASSES us: in one case, we are moving and time is standing still; in the other, time is moving and we are standing still. What is in common is relative motion with respect to us, with the fu-ture in front and the past behind. That is, they are two subcases of the same metaphor, as shown in the accompanying diagram. From our point of view time goes past us, from front to back Time is a moving object and moves toward us Time is stationary and we move through it in the direction of the future This is another way of saying that they have a major corn-mon entailment. Both metaphors entail that, from our point of view, time goes past us from front to back. Although the two metaphors are not consistent (that is, they form no single image), they nonetheless \"fit together,\" by virtue of being subcategories of a major category and therefore sharing a major common entailment. There is a difference between metaphors that are coherent (that is, \"fit together\") with each other and those that are consistent. We have found that the connections between metaphors are more likely to involve coherence than con- sistency. As another example, let us take another metaphor: LOVE IS A JOURNEY Look how far we've come. We're at a crossroads. We'll just have to go our separate ways. We can't turn hack now. I don't think this relationship is going anywhere. ((45)) Where are we? We're stuck. It's been a long, humpy road. This relationship is a dead-end street. We're just spinning our wheels. Our marriage is on the rocks. We've gotten off the track. This relationship is foundering. Here the basic metaphor is that of a JOURNEY, and there are various types of journeys that one can make: a car trip, a train trip, or a sea voyage. JOURNEY Car trip Trai Once again, there is no single consistent image that the JOURNEY metaphors all fit. What\nmakes them coherent is that they are all JOURNEY metaphors, though they specify different means of travel. The same sort of thing occurs with the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor, where there are various ways in which something can move. Thus, time flies, time creeps along, tirne speeds hy. In general, metaphorical concepts are defined not in terms of concrete images (flying, creeping, going down the road, etc.), but in terms of more general categories, like passing. Trip ((46)) 10. Some Further Examples We have been claiming that metaphors partially structure our everyday concepts and that this structure is reflected in our literal language. Before we can get an overall picture of the philosophical implications of these claims, we need a few more examples. In each of the ones that follow we give a metaphor and a list of ordinary expressions that are special cases of the metaphor. The English expressions are of two sorts: simple literal expressions and idioms that fit the metaphor and are part of the normal everyday way of talk-ing about the subject. THEORIES (and ARGUMENTS) ARE BUILDINGS Is that the foundation for your theory? The theory needs more support. The argument is shaky. We need some more facts or the argument will fall apart. We need to construct strong argument for that. I haven't figured out yet what the form of the argument will be. Here are some more facts to shore up the theory. We need to buttress the theory with solid arguments. The theory will stand on the strength of that argument. The argument collapsed. They exploded his latest theory. We will show that theory to be without foundation. So far we have put together only the framework of the theory. IDEAS ARE FOOD What he said left a had taste in my mouth. All this paper has in it are raw facts, half-baked ideas, and harmed-over theories. There are too many facts here for me to digest them all. I just can't swallow that claim. That argument smells fishy. Let me stew over that for a while. Now there's a theory ((47))\nyou can really sink your teeth into. We need to let that idea percolate for a while. That's food for thought. He's a voracious reader. We don't need to spoon-feed our students. He devoured the book. Let's let that idea simmer on the back burner for a while. This is the meaty part of the paper. Let that idea jell for a while. That idea has been fermenting for years. With respect to life and death IDEAS ARE ORGANISMS, either PEOPLE Or PLANTS. IDEAS ARE PEOPLE The theory of relativity gave birth to an enormous number of ideas in physics. He is the father of modern biology. Whose brainchild was that? Look at what his ideas have spawned. Those ideas died off in the Middle Ages. His ideas will live on forever. Cognitive psychology is still in its infancy. That's an idea that ought to be resurrected. Where'd you dig up that idea? He breathed new life into that idea. IDEAS ARE PLANTS His ideas have finally come to fruition. That idea died on the vine. That's a budding theory. It will take years for that idea to come to fall flower. He views chemistry as a mere offshoot of physics. Mathematics has many branches. The seeds of his great ideas were planted in his youth. She has a. fertile imagination. Here's an idea that I'd like to plant in your mind. He has a barren mind. IDEAS ARE PRODUCTS We're really turning (churning, cranking, grinding) out new ideas. We've generated a lot of ideas this week. He produces new ideas at an astounding rate. His intellectual productivity has decreased in recent years. We need to take the rough edges off that idea, hone it down, smooth it out. Its a rough idea; it needs to be refined. IDEAS ARE COMMODITIES It's important how you package your ideas. He won't buy that. That idea just won't sell. There is always a market for good ideas. That's a worthless idea. He's been a source of ((48)) valuable ideas. I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for that idea. Your ideas don't have a chance in the intellectual marketplace. IDEAS ARE RESOURCES He ran out of ideas. Don't waste your thoughts on small projects. Let's pool our ideas. He's a resourceful man. We've used up all our ideas. That's a useless idea. That idea will go a long way. IDEAS ARE MONEY Let me put in my two cents' worth. He's rich in ideas. That book is a treasure trove of ideas. He has a wealth of ideas. IDEAS ARE CUTTING INSTRUMENTS That's an incisive idea. That cuts right to the heart of the matter. That was a cutting remark. He's sharp. He has a razor wit. He has a keen mind. She cut his argument to ribbons. IDEAS ARE FASHIONS That idea went out of style years ago. I hear sociobiology is in these days. Marxism is currently ,fashionable in western Europe. That idea is old hat! That's an outdated idea. What are the new trends in English criticism? Old-fashioned notions have no place in today's society. He keeps up-to- date by read-ing the New York Review of Books. Berkeley is a center of avant-garde thought. Semiotics has become quite chic. The idea of revolution is no longer in vogue in the United States. The transformational grammar craze hit the United States in the mid-sixties and has just made it to Europe. UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING; IDEAS ARE LIGHT-SOURCES; DIS-COURSE IS A LIGHT-MEDIUM I see what you're saying. It looks different from my point cif view. What is your outlook on that? I view it differently. Now I've got the whole picture. Let me point something out to you. That's an insightful idea. That was a brilliant remark. The argument is clear. It was a murky discussion. Could you elucidate your remarks? It's a transparent argument. The discussion was opaque.\n((49)) LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE (ELECTROMAGNETIC, GRAVITATIONAL, etc.) I could feel the electricity between us. There were sparks. I was magnetically drawn to her. They are uncontrollably attracted to each other. They gravitated to each other immediately. His whole life revolves around her. The atmosphere around them is always charged. There is incredible energy in their relationship. They lost their momentum. LOVE IS A PATIENT This is a sick relationship. They have a. strong, healthy marriage. The marriage is dead—it can't be revived. Their marriage is on the mend. We're getting back on our feet. Their relationship is in really good shape. They've got a listless marriage. Their marriage is on its last legs. It's a tired affair. LOVE IS MADNESS 1'm crazy about her. She drives inc out of my mind. He constantly raves about her. He's gone mad over her. I'm just gild about Harry. I'm insane about her. LOVE. IS MAGIC She cast her spell over me. The magic is gone. I was spellbound. She had me hypnotized. He has me in a trance. I was entranced by him. I'm charmed by her. She is bewitch-ing. LOVE IS WAR He is known for his many rapid conquests. She.fought for him, but his mistress iron out. He fled from her advances. She pursued him relentlessly. He is slowly gaining ground with her. He won her hand in marriage. He overpowered her. She is besieged by suitors. He has to fend them qff. He enlisted the aid of her friends. He made an ally of her mother. Theirs is a misalliance if I've ever seen one. WEALTH IS A HIDDEN OBJECT He's seeking his fortune. He's flaunting his newfound wealth. He's a fortune-hunter. She's a gold- digger. He lost his fortune. He's searching for wealth. ((50)) SIGNIFICANT IS BIG He's a big man in the garment industry. He's a giant among writers. That's the biggest idea to hit advertising in years. He's head and shoulders above everyone in the industry. It was only a small crime. That was only a little white lie. I was astounded at the enormity of the crime. That was one of the greatest moments in World Series history. His accomplishments tower over those of lesser men. SEEING IS TOUCHING; EYES ARE LIMBS I can't take my eyes qff her. He sits with his eyes glued to the TV. Her eyes picked out every detail of the pattern. Their eyes met. She never moves her eyes from his face. She ran her eyes over everything in the room. He wants everything within reach his eyes. THE EYES ARE CONTAINERS FOR THE EMOTIONS I could see the fear in his eyes. His eyes were filled with anger. There was passion in her eyes. His eyes displayed his compassion. She couldn't get the fear out of her eyes. Love showed in his eyes. Her eyes gwith emotion. EMOTIONAL EFFECT IS PHYSICAL CONTACT\nHis mother's death hit him hard. That idea bowled me over. She's a knockout. I was struck by his sincerity. That really made an impression on me. He made his mark on the world. I was touched by his remark. That blew me away. PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATES ARE ENTITIES WITHIN A PERSON He has a pain in his shoulder. Don't give me the flu. My cold has gone from my head to my chest. His pains went away. His depression returned. Hot tea and honey will get rid of your cough. He could barely contain his joy. The smile loft his face. Wipe that sneer off your face, private! His fears keep coming back. I've got to shake off this depression—it keeps hanging on. If you've got a cold, drinking lots of tea will flush it out of your system. There isn't a trace of cowardice in him. He hasn't got an honest hone in his body. ((51)) VITALITY IS A SUBSTANCE She's brimming with vim and vigor. She's overflowing with vitality. He's devoid of energy. I don't have any energy left at the end of the day. I'm drained. That took a lot out of me. LIFE IS A CONTAINER I've had a full life. Life is empty for him. There's not much left for him in life. Her life is crammed with activities. Get the most out of life. His life contained a great deal of sorrow. Live your life to the fullest. LIFE IS A GAMBLING GAME I'll take my chances. The odds are against me. I've got an ace up my sleeve. He's holding all the aces. It's a toss-up. If you play your cards right, you can do it. He won big. He's a real loser. Where is he when the chips are down? That's my ace in the hole. He's bluffing. The president is playing it close to his vest. Let's up the ante. Maybe we need to sweeten the pot. I think we should stand pat. That's the luck of the dras,'. Those are high stakes. In this last group of examples we have a collection of what are called \"speech formulas,\" or \"fixed-form expressions,\" or \"phrasal lexical items.\" These function in many ways like single words, and the language has thousands of them. In the examples given, a set of such phrasal lexical items is coherently structured by a single metaphorical concept. Although each of them is an instance of the LIFE IS A GAMBLING GAME metaphor, they are typically used to speak of life, not of gambling situations. They are normal ways of talking about life situations, just as using the word \"construct\" is a normal way of talking about theories. It is in this sense that we include them in what we have called literal expressions structured by metaphorical concepts. If you say The odds are against us\" or \"We'll have to take our chances,\" you would not be viewed as speaking metaphorically but as using the normal everyday language appropriate to the situation. Nevertheless, your way of talking about, conceiving, and even experiencing your situation would be metaphorically structured. ((52))\n11. The Partial Nature of Metaphorical Structuring Up to this point we have described the systematic character of metaphorically defined concepts. Such concepts are understood in terms of a number of different metaphors (e.g., TIME IS MONEY, TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT, etc.). The metaphorical structuring of concepts is necessarily partial and is reflected in the lexicon of the language, including the phrasal lexicon, which contains fixed-form expressions such as \"to be without foundation.\" Because concepts are metaphorically structured in a systematic way, e.g., THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS, it is possible for us to use expressions (construct, foundation) from one domain (BUILDINGS) to talk about corresponding concepts in the metaphorically defined domain (THEORIES). What foundation, for example, means in the metaphorically defined do-main (THEORY) will depend on the details of how the metaphorical concept THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS iS used to structure the concept THEORY. The parts of the concept BUILDING that are used to structure the concept THEORY are the foundation and the outer shell. The roof, internal rooms, staircases, and hall-ways are parts of a building not used as part of the concept THEORY. Thus the metaphor THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS has a \"used\" part (foundation and outer shell) and an \"un-used\" part (rooms, staircases, etc.). Expressions such as construct and foundation are instances of the used part of such a metaphorical concept and are part of our ordinary literal language about theories. But what of the linguistic expressions that reflect the ((53)) \"unused\" part of a metaphor like THEORIES ARE BUILD-INGS? Here are four examples: His theory has thousands of little rooms and long, winding corridors.\nHis theories are Bauhaus in their pseudofunctional simplicity. He prefers massive Gothic theories covered with gargoyles. Complex theories usually have problems with the plumbing. These sentences fall outside the domain of normal literal language and are part of what is usually called \"figurative\" or \"imaginative\" language. Thus, literal expressions (\"He has constructed a theory\") and imaginative expressions (\"His theory is covered with gargoyles\") can be instances of the same general metaphor (THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS). Here we can distinguish three different subspecies of imaginative (or nonliteral) metaphor: Extensions of the used part of a metaphor, e.g., \"These facts are the bricks and mortar of my theory.\" Here the outer shell of the building is referred to, whereas the THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS metaphor stops short of mentioning the materials used. Instances of the unused part of the literal metaphor, e.g., \"His theory has thousands of little rooms and long, winding corridors.\" Instances of novel metaphor, that is, a metaphor not used to structure part of our normal conceptual system but as a new way of thinking about something, e.g., \"Classical theories are patriarchs who father many children, most of whom fight incessantly.\" Each of these subspecies lies outside the used part of a metaphorical concept that structures our normal conceptual system. We note in passing that all of the linguistic expressions we have given to characterize general metaphorical concepts are figurative. Examples are TIME IS MONEY, TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT, CONTROL IS UP, IDEAS ARE FOOD, THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS, etc. None of these is literal. This ((54)) is a consequence of the fact that only part of them is used to structure our normal concepts. Since they necessarily contain parts that are not used in our normal concepts, they go beyond the realm of the literal. Each of the metaphorical expressions we have talked about so far (e.g., the time will come; we construct a theory, attack an idea) is used within a whole system of metaphorical concepts—concepts that we constantly use in living and thinking. These expressions, like all other words and phrasal lexical items in the language, are fixed by convention. In addition to these cases, which are parts of whole metaphorical systems, there are idiosyncratic metaphorical expressions that stand alone and are not used systematically in our language or thought. These are well-known expressions like the foot of the mountain, a head of cabbage, the leg of a table, etc. These expressions are isolated instances of metaphorical concepts, where there is only one instance of a used part (or maybe two or three). Thus the foot of the mountain is the only used part of the metaphor A MOUNTAIN IS A PERSON. In normal discourse we do not speak of the head, shoulders, or trunk of a mountain, though in special contexts it is possible to construct novel metaphorical expressions based on these unused parts. In fact, there is an aspect of the metaphor A MOUNTAIN IS A PERSON in which mountain climbers will speak of the shoulder of a mountain (namely, a ridge near the top) and of conquering, fighting, and even being killed by a mountain. And there are cartoon conventions where mountains be-come animate and their peaks become heads. The point here is that there are metaphors, like A MOUNTAIN IS A PERSON, that are marginal in our culture and our language; their used part may consist of only one conventionally fixed expression of the language, and they do not systematically\ninteract with other metaphorical concepts because so little of them is used. This makes them relatively uninteresting for our purposes but not completely so, since they can be extended to their unused part in coining novel metaphorical ((55)) expressions, making jokes, etc. And our ability to extend them to unused parts indicates that, however marginal they are, they do exist. Examples like the foot of the mountain are idiosyncratic, unsystematic, and isolated. They do not interact with other metaphors, play no particularly interesting role in our conceptual system, and hence are not metaphors that we live by. The only signs of life they have is that they can be extended in subcultures and that their unused portions serve as the basis for (relatively uninteresting) novel metaphors. If any metaphorical expressions deserve to be called \"dead,\" it is these, though they do have a bare spark of life, in that they are understood partly in terms of marginal metaphorical concepts like A MOUNTAIN IS A PERSON. It is important to distinguish these isolated and un-systematic cases from the systematic metaphorical expressions we have been discussing. Expressions like wasting time, attacking positions, going our separate ways, etc., are reflections of systematic metaphorical concepts that structure our actions and thoughts. They are \"alive\" in the most fundamental sense: they are metaphors we live by. The fact that they are conventionally fixed within the lexicon of English makes them no less alive. ((56))\n12. How Is Our Conceptual System Grounded? We claim that most of our normal conceptual system is metaphorically structured; that is, most concepts are partially understood in terms of other concepts. This raises an important question about the grounding of our conceptual system. Are there any concepts at all that are understood directly, without metaphor? If not, how can we understand anything at all? The prime candidates for concepts that are understood directly are the simple spatial concepts, such as uP. Our spatial concept uP arises out of our spatial experience. We have bodies and we stand erect. Almost every movement we make involves a motor program that either changes our up-down orientation, maintains it, presupposes it, or takes it into account in some way. Our constant physical activity in the world, even when we sleep, makes an up-down orientation not merely relevant to our physical activity but centrally relevant. The centrality of up-down orientation in our motor programs and everyday functioning might make one think that there could be no alternative to this orientational concept. Objectively speaking, however, there are many possible frameworks for spatial orientation, including Cartesian coordinates, that don't in themselves have up-down orientation. Human spatial concepts, however, include UP-DOWN, FRONT-BACK, IN-OUT, NEAR-FAR, etc. It is these that are relevant to our continual everyday bodily functioning, and this gives them priority over other possible structurings of space—for us. In other words, the structure of our spatial concepts emerges from our constant spatial ((57)) experience, that is, our interaction with the physical environment. Concepts that emerge in this way are concepts that we live by in the most fundamental way. Thus uP is not understood purely in its own terms but emerges from the collection of constantly performed motor functions having to do with our erect position relative to the gravitational field we live in. Imagine a spherical being liv-ing outside any gravitational field, with no knowledge or imagination of any other kind of experience. What could uP possibly mean to such a being? The answer to this question would depend, not only on the physiology of this spherical being, but also on its culture. In other words, what we call \"direct physical experience\" is never merely a matter of having a body of a certain sort; rather, every experience takes place within a vast background of cultural\npresuppositions. It can be mislead-ing, therefore, to speak of direct physical experience as though there were some core of immediate experience which we then \"interpret\" in terms of our conceptual system. Cultural assumptions, values, and attitudes are not a conceptual overlay which we may or may not place upon experience as we choose. It would be more correct to say that all experience is cultural through and through, that we experience our \"world\" in such a way that our culture is already present in the very experience itself. However, even if we grant that every experience involves cultural presuppositions, we can still make the important distinction between experiences that are \"more\" physical, such as standing up, and those that are \"more\" cultural, such as participating in a wedding ceremony. When we speak of \"physical\" versus \"cultural\" experience in what follows, it is in this sense that we use the terms. Some of the central concepts in terms of which our bodies function—uP-DOWN, IN-OUT, FRONT- BACK, LIGHT-DARK, WARM-COLD, MALE-FEMALE, etc.—are more sharply delineated than others. While our emotional experience is ((58)) as basic as our spatial and perceptual experience, our emotional experiences are much less sharply delineated in terms of what we do with our bodies. Although a sharply delin- eated conceptual structure for space emerges from our perceptual-motor functioning, no sharply defined conceptual structure for the emotions emerges from our emotional functioning alone. Since there are systematic correlates between our emotions (like happiness) and our sensory-motor experiences (like erect posture), these form the basis of orientational metaphorical concepts (such as HAPPY IS UP). Such metaphors allow us to conceptualize our emotions in more sharply defined terms and also to relate them to other concepts having to do with general well-being (e.g., HEALTH, LIFE, CONTROL, etc.). In this sense, we can speak of emergent metaphors and emergent concepts. For example, the concepts OBJECT, SUBSTANCE, and CONTAINER emerge directly. We experience ourselves as entities, separate from the rest of the world—as containers with an inside and an outside. We also experience things external to us as entities—often also as containers with in-sides and outsides. We experience ourselves as being made up of substances—e.g., flesh and bone—and external objects as being made up of various kinds of substances--wood, stone, metal, etc. We experience many things, through sight and touch, as having distinct boundaries, and, when things have no distinct boundaries, we often project boundaries upon them—conceptualizing them as entities and often as containers (for example, forests, clearings, clouds, etc.). As in the case of orientational metaphors, basic ontologi-cal metaphors are grounded by virtue of systematic correlates within our experience. As we saw, for example, the metaphor THE VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER iS grounded in the correlation between what we see and a bounded physical space. The TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor is based on the correlation between an object moving toward us and\n((59)) the time it takes to get to us. The same correlation is a basis for the TIME Is A CONTAINER metaphor (as in \"He did it in ten minutes\"), with the bounded space traversed by the object correlated with the time the object takes to traverse it. Events and actions are correlated with bounded time spans, and this makes them CONTAINER OBJECTS. Experience with physical objects provides the basis for metonymy. Metonymic concepts emerge from correlations in our experience between two physical entities (e.g., PART FOR WHOLE, OBJECT FOR USER) or between a physical entity and something metaphorically conceptualized as a physical entity (e.g., THE PLACE FOR THE EVENT, THE INSTITUTION FOR THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE). Perhaps the most important thing to stress about grounding is the distinction between an experience and the way we conceptualize it. We are not claiming that physical experience is in any way more basic than other kinds of experience, whether emotional, mental, cultural, or what-ever. All of these experiences may be just as basic as physical experiences. Rather, what we are claiming about grounding is that we typically conceptualize the nonphysical in terms of the physical—that is, we conceptualize the less clearly delineated in terms of the more clearly delineated. Consider the following examples: Harry is in the kitchen. Harry is in the Elks. Harry is in love. The sentences refer to three different domains of experience: spatial, social, and emotional. None of these has experiential priority over the others; they are all equally basic kinds of experience. But with respect to conceptual structuring there is a difference. The concept IN of the first sentence emerges directly from spatial experience in a clearly delineated fashion. It is not an instance of a metaphorical concept. The other two sentences, however, are instances of metaphori- ((60)) cal concepts. The second is an instance of the SOCIAL GROUPS ARE CONTAINERS metaphor, in terms of which the concept of a social group is structured. This metaphor allows us to \"get a handle on\" the concept of a social group by means of a spatialization. The word \"in\" and the concept IN are the same in all three examples; we do not have three different concepts of IN or three homophonous words \"in.\" We have one emergent concept IN, one word for it, and two metaphorical concepts that partially define social groups and emotional states. What these cases show is that it is possible to have equally basic kinds of experiences while having conceptualizations of them that are not equally basic.\n((61))\n13. The Grounding of Structural Metaphors Metaphors based on simple physical concepts—up-down, in-out, object, substance, etc.— which are as basic as any-thing in our conceptual system and without which we could not function in the world—could not reason or communicate—are not in themselves very rich. To say that something is viewed as a CONTAINER OBJECT with an IN-OUT orientation does not say very much about it. But, as we saw with the MIND IS A MACHINE metaphor and the various personification metaphors, we can elaborate spatialization metaphors in much more specific terms. This allows us not only to elaborate a concept (like the MIND) in considerable detail but also to find appropriate means for highlighting some aspects of it and hiding others. Structural metaphors (such as RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR) provide the richest source of such elaboration. Structural metaphors allow us to do much more than just orient concepts, refer to them, quantify them, etc., as we do with simple orientational and onto-logical metaphors; they allow us, in addition, to use one highly structured and clearly delineated concept to structure another. Like orientational and ontological metaphors, structural metaphors are grounded in systematic correlations within our experience. To see what this means in detail, let us examine how the RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor might be grounded. This metaphor allows us to conceptualize what a rational argument is in terms of something that we understand more readily, namely, physical conflict. Fighting is found everywhere in the animal kingdom and ((62)) nowhere so much as among human animals. Animals fight to get what they want—food, sex, territory, control, etc.—because there are other animals who want the same thing or who want to stop them from getting it. The same is true of human animals, except that we have developed more sophisticated techniques for getting our way. Being \"rational animals,\" we have institutionalized our fighting in a number of ways, one of them being war. Even though we have over the ages institutionalized physical conflict and have employed many of our finest minds to develop more effective means of carrying it out, its basic structure remains essentially unchanged. In fights between two brute animals, scientists have observed the practices of issuing challenges for the sake of intimidation, of establishing and defending territory, attacking, defending, counterattacking, retreating, and surrendering. Human fighting involves the same practices. Part of being a rational animal, however, involves getting what you want without subjecting yourself to the dangers of actual physical conflict. As a result, we humans have evolved the social institution of verbal argument. We have arguments all the time in order\nto try to get what we want, and sometimes these \"degenerate\" into physical violence. Such verbal battles are comprehended in much the same terms as physical battles. Take a domestic quarrel, for in-stance. Husband and wife are both trying to get what each of them wants, such as getting the other to accept a certain viewpoint on some issue or at least to act according to that viewpoint. Each sees himself as having something to win and something to lose, territory to establish and territory to defend. In a no-holds-barred argument, you attack, defend, counterattack, etc., using whatever verbal means you have at your disposal—intimidation, threat, invoking authority, insult, belittling, challenging authority, evading issues, bar-gaining, flattering, and even trying to give \"rational reasons.\" But all of these tactics can be, and often are, presented as reasons; for example: ((63)) ...because I'm bigger than you. (intimidation) ... because if you don't, I'll ... (threat) ... because I'm the boss. (authority) ...because you're stupid. (insult) ...because you usually do it wrong. (belittling) ...because I have as much right as you do. (challenging authority) ...because I love you. (evading the issue) ... because if you will ... , I'll . (bargaining) ...because you're so much better at it. (flatten') Arguments that use tactics like these are the most common in our culture, and because they are so much a part of our daily lives, we sometimes don't notice them. However, there are important and powerful segments of our culture where such tactics are, at least in principle, frowned upon because they are considered to be \"irrational\" and \"un-fair.\" The academic world, the legal world, the diplomatic world, the ecclesiastical world, and the world of journalism claim to present an ideal, or \"higher,\" form of RATIONAL ARGUMENT, in which all of these tactics are forbidden. The only permissible tactics in this RATIONAL ARGUMENT are supposedly the stating of premises, the citing of supporting evidence, and the drawing of logical conclusions. But even in the most ideal cases, where all of these conditions hold, RATIONAl. ARGUMENT is still comprehended and carried out in terms of WAR. There is still a position to be established and defended, you can win or lose, you have an opponent whose position you attack and try to destroy and whose argument you try to shoot down. If you are completely successful, you can wipe him out. The point here is that not only our conception of an argument but the way we carry it out is grounded in our knowledge and experience of physical combat. Even if you have never fought a fistfight in you life, much less a war, but have been arguing from the time you began to talk, you still conceive of arguments, and execute them, according to the ((64)) ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor because the metaphor is built into the conceptual system of the culture in which you live. Not only are all the \"rational\" arguments that are assumed to actually live up to the ideal of RATIONAL ARGUMENT conceived of in terms of WAR, but almost all of them contain, in hidden form, the \"irrational\" and \"unfair\" tactics that rational arguments in their ideal form are supposed to transcend. Here are some typical examples: It is plausible to assume that.. . (intimidation) Clearly, ...\nObviously,. .. It would be unscientific to fail to ... (threat) To say that would be to commit the Fallacy of... As Descartes showed,. .. (authority) Hume observed that .. . Footnote 374: cf. Verschlugenheimer, 1954. The work lacks the necessary rigor for... (insult) Let us call such a theory \"Narrow\" Rationalism. In a display of \"scholarly objectivity,\" ... The work will not lead to a formalized theory. (belittling) His results cannot be quantified. Few people today seriously hold that view. Lest we succumb to the error of positivist approaches,. .. (challenging authority) Behaviorism has led to.. . He does not present any alternative theory. (evading the issue) But that is a matter of.. . The author does present some challenging facts, although .. . Your position is right as far as it goes, ... (bargaining) If one takes a realist point of view, one can accept the claim that... In his stimulating paper, ... (flattery) His paper raises some interesting issues . . . Examples like these allow us to trace the lineage of our rational argument back through \"irrational\" argument (= everyday arguing) to its origins in physical combat. The ((65)) tactics of intimidation, threat, appeal to authority, etc., though couched, perhaps, in more refined phrases, are just as present in rational argument as they are in everyday arguing and in war. Whether we are in a scientific, academic, or legal setting, aspiring to the ideal of rational argument, or whether we are just trying to get our way in our own house-hold by haggling, the way we conceive of, carry out, and describe our arguments is grounded in the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor. Let us now consider other structural metaphors that are important in our lives: LABOR IS A RESOURCE and TIME IS A RESOURCE. Both of these metaphors are culturally grounded in our experience with material resources. Material re-sources are typically raw materials or sources of fuel. Both are viewed as serving purposeful ends. Fuel may be used for heating, transportation, or the energy used in producing a finished product. Raw materials typically go directly into products. In both cases, the material resources can be quantified and given a value. In both cases, it is the kind of material as opposed to the particular piece or quantity of it that is important for achieving the purpose. For example, it doesn't matter which particular pieces of coal heat your house as long as they are the right kind of coal. In both cases, the material gets used up progressively as the pur-pose is served. To summarize: A material resource is a kind of substance can be quantified fairly precisely can be assigned a value per unit quantity serves a purposeful end is used up progressively as it serves its purpose Take the simple case where you make a product from raw material. It takes a certain amount of labor. In general, the more labor you perform, the more you produce. Assuming\nthat this is true—that the labor is proportional to the amount of product—we can assign value to the labor in ((66)) terms of the time it takes to produce a unit of product. The perfect model of this is the assembly line, where the raw material comes in at one end, labor is performed in progressive stages, whose duration is fixed by the speed of the line itself, and products come out at the other end. This pro-vides a grounding for the LABOR IS RESOURCE metaphor, as follows: LABOR iS a kind of activity (recall: AN ACTIVITY IS A SUB-STANCE) can be quantified fairly precisely (in terms of time) can be assigned a value per unit serves a purposeful end is used up progressively as it serves it purpose Since labor can be quantified in terms of time and usually is, in an industrial society, we get the basis for the TIME IS A RESOURCE metaphor: TIME is a kind of (abstract) SUBSTANCE can be quantified fairly precisely can be assigned a value per unit serves a purposeful end is used up progressively as it serves its purpose When we are living by the metaphors LABOR IS A RESOURCE and TIME IS A RESOURCE, as we do in our culture, we tend not to see them as metaphors at all. But, as the above account of their grounding in experience shows, both are structural metaphors that are basic to Western industrial societies. These two complex structural metaphors both employ simple ontological metaphors. LABOR IS A RESOURCE uses AN ACTIVITY IS A SUBSTANCE. TIME IS A RESOURCE uses TIME IS A SUBSTANCE. These two SUBSTANCE metaphors permit labor and time to be quantified—that is, measured, conceived of as being progressively \"used up,\" and as-signed monetary values; they also allow us to view time and labor as things that can be \"used\" for various ends. ((67)) LABOR IS A RESOURCE and TIME IS A RESOURCE are by no means universal. They emerged naturally in our culture be-cause of the way we view work, our passion for quantification, and our obsession with purposeful ends. These metaphors\nhighlight those aspects of labor and time that are centrally important in our culture. In doing this, they also deemphasize or hide certain aspects of labor and time. We can see what both metaphors hide by examining what they focus on. In viewing labor as a kind of activity, the metaphor assumes that labor can be clearly identified and distinguished from things that are not labor. It makes the assumptions that we can tell work from play and productive activity from nonproductive activity. These assumptions obviously fail to fit reality much of the time, except perhaps on assembly lines, chain gangs, etc. The view of labor as merely a kind of activity, independent of who performs it, how he experiences it, and what it means in his life, hides the issues of whether the work is personally meaningful, satisfying, and humane. The quantification of labor in terms of time, together with the view of time as serving a purposeful end, induces a notion of LEISURE TIME, which is parallel to the concept LABOR TIME. In a society like ours, where inactivity is not considered a purposeful end, a whole industry devoted to leisure activity has evolved. As a result, LEISURE TIME becomes a RESOURCE too—to be spent productively, used wisely, saved up, budgeted, wasted, lost, etc. What is hidden by the RESOURCE metaphors for labor and time is the way our concepts of LABOR and -LIME affect our concept of LEISURE, turning it into some-thing remarkably like LABOR. The RESOURCE metaphors for labor and time hide all sorts of possible conceptions of labor and time that exist in other cultures and in some subcultures of our own society: the idea that work can be play, that inactivity can be productive, that much of what we classify as LABOR serves either no clear purpose or no worthwhile purpose. The three structural metaphors we have considered in ((68)) this Section—RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR, LABOR IS A RE-SOURCE, and TIME IS A RESOURCE—all have a strong cultural basis. They emerged naturally in a culture like ours because what they highlight corresponds so closely to what we experience collectively and what they hide corresponds to so little. But not only are they grounded in our physical and cultural experience; they also influence our experience and our actions.\n((69))\n14. Causation: Partly Emergent and Partly Metaphorical We have seen in our discussion of grounding that there are directly emergent concepts (like UP-DOWN, IN-OUT, OBJECT, SUBSTANCE, etc.) and emergent metaphorical concepts based on our experience (like THE VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER, AN ACTIVITY IS A CONTAINER, etc.). From the limited range of examples we have considered, it might seem as if there were a clear distinction between directly emergent and metaphorically emergent concepts and that every concept must be one or the other. This is not the case. Even a concept as basic as CAUSATION iS not purely emergent or purely metaphorical. Rather, it appears to have a directly emergent core that is elaborated metaphorically. Direct Manipulation: The Prototype of Causation Standard theories of meaning assume that all of our complex concepts can be analyzed into undecomposable primitives. Such primitives are taken to be the ultimate \"building blocks\" of meaning. The concept of causation is often taken to be such an ultimate building block. We believe that the standard theories are fundamentally mistaken in assuming that basic concepts are undecomposable primitives. We agree that causation is a basic human concept. It is one of the concepts most often used by people to organize their physical and cultural realities. But this does not mean that it is an undecomposable primitive. We would like to suggest instead that causation is best understood as an ((70)) experiential gestalt. A proper understanding of causation requires that it be viewed as a cluster of other components. But the cluster forms a gestalt—a whole that we human beings find more basic than the parts. We can see this most clearly in infants. Piaget has hypothesized that infants first learn about causation by realizing that they can directly manipulate objects around them—pull off their blankets, throw their bottles, drop toys. There is, in fact, a stage in which infants seem to \"practice\" these manipulations, e.g., they repeatedly drop their spoons. Such direct manipulations, even on the part of\ninfants, involve certain shared features that characterize the notion of direct causation that is so integral a part of our constant everyday functioning in our environment—as when we flip light switches, button our shirts, open doors, etc. Though each of these actions is different, the over- whelming proportion of them share features of what we may call a \"prototypical\" or \"paradigmatic\" case of direct causation. These shared features include: The agent has as a goal some change of state in the patient. The change of state is physical. The agent has a \"plan\" for carrying out this goal. The plan requires the agent's use of a motor program. The agent is in control of that motor program. The agent is primarily responsible for carrying out the plan. The agent is the energy source (i.e., the agent is directing his energies toward the patient), and the patient is the energy goal (i.e., the change in the patient is due to an external source of energy). The agent touches the patient either with his body or an instrument (i.e., there is a spatiotemporal overlap between what the agent does and the change in the patient). The agent successfully carries out the plan. The change in the patient is perceptible. The agent monitors the change in the patient through sensory perception. ((71)) There is a single specific agent and a single specific patient. This set of properties characterizes \"prototypical\" direct manipulations, and these are cases of causation par excellence. We are using the word \"prototypical\" in the sense Rosch uses it in her theory of human categorization (1977). Her experiments indicate that people categorize objects, not in set-theoretical terms, but in terms of prototypes and family resemblances. For example, small flying singing birds, like sparrows, robins, etc., are prototypical birds. Chickens, ostriches, and penguins are birds but are not central members of the category—they are nonprototypical birds. But they are birds nonetheless, because they bear sufficient family resemblances to the prototype; that is, they share enough of the relevant properties of the pro-totype to be classified by people as birds. The twelve properties given above characterize a pro-totype of causation in the following sense. They recur together over and over in action after action as we go through our daily lives. We experience them as a gestalt, that is, the complex of properties occurring together is more basic to our experience than their separate occurrence. Through their constant recurrence in our everyday functioning, the category of causation emerges with this complex of properties characterizing prototypical causations. Other kinds of causation, which are less prototypical, are actions or events that bear sufficient family resemblances to the pro-totype. These would include action at a distance, nonhuman agency, the use of an intermediate agent, the occurrence of two or more agents, involuntary or uncontrolled use of the motor program, etc. (In physical causation the agent and patient are events, a physical law takes the place of plan, goal, and motor activity, and all of the peculiarly human aspects are factored out.) When there is an insufficient family resemblance to the prototype, we cease to characterize what happens as causation. For example, if there were multiple agents, if what the agents did was re-mote in space and time from the patient's change, and if\n((72)) there were neither desire nor plan nor control, then we probably wouldn't say that this was an instance of causa-tion, or at least we would have questions about it. Although the category of causation has fuzzy boundaries, it is clearly delineated in an enormous range of instances. Our successful functioning in the world involves the appli- cation of the concept of causation to ever new domains of activity—through intention, planning, drawing inferences, etc. The concept is stable because we continue to function successfully in terms of it. Given a concept of causation that emerges from our experience, we can apply that concept to metaphorical concepts. In \"Harry raised our morale by telling jokes,\" for example, we have an instance of causation where what Harry did made our morale go uP, as in the HAPPY IS UP metaphor. Though the concept of causation as we have characterized it is basic to human activity, it is not a \"primitive\" in the usual building-block sense, that is, it is not unanalyzable and undecomposable. Since it is defined in terms of a prototype that is characterized by a recurrent complex of properties, our concept of causation is at once holistic, analyzable into those properties, and capable of a wide range of variation. The terms into which the causation pro-totype is analyzed (e.g., control, motor program, volition, etc.) are probably also characterized by prototype and capable of further analysis. This permits us to have concepts that are at once basic, holistic, and indefinitely analyzable. Metaphorical Extensions of Prototypical Causation Simple instances of making an object (e.g., a paper airplane, a snowball, a sand castle) are all special cases of direct causation. They all involve prototypical direct manipulation, with all of the properties listed above. But they have one additional characteristic that sets them apart as instances of making: As a result of the manipulation, we ((73)) view the object as a different kind of thing. What was a sheet of paper is now a paper airplane. We categorize it differently—it has a different form and function. It is essentially this that sets instances of tnakin,g apart from other kinds of direct manipulation. Even a simple change of state, like the change from water to ice, can be viewed as an instance of making, since ice has a different form and function than water. Thus we get examples like: You can make ice out of water by freezing it. This parallels examples like: I made a paper airplane out of a sheet of newspaper. I made a statue out of clay. We conceptualize changes of this kind—from one state into another, having a new form and function—in terms of the metaphor THE OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE.\nThis is why the expression out of is used in the above examples: the ice is viewed as emerging out of the water; the airplane is viewed as emerging out of the paper; the statue is viewed as emerging out of the clay. In a sentence like \"I made a statue out of clay,\" the substance clay is viewed as the CONTAINER (via the SUBSTANCE IS A CON- TAINER metaphor) from which the object—namely, the statue—emerges. Thus the concept MAKING iS partly, but not totally, metaphorical. That is, MAKING iS an instance of a directly emergent concept, namely, DIRECT MANIPULATION, which is further elaborated by the metaphor THE OB- J1:CT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE. Another way we can conceptualize making is by elaborating on direct manipulation, using another metaphor: THE SUBSTANCE GOES INTO THE OBJECT. Thus: I made a sheet of newspaper into an airplane. I made the clay you gave me into a statue. Here the object is viewed as a container for the material. The SUBSTANCE GOES INTO THE OBJECT metaphor occurs ((74)) far more widely than in the concept of MAKING. We conceptualize a wide range of changes, natural as well as man-made, in terms of this metaphor. For example: The water turned into ice. The caterpillar turned into a butterfly. She is slowly changing into a beautiful woman. The OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE metaphor is also used outside the concept of MAKING but in a much more limited range of circumstances, mostly those having to do with evolution: Mammals developed out of reptiles. Our present legal system evolved out of English common law. Thus the two metaphors we use to elaborate direct manipulation into the concept of MAKING are both used independently to conceptualize various concepts of CHANGE. These two metaphors for CHANGE, which are used as part of the concept of MAKING, emerge naturally from as fundamental a human experience as there is, namely, birth. In birth, an object (the baby) comes out of a container (the mother). At the same time, the mother's substance (her flesh and blood) are in the baby (the container object). The experience of birth (and also agricultural growth) provides a grounding for the general concept of CREATION, which has as its core the concept of MAKING a physical object but which extends to abstract entities as well. We can see this grounding in birth metaphors for creation in general: Our nation was born out of a desire for freedom. His writings are products of his, fertile\nimagination. His experiment spawned a host of new theories. Your actions will only breed violence. He hatched a clever scheme. He conceived a brilliant theory of molecular motion. Universities are incubators for new ideas. The theory of relativity first saw the light of in 1905. ((75)) The University of Chicago was the birthplace of the nuclear age. Edward Teller is the father of the hydrogen bomb. These are all instances of the general metaphor CREATION IS BIRTH. This gives us another instance where a special case of causation is conceptualized metaphorically. Finally, there is another special case of CAUSATION which we conceptualize in terms of the EMERGENCE metaphor. This is the case where a mental or emotional state is viewed as causing an act or event: He shot the mayor out of desperation. He gave up his career out of love for his family. His mother nearly went crazy from loneliness. He dropped from exhaustion. He became a mathematician out of a passion for order. Here the STATE (desperation, loneliness, etc.) is viewed as a container, and the act or event is viewed as an object that emerges from the container. The CAUSATION iS viewed as the EMERGENCE of the EVENT from the STATE. Summary As we have just seen, the concept of CAUSATION iS based on the prototype of DIRECT MANIPULATION, which emerges directly from our experience. The prototypical core is elaborated by metaphor to yield a broad concept of CAUSA-TION, which has many special cases. The metaphors used are THE OBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE, THE SUB-STANCE GOES INTO THE OBJECT, CREATION IS BIRTH, and CAUSATION (of event by state) Is EMERGENCE (of the event/object from the state/container). We also saw that the prototypical core of the concept CAUSATION, namely, DIRECT MANIPULATION, iS not an un- analyzable semantic primitive but rather a gestalt consisting of properties that naturally occur together in our daily experience of performing direct manipulations. The pro- ((76))\ntotypical concept DIRECT MANIPULATION 1S basic and primitive in our experience, but not in the sense required by a \"building-block\" theory. In such theories, each concept either is an ultimate building block or can be broken down into ultimate building blocks in one and only one way. The theory we will propose in the next chapter suggests, in-stead, that there are natural dimensions of experience and that concepts can be analyzed along these dimensions in more than one way. Moreover, along each dimension, concepts can often be analyzed further and further, relative to our experience, so that there are not always ultimate build-ing blocks. Thus there are three ways in which CAUSATION is not an unanalyzable primitive: —It is characterized in terms of family resemblances to the prototype of DIRECT MANIPUl Al ION. —The DIRECT MANIPULATION prototype itself is an indefinitely analyzable gestalt of naturally cooccurring properties. —The prototypical core of CAUSATION iS elaborated metaphorically in various ways. ((77)) 15 The Coherent Structuring of Experience Experiential Gestalts and the Dimensions of Experience We have talked throughout of metaphorical concepts as ways of partially structuring one experience in terms of another. In order to see in detail what is involved in metaphorical structuring, we must first have a clearer idea of what it means for an experience or set of experiences to be coherent by virtue of having a structure. For example, we have suggested that an argument is a conversation that is partially structured by the concept WAR (thus giving us the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor). Suppose you are having a conversation and you suddenly realize that it has turned into an argument. What is it that makes a conversation an argument, and what does that have to do with war? To see the difference between a conversation and an argument, we first have to see what it means to be engaged in a conversation.\nThe most basic kind of conversation involves two people who are talking to each other. Typically, one of them initiates it and they take turns talking about some common topic or set of topics. Maintaining the turn-taking and keeping to the topic at hand (or shifting topics in a permissible fashion) takes a certain amount of cooperation. And whatever other purposes a conversation may have for the participants, conversations generally serve the purpose of polite social interaction. Even in as simple a case as a polite two-party conversation, several dimensions of structure can be seen: ((78)) Participants: The participants are of a certain natural kind, namely, people. Here they take the role of speakers. The conversation is defined by what the participants do, and the same participants play a role throughout the conversation. Parts: The parts consist of a certain natural kind of activity, namely, talking. Each turn at talking is a part of the conversation as a whole, and these parts must be put together in a certain fashion for there to be a coherent conversation. Stages: Conversations typically have a set of initial conditions and then pass through various stages, including at least a be-ginning, a central part, and an end. Thus there are certain things that are said in order to initiate a conversation (\"Hello!\", \"How are you?\", etc.), others that move it along to the central part, and still others that end it. Linear sequence: The participants' turns at speaking are ordered in a linear sequence, with the general constraint that the speakers alternate. Certain overlappings are permitted, and there are lapses where one speaker doesn't take his turn and the other speaker continues. Without such constraints on linear sequencing of parts, you get a monologue or a jumble of words but no conversation. Causation: The finish of one turn at talking is expected to result in the beginning of the next turn. Purpose: Conversations may serve any number of purposes, but all typical conversations share the purpose of maintaining polite social interaction in a reasonably cooperative manner. There are many details that could be added that characterize conversation more precisely, but these six dimensions of structure give the main outlines of what is common to typical conversations. If you are engaged in a conversation (which has at least these six dimensions of structure) and you perceive it turn-ing into an argument, what is it that you perceive over and above being in a conversation? The basic difference is a sense of being embattled. You realize that you have an opinion that matters to you and that the other person doesn't accept it. At least one participant wants the other to\n((79)) give up his opinion, and this creates a situation where there is something to be won or lost. You sense that you are in an argument when you find your own position under attack or when you feel a need to attack the other person's position. It becomes a full-fledged argument when both of you devote most of your conversational energy to trying to discredit the other person's position while maintaining your own. The argument remains a conversation, although the element of polite cooperation in maintaining the conversational structure may be strained if the argument becomes heated. The sense of being embattled comes from experiencing yourself as being in a warlike situation even though it is not actual combat—since you are maintaining the amenities of conversation. You experience the other participant as an adversary, you attack his position, you try to defend your own, and you do what you can to make him give in. The structure of the conversation takes on aspects of the structure of a war, and you act accordingly. Your perceptions and actions correspond in part to the perceptions and actions of a party engaged in war. We can see this in more detail in the following list of characteristics of argument: You have an opinion that matters to you. (having a position) The other participant does not agree with your opinion. (has a different position) It matters to one or both of you that the other give up his opinion (surrender) and accept yours (victory). (he is your adversay) The difference of opinion becomes a conflict of opinions. (conflict) You think of how you can best convince him of your view (plan strategy) and consider what evidence you can bring to bear on the issue (marshal forces). Considering what you perceive as the weaknesses of his position, you ask questions and raise objections designed to force him ultimately to give up his position and adopt yours. (attack) ((80)) You try to change the premises of the conversation so that you will be in a stronger position. (maneuvering) In response to his questions and objections, you try to maintain your own position. (defense) As the argument progresses, maintaining your general view may require some revision. (retreat) You may raise new questions and objections. (counterattack) Either you get tired and decide to quit arguing (truce), or neither of you can convince the other (stalemate), or one of you gives in. (surrender) What gives coherence to this list of things that make a conversation into an argument is that they correspond to elements of the concept WAR. What is added from the concept WAR to the concept CONVERSATION can be viewed in terms of the same six dimensions of structure that we gave in our description of conversational structure. Participants: The kind of participants are people or groups of people. They play the role of adversaries. Parts: The two positions Planning strategy Attack Defense\nRetreat Maneuvering Counterattack Stalemate Truce Surrender/victory Stages: Initial conditions: Beginning: One Middle: Combinations of defense maneuvering Participants have different positions. One or both wants the other to surren-der. Each participant assumes he can defend his position. adversary attacks. ((81)) retreat counterattack End: Either truce or stalemate or surrender/ victory Final state: Peace, victor has dominance over loser Linear sequence: Retreat after attack Defense after attack Counterattack after attack Causation: Attack results in defense or counterattack or retreat or end. Purpose: Victory Understanding a conversation as being an argument involves being able to superimpose the multidimensional structure of part of the concept WAR upon the correspond-ing structure CONVERSATION. Such multidimensional structures characterize experiential gestalts, which are ways of organizing experiences into structured wholes. In the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor, the gestalt for CONVERSATION IS structured further by means of correspondences with selected elements of the gestalt for WAR. Thus one activity, talking, is understood in terms of another, physical fighting. Structuring our experience in terms of such multidimensional gestalts is what makes our experience coherent. We experience a conversation as an argument when the WAR gestalt fits our perceptions and actions in the conversation. Understanding such multidimensional gestalts and the correlations between them is the key to understanding coherence in our experience. As we saw above, experiential gestalts are multidimensional structured wholes. Their dimensions, in turn, are defined in terms of directly emergent concepts. That is, the various dimensions (participants, parts, stages, etc.) are categories that emerge naturally from our experience. We have already seen that CAUSATION is a directly emergent concept, and the other dimensions in ((82)) terms of which we categorize our experience have a fairly obvious experiential basis:\nParticipants: This dimension arises out of the concept of the sELF as an actor distinguishable from the actions he performs. We also distinguish kinds of participants (e.g., people, animals, objects). Parts: We experience ourselves as having parts (arms, legs, etc.) that we can control independently. Likewise, we experience physical objects either in terms of parts that they naturally have or parts that we impose upon them, either by virtue of our perceptions, our interactions with them, or our uses for them. Similarly, we impose a part-whole structure on events and activities. And, as in the case of participants, we distinguish kinds of parts (e.g., kinds of objects, kinds of activities, etc.). Stages: Our simplest motor functions involve knowing where we are and what position we are in (initial conditions), starting to move (beginning), carrying out the motor function (middle), and stopping (end), which leaves us in a final state. Linear sequence: Again, the control of our simplest motor functions requires us to put them in the right linear sequence. Purpose: From birth (and even before), we have needs and desires, and we realize very early that we can perform certain actions (crying, moving, manipulating objects) to satisfy them. These are some of the basic dimensions of our experience. We classify our experiences in such terms. And we see coherence in diverse experiences when we can categorize them in terms of gestalts with at least these dimensions. What Does It Mean for a Concept to Fit an Experience? Let us return to the experience of being in a conversation that turns into an argument. As we saw, being in a conversation is a structured experience. As we experience a conversation, we are automatically and unconsciously classifying our experience in terms of the natural dimensions of ((83)) the CONVERSATION gestalt: Who's participating? Whose turn is it? (= which part?) What stage are we at? And so on. It is in terms of imposing the CONVERSATION gestalt on what is happening that we experience the talking and listening that we engage in as a particular kind of experience, namely, a conversation. When we perceive dimensions of our experience as fitting the WAR gestalt in addition, we become aware that we are participating in another kind of experience, namely, an argument. It is by this means that we classify particular experiences, and we need to classify our experiences in order to comprehend, so that we will know what to do. Thus we classify particular experiences in terms of experiential gestalts in our conceptual system. Here we must distinguish between: (1) the experience itself, as we structure it, and (2) the concepts that we employ in structuring it, that is, the multidimensional gestalts like CONVERSATION and ARGUMENT. The concept (say, CONVERSATION) specifies certain natural dimensions (e.g., participants, parts, stages, etc.) and how these dimensions are related. There is a correlation, dimension by dimension, between the concept CONVERSATION and the aspects of the actual activity of conversing. This is what we mean when we say that a concept fits an experience. It is by means of conceptualizing our experiences in this manner that we pick out the \"important\" aspects of an experience. And by picking out what is \"important\" in the experience, we can categorize the experience, understand it, and remember it. If we were to\ntell you that we had an argument yesterday, we would be telling you the truth if our concept of an ARGUMENT, with us as participants, fits an experience that we had yesterday, dimension by dimension. Metaphorical Structuring versus Subcategorization In our discussion of the concept ARGUMENT, we have been assuming a clear-cut distinction between subcategorization ((84)) and metaphorical structuring. On the one hand, we took \"An argument is a conversation\" to be an instance of sub-categorization, because an argument is basically a kind of conversation. The same kind of activity occurs in both, namely, talking, and an argument has all the basic structural features of a conversation. Thus our criteria for sub- categorization were (a) same kind of activity and (b) enough of the same structural features. On the other hand, we took ARGUMENT IS WAR to be a metaphor because an argument and a war are basically different kinds of activity, and ARGUMENT is partially structured in terms of WAR. Argument is a different kind of activity because it involves talking instead of combat. The structure is partial, because only selected elements of the concept WAR are used. Thus our criteria for metaphor were (a) a difference in kind of activity and (h) partial structuring (use of certain selected parts). But we cannot always distinguish subcategorization from metaphor on the basis of these criteria. The reason is that it is not always clear when two activities (or two things) are of the same kind or of different kinds. Take, for example, AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT. Is this a subcategorization or a metaphor? The issue here is whether fighting and arguing are the same kind of activity. This is not a simple issue. Fighting is an attempt to gain dominance that typically involves hurting, inflicting pain, injuring, etc. But there is both physical pain and what is called psychological pain; there is physical dominance and there is psychological dominance. If your concept FIGHT includes psychological dominance and psychological pain on a par with physical dominance and pain, then you may see AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT as a subcategorization rather than a metaphor, since both would involve gaining psychological dominance. On this view an argument would be a kind of fight, structured in the form of a conversation. If, on the other hand, you conceive of FIGHT as purely physical, and if you view psycho-logical pain only as pain taken metaphorically, then you might view AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT as metaphorical. ((85))\nThe point here is that subcategorization and metaphor are endpoints on a continuum. A relationship of the form A is B (for example, AN ARGUMENT IS A FIGHT) will be a clear subcategorization if A and B are the same kind of thing or activity and will be a clear metaphor if they are clearly different kinds of things or activities. But when it is not clear whether A and B are the same kind of thing or activity, then the relationship A is B falls somewhere in the middle of the continuum. The important thing to note is that the theory outlined in chapter 14 allows for such unclear cases as well as for the clear ones. The unclear cases will involve the same kinds of structures (with the same dimensions and the same possible complexities) as the clear cases. In an unclear case of the form A is B, A and B will both be gestalts that structure certain kinds of activities (or things), and the only question will be whether the activities or things structured by those gestalts are of the same kind. We have so far characterized coherence in terms of experiential gestalts, which have various dimensions that emerge naturally from experience. Some gestalts are relatively simple (CONVERSATION) and some are extremely elaborate (wAR). There are also complex gestalts, which are structured partially in terms of other gestalts. These are what we have been calling metaphorically structured concepts. Certain concepts are structured almost entirely metaphorically. The concept LOVE, for example, is structured mostly in metaphorical terms: LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS A PATIENT, LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE, LOVE IS MADNESS, LOVE IS WAR, etc. The concept of LOVE has a core that is minimally structured by the subcategorization LOVE IS AN EMOTION and by links to other emotions, e.g., liking. This is typical of emotional concepts, which are not clearly delineated in our experience in any direct fashion and therefore must be comprehended primarily in-directly, via metaphor. But there is more to coherence than structuring in terms ((86)) of multidimensional gestalts. When a concept is structured by more than one metaphor, the different metaphorical structurings usually fit together in a coherent fashion. We will now turn to other aspects of coherence, both within a single metaphorical structuring and across two or more metaphors.\n((87)) 16. Metaphorical Coherence Specialized Aspects of a Concept So far we have looked at the concept ARGUMENT in enough detail to get a sense of its general overall structure. As is the case with many of our general concepts, the concept ARGUMENT has specialized aspects that are used in certain subcultures or in certain situations. We saw, for example, that in the academic world, legal world, etc., the concept ARGUMENT is specialized to RATIONAL ARGUMENT, which is distinguished from everyday, \"irrational\" argument. In RATIONAl. ARGUMENT the tactics are ideally restricted to stating premises, citing supporting evidence, and drawing logical conclusions. In practice, as we saw, the tactics of everyday argument (intimidation, appeal to authority, etc.) appear in actual \"rational\" argument in a disguised or refined form. These additional restrictions define RATIONAL ARGUMENT as a specialized branch of the general concept ARGUMENT. Moreover, the purpose of argument is further restricted in the case of RATIONAL ARGUMENT. In the ideal case, the purpose of winning the argument is seen as serv-ing the higher purpose of understanding. Within RATIONAL ARGUMENT itself there is a further specialization. Since written discourse rules out the dialogue inherent in two-party arguments, a special form of one-party argument has developed. Here speaking typically be-comes writing, and the author addresses himself, not to an actual adversary, but to a set of hypothetical adversaries or to actual adversaries who are not present to defend them-selves, counterattack, etc. What we have here is the spe- cialized concept ONE-PARTY RATIONAL ARGUMENT.\n((88)) Finally, there is a distinction between an argument as a process (arguing) and an argument as a product (what has been written or said in the course of arguing). In this case, the process and the product are intimately related aspects of the same general concept, neither of which can exist without the other, and either of which can be focused on. Thus we speak of the stage of an argument as applying indifferently to the process or the product. A ONE-PARTY RATIONAL ARGUMENT iS a specialized branch of the general concept ARGUMENT and, as such, has many special constraints on it. Since there is no particular adversary present, an idealized adversary must be assumed. If the purpose of victory is to be maintained, it must be victory over an idealized adversary who is not present. The only way to guarantee victory is to be able to overcome all possible adversaries and to win neutral parties over to your side. To do this, you have to anticipate possible objections, defenses, attacks, etc., and deal with them as you construct your argument. Since this is a RATIONAL ARGUMENT, all of these steps must be taken, not just to win, but in the service of the higher purpose of understanding. The further restrictions placed on one-party rational arguments require us to pay special attention to certain aspects of argument which are not so important (or perhaps not even present) in everyday argument. Among them are: Content: You have to have enough supporting evidence and say enough of the right things in order to make your point and to overcome any possible objections. Progress: You have to start with generally agreed upon premises and move in linear fashion toward some conclusion. Structure: RATIONAL ARGUMENT requires appropriate logical connections among the various parts. Strength: The ability of the argument to withstand assault de-pends on the weight of the evidence and the tightness of the logical connections. ((89)) Basicness: Some claims are more important to maintain and defend than others, since subsequent claims will be based upon them. Obviousness: In any argument there will be things which are not obvious. These need to be identified and explored in sufficient detail. Directness: The force of an argument can depend on how straightforwardly you move from premises to conclusions. Clarity: What you are claiming and the connections between your claims must be sufficiently clear for the reader to under-stand them. These are aspects of a one-party rational argument that are not necessarily present in an ordinary everyday argument. The concept CONVERSATION and the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor do not focus on these aspects, which are crucial to idealized RATIONAL ARGUMENT. As a result, the concept RATIONAL ARGUMENT iS further defined by means of other metaphors which do enable us to focus on these important aspects: AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY, AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER, and AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING. As we will see, each of these gives us a handle on some of the above aspects of the concept RATIONAL ARGUMENT. No one of them is sufficient to give us a complete, consistent, and comprehensive understanding of all these aspects, but together they do the job of giving us a coherent\nunderstanding of what a rational argument is. We will now take up the question of what it means for various different metaphors, each of which partially structures a concept, to jointly provide a coherent understanding of the concept as a whole. Coherence within a Single Metaphor We can get some idea of the mechanism of coherence within a single metaphorical structuring by starting with the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY. This metaphor has ((90)) to do with the goal of the argument, the fact that it must have a beginning, proceed in a linear fashion, and make progress in stages toward that goal. Here are some obvious instances of the metaphor: AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY We have set out to prove that bats are birds. When we get to the next point, we shall see that philosophy is dead. So far, we've seen that no current theories will work. We will proceed in a step-by-step fashion. Our goal is to show that hummingbirds are essential to military defense. This observation points the way to an elegant solution. We have arrived at a disturbing conclusion. One thing we know about journeys is that a JOURNEY DE- FINES A PATH. A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH He strayed from the path. He's gone offin the wrong direction. They're, following us. I'm lost. Putting together AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY and A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH, we get: AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH He strayed from the line of argument Do you follow my argument? Now we've gone off in the wrong direction again. I'm lost. You're going around in circles. Moreover, paths are conceived of as surfaces (think of a carpet unrolling as you go along, thus creating a path behind you): THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE We covered a lot of ground. He's on our trail. ((91))\nHe strayed off the trail. We went back over the same trail. Given that AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH and THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE, we get: THE PATH OF AN ARGUMENT IS A SURFACE We have already covered those points. We have covered a lot of ground in our argument. Let's go back over the argument again. You're getting off the subject. You're really onto something there. We're well on our Iraq to solving this problem. Here we have a set of cases that fall under the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY. What makes them systematic is a pair of metaphorical entailments that are based on two facts about journeys. The facts about journeys: A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE The metaphorical entailments: AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH__Therefore, AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY THE PATH OF A JOURNEY IS A SURFACE __________________ Therefore, THE PATH OF AN ARGUMENT IS A SURFACE Here metaphorical entailments characterize the internal systematicity of the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY, that is, they make coherent all the examples that fall under that metaphor. Coherence between Two Aspects of a Single Concept AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY is Only One of the metaphOrS for arguments, the one we use to highlight or talk about the ((92)) goal, direction, or progress of an argument. When we want to talk about the content of an argument, we use the struc- turally complex metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER. Containers can be viewed as defining a limited space (with a bounding surface, a center, and a periphery) and as holding a substance (which may vary in amount, and which may have a core located in the center). We use the ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER metaphor when we want to highlight any of these aspects of an argument. AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER Your argument doesn't have much content. That argument has holes in it.\nYou don't have much at' an argument, but his objections have even less substance. Your argument is vacuous. I'm tired of your empty arguments. You won't find that idea in his argument. That conclusion falls out o/' my argument. Your argument won't hold mater. Those points are central to the argument—the rest is peripheral. I still haven't gotten to the core of his argument. Since the purposes of the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors are different, that is, since they are used to focus in detail on different aspects of an argument (goal and progress versus content), we would not expect these metaphors to overlap completely. It is possible in some cases to focus jointly on both the JOURNEY (progress) and CONTAINER (content) aspects of an argument. Thus we get certain mixed metaphors that display both of these aspects at once. Overlap between JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors: At this point our argument doesn't have much content. In what we've done solar, we have provided the core of our argument. If we keep going the way we're going, we'll fit all the facts in. What makes this overlap possible is that the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors have shared entailments. Both ((93)) metaphors allow us to distinguish the form of the argument from the content. In the JOURNEY metaphor, the path corresponds to the form of the argument and the ground covered corresponds to the content. When we are going around in circles, we may have a long path, but we don't cover much ground; that is, the argument doesn't have much content. In a good argument, however, each element of form is used to express some content. In the JOURNEY metaphor, the longer the path (the longer the argument), the more ground is covered (the more content the argument has). In the CONTAINER metaphor, the bounding surface of the container corresponds to the form of the argument, and what is in the container corresponds to the \"content\" of the argument. In a container that is designed and used most efficiently, all of the bounding surface is used to hold content. Ideally, the more surface there is (the longer the argument), the more substance there is in the container (the more content the argument has). As the path of the journey unfolds, more and more of the surface defined by that path is created, just as more and more of the surface of the container is created. The overlap between the two metaphors is the progressive creation of a surface. As the argument covers more ground (via the JOURNEY surface), it gets more content (via the CONTAINER surface). What characterizes this overlap is a shared entailment that arises in the following way. A nonmetaphorical entailment about journeys: As we make a journey, more of a path is created. A PATH IS A SURFACE. ___________________________________________\nTherefore, As we make a journey, more of a surface is created. A metaphorical entailment about arguments (based on jour- neys): AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY. As we make a journey,more of a surface is created. Therefore, As we make an argument, more of a surface is created. ((94)) A metaphorical entailment about arguments (based on con- tainers): AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER. Aswe make a container, more of a surface is created. Therefore, As we make an argument, more of a surface is created. Here the two metaphorical entailments have the same conclusion. This can be represented by the accompanying dia-gram. AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER Other entailments As we make an argument, more of a surface is created. Other entailments As more of a ti As more of a surface is created, surface is created, the argument covers the argument gets more ground. more content. It is this overlap of entailments between the two metaphors that defines the coherence between them and provides the link between the amount of ground the argument covers and the amount of content it has. This is what allows them to \"fit together,\" even though they are not completely consistent, that is, there is no \"single image\" that completely fits both metaphors. The surface of a container and the surface of the ground are both surfaces by virtue of common topological properties. But our image of ground sur-face is very different than our images of various kinds of container surfaces. The abstract topological concept of a surface which forms the overlap between these two metaphors is not concrete enough to form an image. In general when metaphors are coherent but not consistent, we should not expect them to form consistent images. The difference between coherence and consistency is\n((95)) crucial. Each metaphor focuses on one aspect of the concept ARGUMENT: In this, each serves a single purpose. Moreover, each metaphor allows us to understand one aspect of the concept in terms of a more clearly delineated concept, e.g., JOURNEY or CONTAINER. The reason we need two metaphors is because there is no one metaphor that will do the job— there is no one metaphor that will allow us to get a handle simultaneously on both the direction of the argument and the content of the argument. These two pur-poses cannot both be served at once by a single metaphor. And where the purposes won't mix, the metaphors won't mix. Thus we get instances of impermissible mixed metaphors resulting from the impossibility of a single clearly delineated metaphor that satisfies both purposes at once. For example, we can speak of the direction of the argument and of the content of the argument but not of the direction of the content of the argument nor of the content of the direction of the argument. Thus we do not get sentences like: We can now follow the path of the core of the argument. The content of the argument proceeds as follows. The direction of his argument has no substance. I am disturbed by the vacuous path of your argument. The two metaphors would be consistent if there were a way to completely satisfy both purposes with one clearly delineated concept. Instead, what we get is coherence, where there is a partial satisfaction of both purposes. For instance, the JOURNEY metaphor highlights both direction and progress toward a goal. The CONTAINER metaphor highlights the content with respect to its amount, density, centrality, and boundaries. The progress aspect of the JOURNEY metaphor and the amount aspect of the CONTAINER metaphor can be highlighted simultaneously be-cause the amount increases as the argument progresses. And, as we saw, this results in permissible mixed metaphors. ((96)) So far we have looked at the coherences between two metaphorical structurings of the concept ARGUMENT, and we have found the following: —Metaphorical entailments play an essential role in linking all of the instances of a single metaphorical structuring of a concept (as in the various instances of the AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY metaphor). Metaphorical entailments also play an essential role in linking two different metaphorical structurings of a single concept (as in the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors for ARGUMENT). A shared metaphorical entailment can establish a cross-metaphorical correspondence. For example, the shared entail-ment AS WE MAKE AN ARGUMENT, MORE OF A SURFACE IS CREATED establishes a correspondence between the amount of ground covered in the argument (which is in the JOURNEY metaphor) and the amount of content in the argument (which is in the CONTAINER metaphor). The various metaphorical structurings of a concept serve different purposes by highlighting different\naspects of the concept. Where there is an overlapping of purposes, there is an over-lapping of metaphors and hence a coherence between them. Permissible mixed metaphors fall into this overlap. —In general, complete consistency across metaphors is rare; coherence, on the other hand, is typical. ((97)) 17.Complex Coherences across Metaphors The most important thing to bear in mind throughout our discussion of coherence is the role of purpose. A metaphorical structuring of a concept, say the JOURNEY metaphor for arguments, allows us to get a handle on one aspect of the concept. Thus a metaphor works when it satisfies a purpose, namely, understanding an aspect of the concept. When two metaphors successfully satisfy two purposes, then overlaps in the purposes will correspond to overlaps in the metaphors. Such overlaps, we claim, can be characterized in terms of shared metaphorical entailments and the cross-metaphorical correspondences established by them. We saw this in a simple example in the last chapter. We would now like to show that the same mechanisms are involved in complex examples. There are two sources of such complexity: (I) there are often many metaphors that partially structure a single concept and (2) when we discuss one concept, we use other concepts that are themselves understood in metaphorical terms, which leads to further overlapping of metaphors. We can isolate the factors that lead to such complexities by examining further the concept ARGUMENT.\nIn general, arguments serve the purpose of understand-ing. We construct arguments when we need to show the connections between things that are obvious—that we take for granted—and other things that are not obvious. We do this by putting ideas together. These ideas constitute the content of the argument. The things we take for granted are the starting point of the argument. The things we wish to ((98)) show are the goals that we must reach. As we proceed toward these goals, we make progress by establishing connections. The connections may be strong or weak, and the network of connections has an overall structure. In any argument certain ideas and connections may be more basic than others, certain ideas will be more obvious than others. How good an argument is will depend on its content, the strength of the connections, how directly it establishes the connections, and how easy it is to understand the connections. Briefly, the various ARGUMENT metaphors serve the purpose of providing an understanding of the following aspects of the concept: content basicness progress obviousness structure directness strength clarity In the preceding chapter we saw that the JOURNEY metaphor focuses at least on content and progress, that the CONTAINER metaphor focuses at least on content, and that there is an overlap based on the progressive accumulation of content. But these two metaphors serve even more pur-poses and are involved in even more complex coherences. We can see this by considering a third metaphor for arguments: AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING We've got the framework for a solid argument. If you don't support your argument with solid facts, the whole thing will collapse. He is trying to buttress his argument with a lot of irrelevant facts, but it is still so shaky that it will easily jail apart under criticism. With the groundwork you've got, you can construct a pretty strong argument. Together, the JOURNEY, CONTAINER, and BUILDING metaphors focus on all of the above aspects of the concept ARGUMENT, as the following lists show: ((99))\nJOURNEY CONTAINER BUILDING content content content progress progress progress directness basicness basicness obviousness strength strength clarity structure Here are some examples of how we understand each of these aspects in terms of the metaphors: JOURNEY So far, we haven't covered much ground. (progress, content) This is a roundabout argument. (directness) We need to go into this further in order to see clearly what's involved. (progress, obviousness) CONTAINER You have all the right ideas in your argument, but the argu- ment is still not transparent. (contort, progress, clarity) These ideas form the solid core of the argument. (strength, basicness) BUILDING We've got a foundation for the argument, now we need a solid framework. (basicness, strength, structure) We have noir constructed most of the argument. (progress, content) We saw in the preceding chapter that the fact that both journeys and containers define surfaces was the basis for the overlap between the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors. The fact that a building also has a surface, namely, the foundation and the outer shell, makes possible further overlaps with the BUILDING metaphor. In each case the surface defines the content, but in different ways: JOURNEY: The surface defined by the path of the argument \"covers ground,\" and the content is the ground covered by the argument. CONTAINER: The content is inside the container, whose bound-aries are defined by its surface. ((100)) BUILDING: The surface is the outer shell and foundation, which define an interior for the building. But in the BUILDING metaphor, unlike the CONTAINER metaphor, the content is not in the interior; instead, the foundation and outer shell constitute the con-tent. We can see this in examples like: \"The foundation of your argument does not have enough content to support your claims\" and \"The framework of your argument does not have enough substance to withstand criticism.\" Let us call these surfaces \"content-defining surfaces.\" The notion of a content-defining surface is not sufficient to account for many of the coherences that we find among the metaphors. For example, there are instances of metaphorical overlap based on the notion of depth. Since depth is also defined relative to a surface, we might think that the depth- defining surface for each metaphor would be the same as the content-defining surface. However, this is not always the case, as the following examples show: This is a shallow argument; it needs more foundation. (BUILDING)\nWe have gone over these ideas in great depth. (JouRNEY) You haven't gotten to the deepest points yet—those at the core of the argument. (CONTAINER) In both the BUILDING and JOURNEY metaphors, the depth-defining surface is the ground level. In the CONTAINER metaphor, it is again the container surface. JOURNEY CONTAINER BUILDING Content-defining surface Surface created Surface of Foundation by path (the the container and shell cover) Depth-defining surface Ground level Surface of Ground level the container Before proceeding to the coherences, it is important to recognize that there are two different notions of depth operating here. In the BUILDING and CONTAINER metaphors, what is deeper is more basic. The most basic ((101)) parts of the argument are the deepest: the foundation and the core. However, in the JOURNEY metaphor, deep facts are those that are not obvious. Facts that are not on the surface are hidden from immediate view; we need to go into them in depth. The purposes of an argument include covering certain topics (finishing with them—\"putting the lid on\") and, in addition, covering them at appropriate depths. Progress in an argument is not merely a matter of covering topics; it also requires us to go sufficiently deeply into them. Going into the topic to the required depth is part of the journey: As we go into the topic more deeply, we find .. . We have come to a point where we must explore the issues at a deeper level. Since most of the journey is over the surface of the earth, it is that surface that defines the depth of the topics to be covered. But as we go into any one topic in depth, we leave a trail (a surface) behind us, as we do on all parts of the journey. It is by leaving this surface behind that we cover a topic at (1 certain depth. This accounts for the following expressions: We will be going deeply into a variety of topics. As we go along, we will go through these issues in depth. We have now covered all the topics at the appropriate levels. Thus the metaphorical orientation of depth corresponds to basicness in the BUILDING and CONTAINER metaphors but to lack of obviousness in the JOURNEY metaphor. Since depth and progress are very different aspects of an argument, there is no consistent image possible within any of the ARGUMENT metaphors. But here, as before, though consistency is not possible, there is metaphorical coherence. Having clarified the distinction between content-defining surfaces and depth-defining surfaces, we are in a position to see a number of other complex coherences. As in the case of the coherence between the JOURNEY and CONTAINER metaphors, there is coherence among all three metaphors\n((102)) based on the fact that all three have content-defining sur-faces. As the argument proceeds, more of a surface is created, and hence the argument gets more content. This overlap among the three metaphorical structurings of the concept allows mixed metaphors of the following sort: So far we have constructed the core of our argument. Here \"so far\" is from the JOURNEY metaphor, \"construct\" is from the BUILDING metaphor, and \"core\" is from the CONTAINER metaphor. Notice that we can say pretty much the same thing by using the building concept \"foundation\" or the neutral concept \"most basic part\" in place of \"core\": So far we have constructed the foundation of the argument. So far we have constructed the most basic part of the argument. What makes this possible is that depth characterizes basicness in both the BUILDING and CONTAINER metaphors. Both of them have a deepest, that is, most basic part: In the CONTAINER metaphor it is the core, and in the BUILDING metaphor it is the foundation. Thus we have a correspondence between the two metaphors. This can be seen in the following examples, where the CONTAINER and BUILD-ING metaphors can be freely mixed by virtue of the correspondence. These points are central to our argument and provide the foundation for all that is to come. We can undermine the argument by showing that the central points in it are weak. The most important ideas, upon which everything else rests, are at the core of the argument. The correspondence here is based on the shared entailment: AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING. A building has a deepest part. Therefore, AN ARGUMENT HAS A DEEPEST PART. ((103)) AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER. Acontainer has a deepest part. Therefore, AN ARGUMENT HAS A DEEPEST PART. Since depth characterizes basicness for both metaphors, the deepest part is the most basic part. The concept MOST BASIC PART therefore falls into the overlap of the two metaphors and is neutral between them. Since the purpose of an argument is to provide under-standing, it is not surprising that the metaphor UNDER-STANDING IS SEEING should overlap with the various ARGUMENT metaphors. When you travel, you see more as you go along. This carries over to the metaphor AN ARGUMENT Is A JOURNEY. As you go along through the argument, you see more—and, since UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING, yOU understand more. This accounts for expressions like:\nWe have just observed that Aquinas used certain Platonic notions. Halving come this far, we can now see how Hegel went wrong. Because a journey may have a guide who points out things of interest along the way, we also get expressions like: We will now show that Green misinterpreted Kant's account 1 .11 of will. Notice that X does not follow from Y without added assump- tions. We ought to point out that no such proof has yet been found. In these cases, the author is the guide who takes us through the argument. Part of the .JOURNEY metaphor involves going deeply into a subject. The UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING metaphor applies in this case too. In an argument the superficial points (those on the surface) are obvious; they are easy to see, easy to understand. But the deeper points are not obvious. It re-quires effort— digging—to reveal them so that we can see them. As we go more deeply into an issue, we reveal more, ((104)) which allows us to see more, that is, to understand more. This accounts for expressions like: Dig .further into his argument and you will discover a great deal. We can see this only if we delve deeply into the issues. Shallow arguments are practically worthless, since they don't show us very much. The UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING metaphor also overlaps with the BUILDING metaphor, where what is seen is the structure (shape, form, outline, etc.) of the argument: We can now see the outline of the argument. If we look carefully at the structure of the argument ... Finally, the UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING metaphor overlaps with the CONTAINER metaphor, where what we see is the content (through the surface of the container), as in: That is a remarkably transparent argument. I didn't see that point in your argument. Since your argument isn't very clear, I can't see what you're getting at. Your argument has no content at all—I can see right through it. Another cross-metaphorical coherence appears in dis-cussing the quality of an argument. Many of the aspects of an argument that are focused on by the various ARGUMENT metaphors can be quantified—for example, content, clarity, strength, directness, and obviousness. The MORE IS BETTER metaphor overlaps with all of the ARGUMENT metaphors and allows us to view quality in terms of quantity. Thus we have examples like the following: That's not much of an argument.\nYour argument doesn't have any content. It's not a very good argument, since it covers hardly any ground at all. This argument won't do—it's just not clear enough. Your argument is too weak to support your claims. ((105)) The argument is too roundabout—no one will be able to follow it. Your argument doesn't cover the subject matter in enough depth. All of these assess quality in terms of quantity. We have by no means exhausted all the cross-metaphorical coherences involving ARGUMENT metaphors. Consider, for example, the extensive network of coherences based on the ARGUMENT Is WAR metaphor. Here it is possible to win or lose, to attack and defend, to plan and pursue a strategy, etc. Here arguments may be fortresses via the BUILDING metaphor, so that we can launch an attack on an argument, knock holes in it, tear it down and destroy it. Arguments may also be missiles, via the CONTAINER metaphor. Thus we can offer the challenge \"Shoot!\" and the argument in reply may be right on target and hit the mark. In defense you can try to shoot down your opponent's argument. By now it should be clear that the same kinds of coherence found in simple examples also occur in far more complex cases of the sort we have just examined. What may at first appear to be random, isolated metaphorical expressions—for example, cover those points, buttress your argument, get to the core, dig deeper, attack a position, and shoot down—turn out to be not random at all. Rather, they are part of whole metaphorical systems that together serve the complex purpose of characterizing the concept of an argument in all of its aspects, as we conceive them. Though such metaphors do not provide us with a single consistent concrete image, they are nonetheless coherent and do fit together when there are overlapping entailments, though not otherwise. The metaphors come out of our clearly delineated and concrete experiences and allow us to construct highly abstract and elaborate concepts, like that of an argument. ((106)) 18. Some Consequences for Theories of Conceptual Structure Any adequate theory of the human conceptual system will have to give an account of how concepts are (1) grounded, (2) structured, (3) related to each other, and (4) defined. So far we have given a provisional account of grounding, structuring, and relations among concepts (subcategorization, metaphorical entailment, part, participant, etc.) for what we take to be typical cases. We have argued, moreover, that most of our conceptual system is\nmetaphorically structured and have given a brief account of what that means. Before we explore the implications of our views for definition, we need to look at two major strategies that linguists and logicians have used to handle, without any reference to metaphor, what we have called metaphorical concepts. The two strategies are abstraction and homonymy. To see how these differ from the account we have offered, consider the word buttress in \"He buttressed the wall\" and \"He buttressed his argument with more facts.\" On our ac-count, we understand buttress in \"He buttressed his argument\" in terms of the concept BUTTRESS, which is part of the BUILDING gestalt. Since the concept ARGUMENT iS comprehended partly in terms of the metaphor AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING, the meaning of \"buttress\" in the concept ARGUMENT will follow from the meaning it has in the concept BUILDING, plus the way that the BUILDING metaphor in general structures the concept ARGUMENT. Thus we do not need an independent definition for the concept BUTTRESS in \"He buttressed his argument.\" ((107)) Against this, the abstraction view claims that there is a single, very general, and abstract concept BUTTRESS, which is neutral between the BUILDING \"buttress\" and the ARGUMENT \"buttress.\" According to this view, \"He buttressed the wall\" and \"He buttressed his argument\" are both special cases of the same very abstract concept. The homonymy view takes the opposite tack. Instead of claim-ing that there is one abstract and neutral concept BUTTRESS, the homonymy view claims that there are two different and independent concepts, BUTTRESS' and BUTTRESS2. There is a strong homonymy view, according to which BUTTRESS and BUTTRESS2 are entirely different and have nothing to do with each other, since one refers to physical objects (build-ing parts) and the other to an abstract concept (a part of an argument). The weak homonymy view maintains that there are distinct and independent concepts BUTTRESS' and BUTTRESS2 but allows that their meanings may be similar in some respects and that the concepts are related by virtue of this similarity. It denies, however, that either concept is understood in terms of the other. All it claims is that the two concepts have something in common: an abstract similarity. On this point, the weak homonymy view shares an element with the abstraction view, since the abstract similarity would have precisely the properties of the core concept that is hypothesized by the abstraction theory. We would now like to show why neither the abstraction nor the homonymy theory can account for the kinds of facts that have led us to the theory of metaphorical concepts—in particular, the facts concerning the metaphorical types (orientational, physical, and structural) and their properties (internal systematicity, external systematicity, grounding, and coherence). Inadequacies of the Abstraction View The abstraction theory is inadequate in several respects. First, it does not seem to make any sense at all with respect\n((108)) to UP-DOWN orientation metaphors, such as HAPPY IS UP, CONTROL IS UP, MORE IS UP, VIRTUE IS UP, THE FUTURE IS UP, REASON IS UP, etc. What single general concept with any content at all could be an abstraction of HEIGHT, HAPPINESS, CONTROL, MORE, VIRTUE, THE FUTURE, REASON, and NORTH and would precisely fit them all? Moreover, it would seem that uP and DOWN could not be at the same level of abstraction, since uP applies to the FUTURE, while DOWN does not apply to the PAST. We account for this by partial metaphorical structuring, but under the abstraction proposal uP would have to be more abstract in some sense than DOWN, and that does not seem to make sense. Second, the abstraction theory would not distinguish between metaphors of the form A is B and those of the form B is A, since it would claim that there are neutral terms covering both domains. For example, English has the LOVE IS A JOURNEY metaphor but no JOURNEYS ARE LOVE metaphor. The abstraction view would deny that love is understood in terms of journeys, and it would be left with the counterintuitive claim that love and journeys are under-stood in terms of some abstract concept neutral between them. Third, different metaphors can structure different aspects of a single concept; for example, LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS WAR, LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE, LOVE IS MAD-NESS. Each of these provides one perspective on the concept LOVE and structures one of many aspects of the concept. The abstraction hypothesis would seek a single general concept LOVE abstract enough to fit all of these aspects. Even if this were possible, it would miss the point that these metaphors are not jointly characterizing a core concept LOVE but are separately characterizing different aspects of LOVE. Fourth, if we look at structural metaphors of the form A is B (e.g., LOVE IS A JOURNEY, THE MIND IS A MACHINE, IDEAS ARE FOOD, AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING), we find that B (the defining concept) is more clearly delineated in ((109)) our experience and typically more concrete than A (the defined concept). Moreover, there is always more in the defining concept than is carried over to the defined concept. Take IDEAS ARE FOOD. We may have raw facts and half-baked ideas, but there are no sauteed, broiled, or poached ideas. In AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING only the foundation and outer shell play a part in the metaphor, not the inner rooms, corridors, roof, etc. We have explained this asym- metry in the following way: the less clearly delineated (and usually less concrete) concepts are partially understood in terms of the more clearly delineated (and usually more concrete) concepts, which are directly grounded in our experience. The abstraction view has no explanation for this asymmetry, since it cannot explain the tendency to under-stand the less\nconcrete in terms of the more concrete. Fifth, under the abstraction proposal there are no metaphorical concepts at all and, therefore, no reason to expect the kind of systematicity that we have found. Thus, for example, there is no reason to expect a whole system of food concepts to apply to ideas or a whole system of build-ing concepts to apply to arguments. There is no reason to expect the kind of internal consistency that we found in the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT cases. In general, the abstraction view cannot explain the facts of internal systematicity. Abstraction also fails to explain external systematicity. Our proposal accounts for the way that various metaphors for a single concept (e.g., the JOURNEY, BUILDING, CONTAINER, and WAR metaphors for arguments) overlap in the way that they do. This is based on the shared purposes and shared entailments of the metaphorical concepts. The way that individual concepts (such as CORE, FOUNDATION, COVER, SHOOT DOWN, etc.) mix with each other is predicted on the basis of shared purposes and entailments in the en-tire metaphorical system. Since the abstraction proposal does not have any metaphorical systems, it cannot explain why metaphors can mix the way they do. Sixth, since the abstraction proposal has no partial II. ((110)) metaphorical structuring, it cannot account for metaphorical extensions into the unused part of the metaphor, as in \"Your theory is constructed out of cheap stucco\" and many others that fall within the unused portion of the THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS metaphor. Finally, the abstraction hypothesis assumes, in the case of LOVE IS A JOURNEY, for example, that there is a set of abstract concepts, neutral with respect to love and journeys, that can \"fit\" or \"apply to\" both of them. But in order for such abstract concepts to \"fit\" or \"apply to\" love, the concept LOVE must be independently structured so that there can be such a \"fit.\" As we will show, LOVE is not a concept that has a clearly delineated structure; what-ever structure it has it gets only via metaphors. But the abstraction view, which has no metaphors to do the structuring, must assume that a structure as clearly delineated as the relevant aspects of journeys exists independently for the concept LovE. It's hard to imagine how. Inadequacies of the Homonymy View Strong Homonymy Homonymy is the use of the same word for different concepts, as in the bank of a river and the hank you put your money in. Under the strong homonymy theory of the kinds of examples we have been considering, the word \"attack\" in \"They attacked the fort\" and \"They attacked my argument\" would stand for two entirely different and unrelated concepts. The fact that the same word, \"attack,\" is used would be considered an accident. Similarly, the word \"in\" of \"in the kitchen,\" \"in the Elks,\" and \"in love\" would stand for three entirely\ndifferent, independent, and un-related concepts—and again it would be accidental that the same word was used. According to this view, English has dozens of separate and unrelated concepts, all accidentally expressed by the word \"in.\" In general, the strong ((111)) homonymy view cannot account for the relationships that we have identified in systems of metaphorical concepts; that is, it views as accidental all the phenomena that we explain in systematic terms. In the first place, the strong homonymy position cannot account for any of the internal systematicity that we have described. For example, it would be possible, according to this view, for \"I'm feeling up\" to mean \"I'm happy\" and, simultaneously, for \"my spirits rose\" to mean \"I got sad-der.\" Nor can this position account for why the whole system of words used for war should apply in a systematic way to arguments or why a system of food terminology should apply in a systematic way to ideas. Second, the strong homonymy view has the same problems with cases of external systematicity. That is, it cannot account for the overlap of metaphors and the possibility of mixing. It cannot explain, for example, why the \"ground covered\" in an argument can refer to the same thing as the \"content\" of the argument. This holds in general for all the examples of mixing that we have given. Third, the strong homonymy view cannot explain extensions of the used (or unused) portion of a metaphor, as in His theories are Gothic and covered with gargoyles.\" Since that theory has no general metaphors like AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING, it must view such cases as random. Weak Homonymy The obvious general inadequacy of the strong homonymy view is that it cannot account for any of the systematic relationships that we have found in metaphorical concepts because it sees each concept as not only independent but unrelated to other concepts expressed by the same word. The beak homonymy view is superior to the strong view precisely because it does allow for the possibility of such relationships. In particular, it holds that the various concepts expressed by a single word can in many cases be ((112)) related by similarity. The weak homonymy view takes such similarities as given and assumes that they are sufficient to account for all the phenomena that we have observed, though without the use of any metaphorical structuring. The most obvious difference between the weak homonymy position and ours is that it has no notion of understanding one thing in terms of another and hence no general metaphorical structuring. The reason for this is that most of those who hold this position are not concerned with how our conceptual system is grounded in experience and how\nunderstanding emerges from such grounding. Most of the inadequacies we find in the weak homonymy position have to do with its lack of concern for issues of under-standing and grounding. These same inadequacies will, of course, apply also to the strong version of the homonymy position. First, we have suggested that there is directionality in metaphor, that is, that we understand one concept in terms of another. Specifically, we tend to structure the less con- crete and inherently vaguer concepts (like those for the emotions) in terms of more concrete concepts, which are more clearly delineated in our experience. The weak homonymy position would deny that we understand the abstract in terms of the concrete or that we understand concepts of one kind in terms of concepts of another kind at all. It claims only that we can perceive similarities between various concepts and that such similarities will account for the use of the same words for the concepts. It would deny, for example, that the concept BUTTRESS, when part of the concept ARGUMENT, iS under-stood in terms of the physical concept BUTTRESS as used in BUILDING. It would simply claim that these are two distinct concepts, neither of which is used to understand the other but which happen to have an abstract similarity. Similarly, it would say that all of the concepts for in or up are not ways of understanding concepts partly in terms of spatial orientation but, rather, are independent concepts related by ((113)) similarity. On this view, it would be an accident that most of the pairs of concepts that exhibit \"similarities\" happen to consist of one relatively concrete concept and one relatively abstract concept (as is the case with BUTTRESS). In our account the concrete concept is being used to under-stand the more abstract concept; in theirs, there would be no reason for there to be more similarities between an abstract and a concrete concept than between two abstract concepts or two concrete concepts. Second, the claim that such similarities exist is highly questionable. For example, what possible similarities could there be that are shared by all of the concepts that are oriented uP? What similarity could there be between uP, on the one hand, and HAPPINESS, HEALTH, CONTROL, CONSCIOUSNESS, VIRTUE, RATIONALITY, MORE, etc., on the other? What similarities (which are not themselves metaphorical) could there be between a MIND and a BRITTLE OBJECT, or between IDEAS and FOOD? What is there that is not metaphorical about an instant of time in itself that gives it the front-back orientation that we saw in our discus- sion of the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT metaphor? On the weak homonymy view, this front- back orientation must be assumed as an inherent property of instants of time if expressions like \"follow,\" \"precede,\" \"meet the future head on,\" \"face the future,\" etc., are to be explained on the basis of inherent conceptual similarity. So far as we can see, there is no reasonable theory of inherent similarity that can account for any of these cases. Third, we have given an account of metaphorical grounding in terms of systematic correspondences in our experience, for example, being dominant in a fight and being physically up. But there is a difference between correspondences in our experience and similarities, since the correspondence need not be based on any similarity. On the basis of such correspondences in our experience, we can give an account of the range of possible metaphors. The weak homonymy position has no predictive power at all and ((114))\nseeks none. It simply tries to provide an after-the-fact ac-count of what similarities there are. Thus, in the cases where similarities can be found, the weak homonymy position still gives no account of why just those similarities should be there. To our knowledge, no one explicitly holds the strong homonymy position, according to which concepts ex-pressed by the same word (like the two senses of \"but-tress\" or the many senses of \"in\"), are independent and have no significant relationships. Those who hold the homonymy position tend to identify themselves as holding the weak position, where the interdependencies and inter-relationships that are observed between concepts are to be accounted for by similarities based on the inherent nature of the concept. However, to our knowledge, no one has ever begun to provide a detailed account of a theory of similarity that could deal with the wide range of examples we have discussed. Although virtually all homonymy theorists espouse the weak version, in practice there seem to be only strong homonymy theories, since no one has attempted to provide the detailed account of similarity necessary to maintain the weak version of the theory. And there is a good reason why no attempt has been made to give such a detailed account of the kinds of examples we have been discussing. The reason is that such an account would re-quire one to address the issue of how we comprehend and understand areas of experience that are not well-defined in their own terms and must be grasped in terms of other areas of experience. In general, philosophers and linguists have not been concerned with such questions. ((115)) 19 Definition and Understanding We have seen that metaphor pervades our normal conceptual system. Because so many of the concepts that are important to us are either abstract or not clearly delineated in our experience (the emotions, ideas, time, etc.), we need to get a grasp on them by means of other concepts that we understand in clearer terms (spatial orientations, objects, etc.). This need leads to metaphorical definition in our conceptual system. We have tried with examples\nto give some indication of just how extensive a role metaphor plays in the way we function, the way we conceptualize our experience, and the way we speak. Most of our evidence has come from language—from the meanings of words and phrases and from the way humans make sense of their experiences. Yet students of meaning and dictionary makers have not found it important to try to give a general account of how people understand normal concepts in terms of systematic metaphors like LOVE IS A JOURNEY, ARGUMENT IS WAR, TIME IS MONEY, etc. For example, if you look in a dictionary under \"love,\" you find entries that mention affection, fondness, devotion, infatuation, and even sexual desire, but there is no mention of the way in which we comprehend love by means of metaphors like LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS MADNESS, LOVE IS WAR, etc. If we take expressions like \"Look how far we've come\" or \"Where are we now?\" there would be no way to tell from a standard dictionary or any other standard ac-count of meaning that these expressions are normal ways of talking about the experience of love in our culture. Hints of ((116)) the existence of such general metaphors may be given in the secondary or tertiary senses of other words. For instance, a hint of the LOVE IS MADNESS metaphor may show up in a tertiary sense of the word \"crazy\" (= \"immoderately fond, infatuated\"), but this hint shows up as part of the definition of \"crazy\" rather than as part of the definition of \"love.\" What this suggests to us is that dictionary makers and other students of meaning have different concerns than we do. We are concerned primarily with how people under-stand their experiences. We view language as providing data that can lead to general principles of understanding. The general principles involve whole systems of concepts rather than individual words or individual concepts. We have found that such principles are often metaphoric in nature and involve understanding one kind of experience in terms of another kind of experience. Bearing this in mind, we can see the main difference between our enterprise and that of dictionary makers and other students of meaning. It would be very strange in a dictionary to see \"madness\" or \"journeying\" as senses of \"love.\" They are not senses of \"love,\" any more than \"food\" is one of the senses of \"idea.\" Definitions for a concept are seen as characterizing the things that are inherent in the concept itself. We, on the other hand, are concerned with how human beings get a handle on the concept—how they understand it and function in terms of it. Madness and journeys give us handles on the concept of love, and food gives us a handle on the concept of an idea. Such a concern for how we comprehend experience re-quires a very different concept of definition from the standard one. The principal issue for such an account of definition is what gets defined and what does the defining. That is the issue we turn to next.\n((117)) The Objects of Metaphorical Definition: Natural Kinds of Experience We have found that metaphors allow us to understand one domain of experience in terms of another. This suggests that understanding takes place in terms of entire domains of experience and not in terms of isolated concepts. The fact that we have been led to hypothesize metaphors like LOVE IS A JOURNEY, TIME IS MONEY, and ARGUMENT IS WAR suggests to us that the focus of definition is at the level of basic domains of experience like love, time, and argument. These experiences are then conceptualized and defined in terms of other basic domains of experience like journeys, money, and war. The definition of subconcepts, like BUDGETING TIME and ATTACKING A CLAIM, should fall out as consequences of defining the more general concepts (TIME, ARGUMENT, etc.) in metaphorical terms. This raises a fundamental question: What constitutes a \"basic domain of experience\"? Each such domain is a structured whole within our experience that is conceptualized as what we have called an experiential gestalt. Such gestalts are experientially basic because they characterize structured wholes within recurrent human experiences. They represent coherent organizations of our experiences in terms of natural dimensions (parts, stages, causes, etc.). Domains of experience that are organized as gestalts in terms of such natural dimensions seem to us to be natural kinds of experience. They are natural in the following sense: These kinds of experiences are a product of Our bodies (perceptual and motor apparatus, mental capacities, emotional makeup, etc.) Our interactions with our physical environment (moving, manipulating objects, eating, etc.) Our interactions with other people within our culture (in terms of social, political, economic, and religious institutions) ((118)) In other words, these \"natural\" kinds of experience are products of human nature. Some may be universal, while others will vary from culture to culture. We are proposing that the concepts that occur in metaphorical definitions are those that correspond to natural kinds of experience. Judging by the concepts that are defined by the metaphors we have uncovered so far, the following would be examples of concepts for natural kinds of experience in our culture: LOVE, TIME, IDEAS, UNDER- STANDING, ARGUMENTS, LABOR, HAPPINESS, HEALTH, CONTROL, STATUS, MORALITY, etc. These are concepts that require metaphorical definition, since they are not clearly enough delineated in their own terms to satisfy the purposes of our day-to-day functioning. Similarly, we would suggest that concepts that are used in metaphorical definitions to define other concepts also correspond to natural kinds of experience. Examples are\nPHYSICAL ORIENTATIONS, OBJECTS, SUBSTANCES, SEEING, JOURNEYS, WAR, MADNESS, FOOD, BUILDINGS, etc. These concepts for natural kinds of experience and objects are structured clearly enough and with enough of the right kind of internal structure to do the job of defining other concepts. That is, they provide the right kind of structure to allow us to get a handle on those natural kinds of experience that are less concrete or less clearly delineated in their own terms. It follows from this that some natural kinds of experience are partly metaphorical in nature, since metaphor plays an essential role in characterizing the structure of the experi- ence. Argument is an obvious example, since experiencing certain activities of talking and listening as an argument partly requires the structure given to the concept ARGUMENT by the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor. The experience of time is a natural kind of experience that is understood almost entirely in metaphorical terms (via the spatialization ((119)) of TIME and the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT and TIME IS MONEY metaphors). Similarly, all of the concepts (e.g., CONTROL, STATUS, HAPPINESS) that are oriented by UP-DOWN and other spatialization concepts are grounded in natural kinds of experience that are partly understood in metaphorical terms. Interactional Properties We have seen that our conceptual system is grounded in our experiences in the world. Both directly emergent concepts (like UP-DOWN, OBJECT, and DIRECT MANIPULATION) and metaphors (like HAPPY IS UP, EVENTS ARE OBJECTS, ARGUMENT IS WAR) are grounded in our constant interaction with our physical and cultural environments. Likewise, the dimensions in terms of which we structure our experience (e.g., parts, stages, purposes) emerge naturally from our activity in the world. The kind of conceptual system we have is a product of the kind of beings we are and the way we interact with our physical and cultural environments. Our concern with the way we understand our experience has led us to a view of definition that is very different from the standard view. The standard view seeks to be \"objective,\" and it assumes that experiences and objects have inherent properties and that human beings understand them solely in terms of these properties. Definition for the objectivist is a matter of saying what those inherent properties are by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept. \"Love,\" on the objectivist view, has various senses, each of which can be defined in terms of such inherent properties as fondness, affection, sexual desire, etc. Against this view, we would claim that we comprehend love only partly in terms of such inherent properties. For the most part, our comprehension of love is metaphorical, and we understand it primarily in terms of concepts for other natural kinds of experience: JOURNEYS, MADNESS, WAR, HEALTH, etc. Because defining concepts (JOURNEYS, MADNESS, WAR, HEALTH) emerge from our interactions with one another and with the world, the con- ((120))\ncept they metaphorically define (e.g., LOVE) will be under-stood in terms of what we will call interactional properties. In order to get a clearer idea of what interactional properties are in general, let us look at the interactional properties of an object. Take the concept GUN. You might think that such a concept could be characterized entirely in terms of inherent properties of the object itself, for example, its shape, its weight, how its parts are put together, etc. But our concept GUN goes beyond this in ways that can be seen when we apply various modifiers to the concept. For example, take the difference between the modifiers BLACK and FAKE as applied to GUN. The principal difference for objectivist accounts of definition is that a BLACK GUN is a GUN, while a FAKE GUN iS not a GUN. BLACK iS seen as adding an additional property to GUN, while FAKE is seen as applying to the concept GUN to yield another concept that is not a subcategory of GUN. This is about all that is said on the objectivist view. It will allow the entailments: This is a black gun. __________ This is a fake gun. Therefore, this is a gun. and Therefore, this is not a gun. What such an account does not do is to say what a fake gun is. It does not account for entailments like: This is a fake gun. Therefore, this is not a giraffe. This is a fake gun. Therefore, this is not a bowl of bean-sauce noodles. And on and on .. . To account for such an indefinitely long list of entailments, we need a detailed account of just how FAKE modifies the concept GUN. A fake gun has to look enough like a gun for the purpose at hand. That is, it has to have the contextually appropriate perceptual properties of a gun. You have to be able to perform enough of the appropriate physical manipulations that you would with a real gun (e.g., ((121)) hold it a certain way). In other words, a fake gun has to maintain what we might call motor- activity properties of a gun. Moreover, the point of having a fake gun is that it will serve certain of the purposes that a real gun could serve (threatening, being on display, etc.). What makes a fake gun fake is that it cannot function like a gun. If it can shoot you, it is a real gun, not a fake gun. Finally, it cannot originally have been made to function like a gun: a broken or inoperable gun is not a fake gun. Thus, the modifier FAKE preserves certain kinds of the properties of GUNS and negates others. To summarize: FAKE preserves: Perceptual properties (a fake gun looks like a gun) Motor-activity properties (you handle it like a gun) Purposive properties (it serves some of the purposes of a gun)\nFAKE negates: Functional properties (a fake gun doesn't shoot) History of function (if it was made to be a real gun, then it's not a fake) This account of how FAKE affects the concept of GUN indicates that the concept GUN has at least five dimensions, three of which are preserved by FAKE and two of which are negated. This suggests that we conceptualize a gun in terms of a multidimensional gestalt of properties where the di- mensions are PERCEPTUAL, MOTOR ACTIVITY, PURPOSIVE, FUNCTIONAL, etc. If we look at what perceptual, motor-activity, and purposive properties are, we see that they are not inherent in guns themselves. Instead, they have to do with the way we interact with guns. This indicates that the concept GUN, as people actually understand it, is at least partly defined by interactional properties having to do with perception, motor activity, purpose, function, etc. Thus we find that our concepts of objects, like our concepts of events and activities, ((122)) are characterizable as multidimensional gestalts whose dimensions emerge naturally from our experience in the world. Categorization On the standard objectivist view, we can understand (and hence define) an object entirely in terms of a set of its inherent properties. But, as we have just seen, at least some of the properties that characterize our concept of an object are interactional. In addition, the properties do not merely form a set but rather a structured gestalt, with dimensions that emerge naturally from our experience. The objectivist account of definition is inadequate to ac-count for understanding in another way as well. On the objectivist view, a category is defined in terms of set theory: it is characterized by a set of inherent properties of the entities in the category. Everything in the universe is either inside or outside the category. The things that are in the category are those that have all the requisite inherent properties. Anything that fails to have one or more of the inherent properties falls outside the category. This set-theoretical concept of a category does not ac-cord with the way people categorize things and experiences. For human beings, categorization is primarily a means of comprehending the world, and as such it must serve that purpose in a sufficiently flexible way. Set-theoretical categorization, as a model for human categorization, misses the following: 1. As Rosch (1977) has established, we categorize things in terms of prototypes. A prototypical chair, for us, has a well-defined back, seat, four legs, and (optionally) two armrests. But there are nonprototypical chairs as well: beanbag chairs, hanging chairs, swivel chairs, contour chairs, barber chairs, etc. We understand the nonprototypical chairs as being chairs, not just on their own terms, but by virtue of their relation to a prototypical chair.\n((123)) 2.We understand beanbag chairs, barber chairs, and contour chairs as being chairs, not because they share some fixed set of defining properties with the prototype, but rather because they bear a sufficient family resemblance to the prototype. A beanbag chair may resemble a prototypical chair in a different way than a barber chair does. There need be no fixed core of properties of prototypical chairs that are shared by both beanbag and barber chairs. Yet they are both chairs because each, in its different way, is sufficiently close to the prototype. 3.Interactional properties are prominent among the kinds of properties that count in determining sufficient family resemblance. Chairs share with stools and other kinds of seats the PURPOSIVE property of allowing us to sit. But the range of MOTOR ACTIVITIES permitted by chairs is usually different from stools and other seats. Thus the interactional properties relevant to our comprehension of chairs will include perceptual properties (the way they look, feel, etc.), functional properties (allowing us to sit), motor- activity properties (what we do with our bodies in getting in and out of them and while we're in them), and purposive properties (relaxing, eating, writing letters, etc.). 4.Categories can be systematically extended in various ways for various purposes. There are modifiers, called hedges (see Lakoff 1975), that pick out the prototype for a category and that define various kinds of relationships to it. Here are a few examples: PAR EXCELLENCE: This picks out prototypical members of a category. For example, a robin is a bird par excellence, but chickens, ostriches, and penguins are not birds par excellence. STRICTLY SPEAKING: This picks out the nonprototypical cases that ordinarily fall within the category. Strictly speak-ing, chickens, ostriches, and penguins are birds even though they are not birds par excellence. Sharks, blowfish, catfish, and goldfish are not fish par excellence, but they are fish, strictly speaking. LOOSELY SPEAKING: This picks out things that are not ordinarily in the category because they lack some central property but which share enough properties so that for certain purposes it could make sense to consider them category members. Strictly speaking, a whale is not a fish, though, loosely speaking, it may be considered one in certain con-texts. Strictly speaking, a moped is not a motorcycle, though, loosely speaking, mopeds could be included among motorcycles. TECHNICALLY: This circumscribes a category relative to some technical purpose. Whether something is technically in the category or not will depend on what the purpose in classifying it is. For the purpose of insurance, a moped is technically not a motorcycle, though for purposes of bridge tolls it technically is. Some other hedges include in an important sense, to all in-tents and purposes, a regular ... , a veritable ... , to the ex-tent that ... , in certain respects, and many, many more. These various hedges allow us to place objects, events, and experiences under a wide variety of categories for various purposes, e.g., to draw practical distinctions in sensible ways, to provide new perspectives, and to make sense of apparently disparate phenomena. 5.Categories are open-ended. Metaphorical definitions can give us a handle on things and experiences we have already categorized, or they may lead to a recategorization. For example, viewing LOVE as WAR may make sense of certain experiences that you took as LOVE experiences of some kind or other but that you could not fit together in any meaningful way. The LOVE IS WAR metaphor may also lead you to categorize certain experiences as LOVE experiences that you had previously not viewed\nas such. Hedges also reveal the open-ended nature of our categories; that is, an object may often be seen as being in a category or not, depending on our purposes in classifying it. Though categories are open-ended, categorization is not random, since both metaphors and hedges define (or redefine) categories in systematic ways. ((125)) Summary We have argued that an account of how people understand their experiences requires a view of definition very different from the standard account. An experiential theory of def- inition has a different notion of what needs to be defined and what does the defining. On our account, individual concepts are not defined in an isolated fashion, but rather in terms of their roles in natural kinds of experiences. Concepts are not defined solely in terms of inherent properties; instead, they are defined primarily in terms of interactional properties. Finally, definition is not a matter of giving some fixed set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of a concept (though this may be possible in certain special cases, such as in science or other technical disciplines, though even there it is not always possible); instead, concepts are defined by prototypes and by types of relations to prototypes. Rather than being rigidly defined, concepts arising from our experience are open-ended. Metaphors and hedges are systematic devices for further defining a concept and for changing its range of applicability. ((126)) 20. How Metaphor Can Give Meaning to Form We speak in linear order; in a sentence, we say some words earlier and others later. Since speaking is correlated with time and time is metaphorically conceptualized in terms of space, it is natural for us to conceptualize language metaphorically in terms of space. Our writing system reinforces this conceptualization. Writing a sentence down allows us to\nconceptualize it even more readily as a spatial object with words in a linear order. Thus our spatial concepts naturally apply to linguistic expressions. We know which word occupies the ,first position in the sentence, whether two words are close to each other or jar apart, whether a word is relatively long or short. Because we conceptualize linguistic form in spatial terms, it is possible for certain spatial metaphors to apply directly to the form of a sentence, as we conceive of it spatially. This can provide automatic direct links between form and content, based on general metaphors in our conceptual system. Such links make the relationship between form and content anything but arbitrary, and some of the meaning of a sentence can be due to the precise form the sentence takes. Thus, as Dwight Bolinger (1977) has claimed, exact paraphrases are usually impossible because the so-called paraphrases are expressed in different forms. We can now offer an explanation for this: We spatialize linguistic form. Spatial metaphors apply to linguistic form as it is spatialized. — Linguistic forms are themselves endowed with content by virtue of spatialization metaphors. ((127)) More of Form Is More of Content For example, the CONDUIT metaphor defines a spatial relationship between form and content: LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS, and their meanings are the content of those containers. When we see actual containers that are small, we expect their contents to be small. When we see actual containers that are large, we normally expect their contents to be large. Applying this to the CONDUIT metaphor, we get the expectation: MORE OF FORM IS MORE OF CONTENT. As we shall see, this is a very general principle that seems to occur naturally throughout the world's languages. Though the CONDUIT metaphor is widespread, we do not know yet whether it is universal. We would expect, how-ever, that some metaphorical spatialization of language would occur in every language and, whatever the details, it would not be surprising to find such correlations of amount. An English example of MORE OF FORM IS MORE OF CON-TENT IS iteration: He ran and ran and ran and ran. which indicates more running than just He ran. Similarly, He is very very very tall. indicates that he is taller than He is very tall. does. Extended lengthening of a vowel can have the same effect. Saying He is bi-i-i-i-ig! indicates that he is bigger than you indicate when you say just\n((128)) He is big. Many languages of the world use the morphological device of reduplication, that is, the repetition of one or two syllables of a word, or of the whole word, in this way. To our knowledge, all cases of reduplication in the languages of the world are instances where MORE OF FORM stands for MORE OF CONTENT. The most typical devices are: Reduplication applied to noun turns singular to plural or col- lective. Reduplication applied to verb indicates continuation or corn- pletion. Reduplication applied to adjective indicates intensification or increase. Reduplication applied to a word for something small indicates diminution. The generalization is as follows: A noun stands for an object of a certain kind. More of the noun stands for more objects of that kind. A verb stands for an action. More of the verb stands for more of the action (perhaps until completion). An adjective stands for a property. More of the adjective stands for more of the property. A word stands for something small. More of the word stands for something smaller. Closeness Is Strength of Effect A much subtler example of the way metaphor gives mean-ing to form occurs in English (and possibly in other languages as well, though detailed studies have not been done). English has the conventional metaphor CLOSENESS IS STRENGTH OF EFFECT. Thus, the sentence ((129)) Who are the men closest to Khomeini? means Who are the men who have the strongest c ffect on Kho- mei ni? Here the metaphor has a purely semantic effect. It has to do with the meaning of the word \"close.\" However, the metaphor can also apply to the syntactic form of a sentence. The reason\nis that one of the things the syntax of the sentence indicates is how CLOSE two expressions are to each other. The CLOSENESS iS one of,form. This metaphor can apply to the relation between form and meaning in the following way: If the meaning of form A affects the meaning of form B, then, the CLOSER form A is to form B, the STRONGER will be the EFFECT of the meaning of A on the meaning of B. For example, a sentential negative like not has the effect of negating a predicate, as in John won't leave until tomorrow. The form n't has the effect of negation on the predicate with the form leave. There is a rule in English, sometimes called negative transportation, which has the effect of placing the negative further away from the predicate it logically negates; for example, Mary doesn't think he'll leave until tomorrow. Here n't logically negates leave rather than think. This sentence has roughly the same meaning as Mary thinks he won't leave until tomorrow. except that in the first sentence, where the negative is FURTHER AWAY from leave, it has a WEAKER negative force. In the second sentence, where the negative is CLOSER, the force of negation is STRONGER. ((130)) Karl Zimmer (personal communication) has observed that the same principle governs differences like Harry is not happy versus Harry is unhappy. The negative prefix un- is closer to the adjective happy than is the separate word not. The negative has a stronger effect in Harry is unhappy than in Harry is not happy. Unhappy means sad, while not happy is open to the interpretation of being neutral—neither happy nor sad, but in between. This is typical of the difference between negatives and negative affixes, both in English and in other languages. The same metaphor can be seen at work in the following examples: I (aught Greek to Harry. I taught Harry Greek. In the second sentence, where taught and Harry are closer, there is more of a suggestion that Harry actually learned what was taught him—that is, that the teaching had an effect on him. The following examples are even subtler: I found that the chair was comfortable. I found the chair comfortable. The second sentence indicates that I found out that the chair was comfortable by direct experience—by sitting in it. The first sentence leaves open the possibility that I found it out indirectly—say, by asking people or taking a survey. In the second sentence, the form I is CLOSER to the forms the chair and comfortable. The syntax of the sentence indicates the\ndirectness of the experience with the chair by which I found that the chair was comfortable. The CLOSER the form I is to the forms the chair and comfortable, the more direct is the experience that is indicated. Here the effect of the syntax is to indicate the directness of the experience, and CLOSENESS indicates the STRENGTH OF that EFFECT. This ((131)) phenomenon in English is verified in detail by Borkin (in press). The same metaphor can be seen at work in examples like: Sam killed Harry. Sam caused Harry to die. If the cause is a single event, as in the first sentence, the causation is more direct. The second sentence indicates indirect or remote causation—two separate events, Harry's death and what Sam did to cause it. If one wants to indicate causation that is even more indirect, one can say: Sam brought it about that Harry died. The effect that the syntax has in these sentences is to indicate how direct the causal link is between what Sam did and what happened to Harry. The principle at work is this: The CLOSER the form indicating C/WSATION is to the form indicating the EFFECT, the srRONC;ER the causal link is. In Saran killed Harty, there is only a single form—the word kill—to indicate both the CAUSATION and the EFFECT (death). The forms for this meaning are as close as they can be: one word includes them both. This indicates that the causal link is as strong as it could be: a single event. In Sam caused Harry to die, there are two separate words—cause and die—indicating cause and effect. This indicates that the link between the cause and the effect is not as strong as it could he—the cause and the effect are not part of the same event. In Sam brought it about that Harry died, there are two separate clauses: Sam brought it about and that Harry , which indicates a still weaker causal link. In summary, in all of these cases a difference in form indicates a subtle difference in meaning. Just what the subtle differences are is given by the metaphor CLOSENESS IS STRENGTH OF EFFECT, where CLOSENESS applies to elements of the syntax of the sentence, while STRENGTH OF EFFECT applies to the meaning of the sentence. The CLOSE- ((132))\nNESS has to do with form, while the STRENGTH OF EFFECT has to do with meaning. Thus the metaphor CLOSENESS IS STRENGTH OF EFFECT, which is part of our normal conceptual system, can work either in purely semantic terms, as in the sentence \"Who are the men closest to Khomeini?,\" or it can link form to meaning, since CLOSENESS can indicate a relation holding between two forms in a sentence. The subtle shades of meaning that we see in the examples given above are thus the consequences not of special rules of English but of a metaphor that is in our conceptual system applying naturally to the form of the language. The ME-FIRST Orientation Cooper and Ross (1975) observe that our culture's view of what a prototypical member of our culture is like determines an orientation of concepts within our conceptual system. The canonical person forms a conceptual reference point, and an enormous number of concepts in our conceptual system are oriented with respect to whether or not they are similar to the properties of the prototypical person. Since people typically function in an upright position, see and move frontward, spend most of their time performing actions, and view themselves as being basically good, we have a basis in our experience for viewing ourselves as more uP than DOWN, more FRONT than BACK, more ACTIVE than PASSIVE, more GOOD than BAD. Since we are where we are and exist in the present, we conceive of ourselves as being HERE rather than THERE, and NOW rather than THEN. This determines what Cooper and Ross call the ME-FIRST orientation: up, FRONT, ACTIVE, GOOD, HERE, and NOW are all oriented toward the canonical person; DOWN, BACK-WARD, PASSIVE, BAD, THERE, and THEN are all oriented away from the canonical person. This cultural orientation correlates with the fact that in ((133)) English certain orders of words are more normal than others: More Normal up and down front and back active and passive good and bad here and there now and then Less Normal down and up back and front passive and active bad and good there and here then and now The general principle is: Relative to the properties of the prototypical person, the word whose meaning is NEAREST comes FIRST. This principle states a correlation between form and content. Like the other principles that we have seen so far, it is a consequence of a metaphor in our normal conceptual system: NEAREST IS FIRST. For example, suppose you are pointing out someone in a picture. If you say The first person on Bill's left is Sam. you mean The person who is on Bill's left and nearest to him is Sam. To summarize: Since we speak in linear order, we constantly have to choose which words to put first. Given an otherwise random choice between up and down and down and up, we automatically choose up and down. Of the two concepts uP and DOWN, UP is oriented NEAREST to\nthe prototypical speaker. Since NEAREST IS FIRST is part of our conceptual system, we place the word whose meaning is NEAREST (namely, up) in FIRST position. The word order up and down is thus more coherent with our conceptual system than the order down and up. For a detailed account of this phenomenon and a discussion of apparent counterexamples, see Cooper and Ross (1975). ((134)) Metaphorical Coherence in Grammar An Instrument Is ci Companion It is common for a child playing with a toy to act toward it as if it were a companion, talking to it, putting it on his pillow next to him at night, etc. Dolls are toys designed especially for this purpose. Behavior like this occurs in adults, who treat certain significant instruments like cars and guns as companions, giving them names, talking to them, etc. Likewise, in our conceptual system, there is the conventional metaphor AN INSTRUMENT IS A COMPANION, which is reflected in the following examples: AN INSTRUMENT IS A COMPANION Me and my old Chevy have seen a lot of the country to- gether. Q: Who's gonna stop me? A: Me and old Betsy here [said by the cowboy reaching for his gun]. Domenico is going on tour with his priceless Stradivarius. Sleezo the Magician and his Magic Harmonica will be per-forming tonight at the Rialto. Why With Indicates Both INSTRUMENTALITY and ACCOMPANIMENT The word with indicates ACCOMPANIMENT in English, as in: I went to the movies with Sally. (COMPANION) The fact that it is with and not some other word that indicates ACCOMPANIMENT 1S an arbitrary convention of English. In other languages, other words (or grammatical de-vices like case endings) indicate ACCOMPANIMENT (e.g., avec in French). But given the fact that with indicates ACCOMPANIMENT in English, it is no accident that with also indicates INSTRUMENTALITY, as in: I sliced the salami with a knife. (INSTRUMENT) ((135)) The reason that this is not arbitrary is that our conceptual system is structured by the metaphor AN INSTRUMENT IS A COMPANION. It is a systematic, not an accidental, fact about English that the same word that indicates ACCOMPANIMENT also indicates INSTRUMENTALITY. This grammatical fact about English is coherent with the conceptual system of English. As it happens, this is not merely a fact about English. With few exceptions, the following principle holds in all the languages of the world: The word or grammatical device that indicates AccoMPANIMENT also indicates\nINSTRUMENTALITY. Since the experiences on which the metaphor AN INSTRUMENT IS A COMPANION are based are likely to be universal, it is natural that this grammatical principle holds in most languages. Those languages where the principle holds are coherent with the metaphor; those languages where the principle does not hold are not coherent with this metaphor. Where the INSTRUMENT IS A COMPANION coherence does not appear in a language, it is common for some other conceptual coherence to appear in its place. Thus, there are languages where INSTRUMENT is indicated by a form of the verb use or where ACCOMPANIMENT iS indicated by the word for and. These are other, nonmetaphorical, ways in which form may be coherent with content. The \"Lod>ic\" of a Language The use of the same word to indicate INSTRUMENTALITY as well as ACCOMPANIMENT makes sense. It makes such form-content links coherent with the conceptual system of the language. Similarly, the use of spatial words like in and at for time expressions (e.g., in an hour, at ten o'clock) makes sense given that TIME is metaphorically conceptualized in terms of SPACE. Metaphors in the conceptual system indicate coherent and systematic relationships between concepts. The use of the same words and grammati- ((136)) cal devices for concepts with systematic metaphorical correspondences (like TIME and SPACE) is one of the ways in which the correspondences between form and meaning in a language are \"logical\" rather than arbitrary. Conclusion Subtle Variations in Meaning Is paraphrase possible? Can two different sentences ever mean exactly the same thing? Dwight Bolinger has spent most of his career showing that this is virtually impossible and that almost any change in a sentence—whether a change in word order, vocabulary, intonation, or grammatical construction—will alter the sentence's meaning, though often in a subtle way. We are now in a position to see '%'hy this should be so. We conceptualize sentences metaphorically in spatial terms, with elements of linguistic form bearing spatial properties (like length) and relations (like closeness). Therefore, the spatial metaphors inherent in our conceptual system (like CLOSENESS IS STRENGTH OF EFFECT) will automatically structure relationships between form and content. While some aspects of the meaning of a sentence are consequences of certain relatively arbitrary conventions of the language, other aspects of meaning arise by virtue of our natural attempt to make what we say coherent with our conceptual system. This includes the form that we say things in, since that form is conceptualized in spatial terms. Regularities of Linguistic Form We have seen that metaphors play an important role in characterizing regularities of\nlinguistic form. One such regularity is the use of the same word to indicate both accom- paniment and instrumentality. This regularity is coherent with the conceptual metaphor INSTRUMENTS ARE COMPANIONS. Many of what we perceive as \"natural\" regularities ((137)) of linguistic form are regularities that are coherent with metaphors in our conceptual system. 'Take, for example, the fact that questions typically end in what we perceive as a \"rising\" intonation, while statements typically end in what we perceive as a \"falling\" intonation. This is coherent with the orientational metaphor UN-KNOWN IS UP; KNOWN IS DOWN. This conceptual metaphor can be seen in examples like: That's still up in the air. I'd like to raise some questions about that. That settles the question. It's still up for grabs. Let's bring it up for discussion. And the reason that the verb come is used in come up with an answer is that the answer is conceptualized as starting out DOWN and ending where we are, namely, uP. Questions typically indicate what is unknown. The use of rising intonation in questions is therefore coherent with UNKNOWN IS UP. The use of falling intonations with statements is therefore coherent with KNOWN IS DOWN. In fact, questions with falling intonation are understood not as real questions but as rhetorical questions indicating statements. For example, \"Will you ever learn?\" said with falling intonation is a way of saying, indirectly, \"You'll never learn.\" Similarly, statements with rising intonation indicate uncertainty or inability to make sense of something. For example, \"Your name's Fred\" said with rising intonation indicates that you're not sure and want confirmation. \"The Giants traded Madlock\" said with rising intonation indicates an inability to make sense of something—that it doesn't fit with what you know. These are all examples of the use of rising and falling intonation coherently with the UNKNOWN IS UP, KNOWN IS DOWN metaphor. Incidentally, WH-questions in English have falling intonation, for example, \"Who did John see yesterday?\" Our guess as to the reason for this is that most of the content of ((138)) WH-questions is known, and only a single piece of in-formation is taken to be unknown. For instance, \"Who did John see yesterday?\" presupposes that John saw someone yesterday. As\nmight be expected, tone languages generally do not use intonation to mark questions at all, usually making use of question particles. On the whole, where intonation signals the difference between questions and statements, rising intonation goes with the unknown (yes- no) questions and falling intonation with the known (statements). Examples like this indicate that regularities of linguistic form cannot be explained in formal terms alone. Many such regularities make sense only when they are seen in terms of the application of conceptual metaphors to our spatial conceptualization of linguistic form. In other words, syntax is not independent of meaning, especially metaphorical aspects of meaning. The \"logic\" of a language is based on the coherences between the spatialized form of the language and the conceptual system, especially the metaphorical aspects of the conceptual system. ((139))\n21. New Meaning The metaphors we have discussed so far are conventional metaphors, that is, metaphors that structure the ordinary conceptual system of our culture, which is reflected in our everyday language. We would now like to turn to metaphors that are outside our conventional conceptual system, metaphors that are imaginative and creative. Such metaphors are capable of giving us a new understanding of our experience. Thus, they can give new meaning to our pasts, to our daily activity, and to what we know and believe. To see how this is possible, let us consider the new metaphor LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART. This is a metaphor that we personally find particularly forceful, insightful, and appropriate, given our experiences as members of our generation and our culture. The reason is that it makes our experiences of love coherent—it makes sense of them. We would like to suggest that new metaphors make sense of our experience in the same way conventional metaphors do: they provide coherent structure, highlighting some things and hiding others. Like conventional metaphors, new metaphors have entailments, which may include other metaphors and literal statements as well. For example, the entailments of LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART arise from our beliefs about, and experiences of, what it means for something to be a collaborative work of art. Our personal views of work and art give rise to at least the following entailments for this metaphor: ((140)) Love is work. Love is active. Love requires cooperation. Love requires dedication. Love requires compromise. Love requires a discipline.\nLove involves shared responsibility. Love requires patience. Love requires shared values and goals. Love demands sacrifice. Love regularly brings frustration. Love requires instinctive communication. Love is an aesthetic experience. Love is primarily valued for its own sake. Love involves creativity. Love requires a shared aesthetic. Love cannot be achieved by formula. Love is unique in each instance. Love is an expression of who you are. Love creates a reality. Love reflects how you see the world. Love requires the greatest honesty. Love may be transient or permanent. Love needs funding. Love yields a shared aesthetic satisfaction from your joint efforts. Some of these entailments are metaphorical (e.g., \"Love is an aesthetic experience\"); others are not (e.g., \"Love involves shared responsibility\"). Each of these entailments may itself have further entailments. The result is a large and coherent network of entailments, which may, on the whole, either fit or not fit our experiences of love. When the net-work does fit, the experiences form a coherent whole as instances of the metaphor. What we experience with such a metaphor is a kind of reverberation down through the net-work of entailments that awakens and connects our memories of our past love experiences and serves as a pos- sible guide for future ones. ((141)) Let's be more specific about what we mean by \"reverberations\" in the metaphor LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART. First, the metaphor highlights certain features while sup-pressing others. For example, the active side of love is brought into the foreground through the notion of WORK both in COLLABORATIVE WORK and in WORK OF ART. This requires the masking of certain aspects of love that are viewed passively. In fact, the emotional aspects of love are almost never viewed as being under the lovers' active control in our conventional conceptual system. Even in the LOVE IS A JOURNEY metaphor, the relationship is viewed as a vehicle that is not in the couple's active control, since it can be off the tracks, or on the rocks, or not going any-where. In the LOVE IS MADNESS metaphor (\"I'm crazy about her,\" \"She's driving me wild\"), there is the ultimate lack of control. In the LOVE IS HEALTH metaphor, where the relationship is a patient (\"It's a healthy relationship,\" \"It's a sick relationship,\" \"Their relationship is reviving\"), the passivity of health in this culture is transferred to love. Thus, in focusing on various aspects of activity (e.g., WORK, CREATION, PURSUING GOALS, BUILDING, HELPING, etc.), the metaphor provides an organization of important love experiences that our conventional conceptual system does not make available. Second, the metaphor does not merely entail other concepts, like WORK Or PURSUING SHARED GOALS, but it entails very specific aspects of these concepts. It is not just any work, like working on an automobile assembly line, for instance. It is work that requires that special balance of control and letting-go that is appropriate to artistic creation, since the goal that is pursued is not just any kind of goal but a joint aesthetic goal. And though the\nmetaphor may sup-press the out-of-control aspects of the LOVE IS MADNESS metaphor, it highlights another aspect, namely, the sense of almost demonic possession that lies behind our culture's connection between artistic genius and madness. ((142)) Third, because the metaphor highlights important love experiences and makes them coherent while it masks other love experiences, the metaphor gives love a new meaning. If those things entailed by the metaphor are for us the most important aspects of our love experiences, then the metaphor can acquire the status of a truth; for many people, love is a collaborative work of art. And because it is, the metaphor can have a feedback effect, guiding our future actions in accordance with the metaphor. Fourth, metaphors can thus be appropriate because they sanction actions, justify inferences, and help us set goals. For example, certain actions, inferences, and goals are dictated by the LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART metaphor but not by the LOVE IS MADNESS metaphor. If love is madness, I do not concentrate on what I have to do to maintain it. But if it is work, then it requires activity, and if it is a work of art, it requires a very special kind of activity, and if it is collaborative, then it is even further restricted and specified. Fifth, the meaning a metaphor will have for me will be partly culturally determined and partly tied to my past experiences. The cultural differences can be enormous be-cause each of the concepts in the metaphor under discussion—ART, WORK, COLLABORATION, and LOVE—can vary widely from culture to culture. Thus, LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART would mean very different things to a nineteenth-century European Romantic and an Eskimo living in Greenland at the same time. There will also be differences within a culture based on how individu-als differ in their views of work and art. LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART Will mean something very different to two fourteen-year-olds on their first date than to a mature artist couple. As an example of how the meaning of a metaphor may vary radically within a culture, let us consider some entailments of the metaphor for someone with a view of art very different from our own. Someone who values a work of art ((143)) not for itself but only as an object for display and someone who thinks that art creates only an illusion, not reality, could see the following as entailments of the metaphor: Love is an object to be placed on display. Love exists to be judged and admired by others. Love creates an illusion.\nLove requires hiding the truth. Because such a person's view of art is different, the metaphor will have a different meaning for him. If his experience of love is pretty much like ours, then the metaphor simply will not fit. In fact, it will be grossly inappropriate. Hence, the same metaphor that gives new meaning to our experiences will not give new meaning to his. Another example of how a metaphor can create new meaning for us came about by accident. An Iranian student, shortly after his arrival in Berkeley, took a seminar on metaphor from one of us. Among the wondrous things that he found in Berkeley was an expression that he heard over and over and understood as a beautifully sane metaphor. The expression was \"the solution of my problems\"—which he took to be a large volume of liquid, bubbling and smoking, containing all of your problems, either dissolved or in the form of precipitates, with catalysts constantly dissolving some problems (for the time being) and precipitating out others. He was terribly disillusioned to find that the residents of Berkeley had no such chemical metaphor in mind. And well he might be, for the chemical metaphor is both beautiful and insightful. It gives us a view of problems as things that never disappear utterly and that cannot be solved once and for all. All of your problems are always present, only they may be dissolved and in solution, or they may be in solid form. The best you can hope for is to find a catalyst that will make one problem dissolve without mak-ing another one precipitate out. And since you do not have complete control over what goes into the solution, you are constantly finding old and new problems precipitating out ((144)) and present problems dissolving, partly because of your efforts and partly despite anything you do. The CHEMICAL metaphor gives us a new view of human problems. It is appropriate to the experience of finding that problems which we once thought were \"solved\" turn up again and again. The CHEMICAL metaphor says that problems are not the kind of things that can be made to dis-appear forever. To treat them as things that can be \"solved\" once and for all is pointless. To live by the CHEMICAL metaphor would be to accept it as a fact that no prob-lem ever disappears forever. Rather than direct your ener-gies toward solving your problems once and for all, you would direct your energies toward finding out what catalysts will dissolve your most pressing problems for the longest time without precipitating out worse ones. The re-appearance of a problem is viewed as a natural occurrence rather than a failure on your part to find \"the right way to solve it.\" To live by the CHEMICAL metaphor would mean that your problems have a different kind of reality for you. A temporary solution would be an accomplishment rather than a failure. Problems would be part of the natural order of things rather than disorders to be \"cured.\" The way you would understand your everyday life and the way you would act in it would be different if you lived by the CHEMCAL metaphor. We see this as a clear case of the power of metaphor to create a reality rather than simply to give us a way of conceptualizing a preexisting reality. This should not be sur-prising. As we saw in the case of the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor, there are natural kinds of activity (e.g., arguing) that are metaphorical in nature. What the CHEMICAL metaphor reveals is that our current way of dealing with problems is another kind of metaphorical activity. At present most of us deal with problems according to what we might call the PUZZLE metaphor, in\nwhich problems are PUZZLES for which, typically, there is a correct solution— ((145)) and, once solved, they are solved forever. The PROBLEMS ARE PUZZLES metaphor characterizes our present reality. A shift to the CHEMICAL metaphor would characterize a new reality. But it is by no means an easy matter to change the metaphors we live by. It is one thing to be aware of the possibilities inherent in the CHEMICAL metaphor, but it is a very different and far more difficult thing to live by it. Each of us has, consciously or unconsciously, identified hundreds of problems, and we are constantly at work on solutions for many of them—via the PUZZLE metaphor. So much of our unconscious everyday activity is structured in terms of the PUZZLE metaphor that we could not possibly make a quick or easy change to the CHEMICAL metaphor on the basis of a conscious decision. Many of our activities (arguing, solving problems, budgeting time, etc.) are metaphorical in nature. The metaphorical concepts that characterize those activities structure our present reality. New metaphors have the power to create a new reality. This can begin to happen when we start to comprehend our experience in terms of a metaphor, and it becomes a deeper reality when we begin to act in terms of it. If a new metaphor enters the conceptual system that we base our actions on, it will alter that conceptual system and the perceptions and actions that the system gives rise to. Much of cultural change arises from the introduction of new metaphorical concepts and the loss of old ones. For example, the Westernization of cultures throughout the world is partly a matter of introducing the TIME IS MONEY metaphor into those cultures. The idea that metaphors can create realities goes against most traditional views of metaphor. The reason is that metaphor has traditionally been viewed as a matter of mere language rather than primarily as a means of structuring our conceptual system and the kinds of everyday activities we perform. It is reasonable enough to assume that words alone don't change reality. But changes in our conceptual ((146)) system do change what is real for us and affect how we perceive the world and act upon those perceptions. The idea that metaphor is just a matter of language and can at best only describe reality stems from the view that what is real is wholly external to, and independent of, how human beings conceptualize the world—as if the study of reality were just the study of the physical world. Such a view of reality—so-called objective reality—leaves out human aspects of reality, in particular the real perceptions, conceptualizations, motivations, and actions that constitute most of what we experience. But the human\naspects of reality are most of what matters to us, and these vary from culture to culture, since different cultures have different conceptual systems. Cultures also exist within physical environments, some of them radically different jungles, deserts, islands, tundra, mountains, cities, etc. In each case there is a physical environment that we interact with, more or less successfully. The conceptual systems of various cultures partly depend on the physical environments they have developed in. Each culture must provide a more or less successful way of dealing with its environment, both adapting to it and changing it. Moreover, each culture must define a social reality within which people have roles that make sense to them and in terms of which they can function socially. Not surprisingly, the social reality defined by a culture affects its conception of physical reality. What is real for an individual as a member of a culture is a product both of his social reality and of the way in which that shapes his ex- perience of the physical world. Since much of our social reality is understood in metaphorical terms, and since our conception of the physical world is partly metaphorical, metaphor plays a very significant role in determining what is real for us. ((147)) 22. The Creation of Similarity We have seen that many of our experiences and activities are metaphorical in nature and that much of our conceptual system is structured by metaphor. Since we see similarities in terms of the categories of our conceptual system and in terms of the natural kinds of experiences we have (both of which may be metaphorical), it follows that many of the similarities that we perceive are a result of conventional metaphors that are part of our conceptual system. We have already seen this in the case of orientational metaphors. For example, the orientations MORE IS UP and HAPPY IS UP induce a similarity that we perceive between MORE and HAPPY that we do not see between LESS and HAPPY. Ontological metaphors also make similarities possible. We saw, for example, that the viewing of TIME and LABOR metaphorically as uniform SUBSTANCES allows us to view them both as being similar to physical resources and hence as similar to each other. Thus the metaphors\nTIME IS A SUBSTANCE and LABOR IS A SUBSTANCE allow us to conceive of time and labor as similar in our culture, since both can be quantified, assigned a value per unit, seen as serving a purposeful end, and used up progressively. Since these metaphors play a part in defining what is real for us in this culture, the similarity between time and labor is both based on metaphor and real for our culture. Structural metaphors in our conceptual system also in-duce similarities. Thus, the IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor establishes similarities between ideas and food. Both can be digested, swallowed, devoured, and warmed over, and both ((148)) can nourish you. These similarities do not exist in-dependently of the metaphor. The concept of swallowing food is independent of the metaphor, but the concept of swallowing ideas arises only by virtue of the metaphor. In fact, the IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor is based on still more basic metaphors. For example, it is based partly on the CONDUIT metaphor, according to which IDEAS ARE OBJECTS and we can get them from outside ourselves. It also assumes the MIND IS A CONTAINER metaphor, which establishes a similarity between the mind and the body—both being CONTAINERS. Together with the CONDUIT metaphor, we get a complex metaphor in which IDEAS ARE OBJECTS THAT COME INTO THE MIND, just as pieces of food are objects that come into the body. It is this metaphorically created similarity between ideas and food that the IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor is partly based on. And, as we have seen, the similarity itself is a consequence of the CONDUIT metaphor and the MIND IS A CONTAINER metaphor. The IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor fits our experience partly because of this metaphor-induced similarity. The IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor is therefore partly grounded via the MIND IS A CONTAINER and CONDUIT metaphors. As a consequence of the IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor, we get new (metaphorical) similarities between IDEAS and FOOD: both can be swallowed, digested, and devoured, and both can nourish you. These food concepts give us a way of understanding psychological processes that we have no direct and well-defined way of conceptualizing. Finally, we can see the creation of similarity in new metaphors as well. For example, the metaphor PROBLEMS ARE PRECIPITATES IN A CHEMICAL SOLUTION iS based on the conventional metaphor PROBLEMS ARE OBJECTS. In addition, the CHEMICAL metaphor adds PROBLEMS ARE SOLID OBJECTS, which identifies them as the precipitates in a chemical solution. The similarities thus induced between problems as we usually experience them and precipitates in a chemical solution are: they both have a perceptible form\n((149)) and thus can be identified, analyzed, and acted upon. These similarities are induced by the PROBLEMS ARE SOLID OBJECTS part of the CHEMICAL metaphor. In addition, when a precipitate is dissolved, it appears to be gone because it does not have a perceptible form and cannot be identified, III analyzed, and acted upon. However, it may precipitate out again, i.e., recur in solid form, just as a problem may recur. We perceive this similarity between problems and precipitates as a result of the rest of the CHEMICAL metaphor. A more subtle example of the similarities created by a new metaphor can be seen in LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART. This metaphor highlights certain aspects of love experiences, downplays others, and hides still others. In particular, it downplays those experiences that fit the LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE metaphor. By \"downplaying,\" we mean that it is consistent with, but does not focus on, experiences of love that could be reasonably described by \"There is a magnetism between us,\" \"We felt sparks,\" etc. Moreover, it hides those love experiences that fit the LOVE IS WAR metaphor because there is no consistent overlap possible between the two metaphors. The collaborative and cooperative aspects of the LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART metaphor are inconsistent with (and therefore hide) the aggressive and dominance-oriented aspects of our love experiences as they might be described by \"She is my latest conquest,\" \"He surrendered to her,\" \"She overwhelmed me,\" etc. By this means, the LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART metaphor puts aside some of our love experiences and picks out others to focus on as if they were our only experiences of love. In doing so it induces a set of similarities between the love experiences it highlights and the real or imagined experiences of collaborating on a work of art. These induced similarities are given in our list of entailments (\"Love is work,\" \"Love is an aesthetic experience,\" etc.). Within the range of highlighted love experiences, each ((150)) experience fits at least one of the similarities given in the list of entailments, and probably no one of them fits all the entailments. For example, a particularly frustrating episode would fit \"Love regularly brings frustration\" but might not fit \"Love is an aesthetic experience\" or \"Love is primarily valued for its own sake.\" Each entailment thus states a similarity that holds between certain types of love experiences, on the one hand, and certain types of experiences of collaborative works of art, on the other. No one entailment shows the overall similarity between the entire range of highlighted love experiences and the range of experiences involved in producing a collaborative work of art. It is only the whole metaphor, with its entire system of entailments, that shows the similarities between the full\nrange of high-lighted love experiences and the full range of experiences of producing a collaborative work of art. Moreover, there is a similarity induced by the metaphor that goes beyond the mere similarities between the two ranges of experience. The additional similarity is a structural similarity. It involves the way we understand how the individual highlighted experiences fit together in a coherent way. The coherence is provided by the structure of what we know about producing a collaborative work of art and is reflected in the way the entailments fit together (e.g., some are entailments of WORK, some are entailments of ART, some are entailments of COLLABORATIVE WORK, etc.). It is only this coherent structure that enables us to understand what the highlighted experiences have to do with each other and how the entailments are related to each other. Thus, by virtue of the metaphor, the range of highlighted love experiences is seen as similar in structure to the range of experiences of producing a collaborative work of art. It is this structural similarity between the two ranges of experience that allows you to find coherence in the range of highlighted love experiences. Correspondingly, it is by virtue of the metaphor that the highlighted range of experi- ((151)) ences is picked out as being coherent. Without the metaphor, this range of experiences does not exist for you as being an identifiable and coherent set of experiences. Conceptualizing LOVE as A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART brings them into focus as fitting together into a coherent whole. Moreover, the metaphor, by virtue of giving coherent structure to a range of our experiences, creates similarities of a new kind. For example, we might, independently of the metaphor, see a frustrating love experience as similar to a frustrating experience in producing a work of art jointly with someone, since they are both frustrating. In this sense, the frustrating love experience would also be similar to any frustrating experience at all. What the metaphor adds to an understanding of the frustrating love experience is that the kind of frustration involved is that involved in producing collaborative artworks. The similarity is similarity with respect to the metaphor. Thus the precise nature of the similarity between the frustrating love experience and the frustrating art experience is perceived only in understanding the love experience in terms of the art experience. Understanding love experiences in terms of what is involved in producing a collaborative work of art is, by our definition, to comprehend that experience in terms of the metaphorical concept LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART. We can summarize the ways in which metaphors create similarities as follows: 1. Conventional metaphors (orientational, ontological, and structural) are often based on correlations we perceive in our experience. For example, in an industrial culture such as ours there is a correlation between the amount of time a task takes and the amount of labor it takes to accomplish the task. This correlation is part of what allows us to view TIME and LABOR metaphorically as RESOURCES and hence to see a similarity between them. It is important to\n((152)) remember that correlations are not similarities. Metaphors that are based on correlations in our experience define concepts in terms of which we perceive similarities. 2.Conventional metaphors of the structural variety (e.g., IDEAS ARE FOOD) may be based on similarities that arise out of orientational and ontological metaphors. As we saw, for example, IDEAS ARE FOOD is based on IDEAS ARE OBJECTS (ontological) and THE MIND IS A CONTAINER (ontological and orientational). A structural similarity between IDEAS and FOOD is induced by the metaphor and gives rise to metaphorical similarities (ideas and food can be swallowed, digested, and devoured, can provide nourishment, etc.). 3.New metaphors are mostly structural. They can create similarities in the same way as conventional metaphors that are structural. That is, they can be based on similarities that arise from ontological and orientational metaphors. As we saw, PROBLEMS ARE PRECIPITATES IN A CHEMICAL SOLUTION iS based on the physical metaphor PROBLEMS ARE SOLID OBJECTS. This metaphor creates similarities between PROBLEMS and PRECIPITATES, since both can be identified, analyzed, and acted upon. The PROBLEMS ARE PRECIPITATES metaphor creates new similarities, namely, problems can appear to be gone (dissolve into solutions) and later reappear (precipitate out). 4.New metaphors, by virtue of their entailments, pick out a range of experiences by highlighting, downplaying, and hiding. The metaphor then characterizes a similarity between the entire range of highlighted experiences and some other range of experiences. For example, LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART picks out a certain range of our love experiences and defines a structural similarity between the entire range of highlighted experiences and the range of experiences involved in producing collaborative works of art. There may be isolated similarities between love and art experiences that are independent of the metaphor, but the metaphor allows us to find coherence in ((153)) these isolated similarities in terms of the overall structural similarities induced by the metaphor. 5. Similarities may be similarities with respect to a metaphor. As we saw, the LOVE IS A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF ART metaphor defines a unique kind of similarity. For example, a frustrating love experience may be understood as being similar to a frustrating art experience not merely by virtue of being frustrating but as involving the kind of frus-tration peculiar to jointly producing works of art. Our view that metaphors can create similarities runs counter to the classical and still most widely held theory of metaphor, namely, the comparison theory. The comparison theory says: 1.Metaphors are matters of language and not matters of thought or action. There is no such thing as metaphorical thought or action. 2.A metaphor of the form \"A is B\" is a linguistic expression whose meaning is the same as a corresponding linguistic expression of the form \"A is like B, in respects X, Y, Z ....\" \"Respects X, Y, Z, ... \" characterize what we have called \"isolated similarities.\"\n3.A metaphor can therefore only describe preexisting similarities. It cannot create similarities. Though we have given evidence against much of the comparison theory, we accept what we take to be its basic insight, namely, that metaphors can be based on isolated similarities. We differ with the comparison theory by maintaining that: 1. Metaphor is primarily a matter of thought and action and only derivatively a matter of language. 2.a. Metaphors can be based on similarities, though in many cases these similarities are themselves based on conventional metaphors that are not based on similarities. Similarities based on conventional metaphors are nonetheless real in our culture, since conventional metaphors partly define what we find real. ((154)) 2.b. Though the metaphor may be based partly on isolated similarities, we see the important similarities as those created by the metaphor, as described above. 3. The primary function of metaphor is to provide a partial understanding of one kind of experience in terms of another kind of experience. This may involve preexisting isolated similarities, the creation of new similarities, and more. It is important to bear in mind that the comparison theory most often goes hand in hand with an objectivist philosophy in which all similarities are objective, that is, they are similarities inherent in the entities themselves. We argue, on the contrary, that the only similarities relevant to metaphor are similarities as experienced by people. The difference between objective similarities and experiential similarities is all-important, and is discussed in detail in chapter 27. Briefly, an objectivist would say that objects have the properties they have independently of anyone who experiences them; the objects are objectively similar if they share those properties. To an objectivist it would make no sense to speak of metaphors as \"creating similarities,\" since that would require metaphors to be able to change the nature of the external world, bringing into existence objective similarities that did not previously exist. We agree with objectivists on one major point: that things in the world do play a role in constraining our conceptual system. But they play this role only through our experience of them. Our experiences will (1) differ from culture to culture and (2) may depend on our understanding one kind of experience in terms of another, that is, our experiences may be metaphorical in nature. Such experiences determine the categories of our conceptual system. And properties and similarities, we maintain, exist and can be experienced only relative to a conceptual system. Thus, the only kind of similarities relevant to metaphors are experiential, not objective, similarities. Our general position is that conceptual metaphors are ((155))\ngrounded in correlations within our experience. These experiential correlations may be of two types: experiential cooccurrence and experiential similarity. An example of experiential cooccurrence would be the MORE IS UP metaphor. MORE IS UP is grounded in the cooccurrence of two types of experiences: adding more of a substance and seeing the level of the substance rise. Here there is no experiential similarity at all. An example of experiential similarity is LIFE IS A GAMBLING GAME, where one experiences actions in life as gambles, and the possible consequences of those actions are perceived as winning or losing. Here the metaphor seems to be grounded in experiential similarity. When such a metaphor is extended, we may experience new similarities between life and gambling games.\n((156)) 23. Metaphor, Truth, and Action In the preceding chapter we suggested the following: Metaphors have entailments through which they highlight and make coherent certain aspects of our experience. A given metaphor may be the only way to highlight and coherently organize exactly those aspects of our experience.\nMetaphors may create realities for us, especially social realities. A metaphor may thus be a guide for future action. Such actions will, of course, fit the metaphor. This will, in turn, reinforce the power of the metaphor to make experience coherent. In this sense metaphors can be self- fulfilling prophecies. For example, faced with the energy crisis, President Carter declared \"the moral equivalent of war.\" The WAR metaphor generated a network of entailments. There was an \"enemy,\" a \"threat to national security,\" which required \"setting targets,\" \"reorganizing priorities,\" \"establishing a new chain of command,\" \"plotting new strategy,\" \"gathering intelligence,\" \"marshaling forces,\" \"imposing sanctions,\" \"calling for sacrifices,\" and on and on. The WAR metaphor highlighted certain realities and hid others. The metaphor was not merely a way of viewing reality; it constituted a license for policy change and political and economic action. The very acceptance of the metaphor provided grounds for certain inferences: there was an external, foreign, hostile enemy (pictured by cartoonists in Arab headdress); energy needed to be given top priorities; the populace would have to make sacrifices; if we didn't meet ((157)) the threat, we would not survive. It is important to realize that this was not the only metaphor available. Carter's WAR metaphor took for granted our current concept of what ENERGY is, and focused on how to get enough of it. On the other hand, Amory Lovins (1977) observed that there are two fundamentally different ways, or PATHS, to supply our energy needs. He characterized these metaphorically as HARD and SOFT. The HARD ENERGY PATH uses energy supplies that are inflexible, nonrenewable, needing military defense and geopolitical control, irreversibly destructive of the environment, and requiring high capital investment, high technology, and highly skilled workers. They include fossil fuels (gas and oil), nuclear power . plants, and coal gasification. The SOFT ENERGY PATH uses energy supplies that are flexible, renewable, not needing military defense or geopolitical control, not destructive of the environment, and requiring only low capital investment, low technology, and unskilled labor. They include solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, biomass alcohol, fluidized beds for burning coal or other combustible materials, and a great many other possibilities currently available. Lovins' SOFT ENERGY PATH metaphor highlights the technical, economic, and sociopolitical structure of the energy system, which leads him to the conclusion that the \"hard\" energy paths—coal, oil, and nuclear power—lead to political conflict, economic hardship, and harm to the environment. But Jimmy Carter is more powerful than Amory Lovins. As Charlotte Linde (in conversation) has observed, whether in national politics or in everyday interaction, people in power get to impose their metaphors. New metaphors, like conventional metaphors, can have the power to define reality. They do this through a coherent network of entailments that highlight some features of reality and hide others. The acceptance of the metaphor, which forces us to focus only on those aspects of our experience that it highlights, leads us to view the entailments of the metaphor as being true. Such \"truths\" may be true, r,\n((158)) of course, only relative to the reality defined by the metaphor. Suppose Carter announces that his administration has won a major energy battle. Is this claim true or false? Even to address oneself to the question requires accepting at least the central parts of the metaphor. If you do not accept the existence of an external enemy, if you think there is no external threat, if you recognize no field of battle, no targets, no clearly defined competing forces, then the issue of objective truth or falsity cannot arise. But if you see reality as defined by the metaphor, that is, if you do see the energy crisis as a war, then you can answer the question relative to whether the metaphorical entailments fit reality. If Carter, by means of strategically employed political and economic sanctions, forced the OPEC nations to cut the price of oil in half, then you would say that he would indeed have won a major battle. If, on the other hand, his strategies had produced only a temporary price freeze, you couldn't be so sure and might be skeptical. Though questions of truth do arise for new metaphors, the more important questions are those of appropriate ac-tion. In most cases, what is at issue is not the truth or falsity of a metaphor but the perceptions and inferences that follow from it and the actions that are sanctioned by it. In all aspects of life, not just in politics or in love, we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors. We draw inferences, set goals, make commitments, and execute plans, all on the basis of how we in part structure our experience, consciously and unconsciously, by means of metaphor. ((159)) 24. Truth Why Care about a Theory of Truth? Metaphors, as we have seen, are conceptual in nature. They are among our principal\nvehicles for understanding. And they play a central role in the construction of social and political reality. Yet they are typically viewed within philosophy as matters of \"mere language,\" and philosophical discussions of metaphor have not centered on their conceptual nature, their contribution to understanding, or their function in cultural reality. Instead, philosophers have tended to look at metaphors as out-of-the-ordinary imaginative or poetic linguistic expressions, and their discussions have centered on whether these linguistic expressions can be true. Their concern with truth comes out of a concern with objectivity: truth for them means objective, absolute truth. The typical philosophical conclusion is that metaphors cannot directly state truths, and, if they can state truths at all, it is only indirectly, via some non-metaphorical \"literal\" paraphrase. We do not believe that there is such a thing as objective (absolute and unconditional) truth, though it has been a long-standing theme in Western culture that there is. We do believe that there are truths but think that the idea of truth need not be tied to the objectivist view. We believe that the idea that there is absolute objective truth is not only mistaken but socially and politically dangerous. As we have seen, truth is always relative to a conceptual system that is defined in large part by metaphor. Most of our metaphors have evolved in our culture over a long period, but many ((160)) are imposed upon us by people in power—political leaders, religious leaders, business leaders, advertisers, the media, etc. In a culture where the myth of objectivism is very much alive and truth is always absolute truth, the people who get to impose their metaphors on the culture get to define what we consider to be true—absolutely and objectively true. It is for this reason that we see it as important to give an account of truth that is free of the myth of objectivism (according to which truth is always absolute truth). Since we see truth as based on understanding and see metaphor as a principal vehicle of understanding, we think that an ac-count of how metaphors can be true will reveal the way in which truth depends upon understanding. The Importance of Truth in Our Daily Lives We base our actions, both physical and social, on what we take to be true. On the whole, truth matters to us because it has survival value and allows us to function in our world. Most of the truths we accumulate—about our bodies, the people we interact with, and our immediate physical and social environments—play a role in daily functioning. They are truths so obvious that it takes a conscious effort to become aware of them: where the front door of the house is, what you can and can't eat, where the nearest gas station is, what stores sell the things you need, what your friends are like, what it would take to insult them, what responsibilities you have. This tiny sample suggests the na-ture and extent of the vast body of truths that play a role in our daily lives. The Role of Projection in Truth In order to acquire such truths and to make use of them, we need an understanding of our world sufficient for our needs. As we have seen, some of this understanding is cast in terms of categories that emerge from our direct experience:\n((161)) orientational categories, concepts like OBJECT, SUBSTANCE, PURPOSE, CAUSE, etc. We have also seen that when the categories that emerge from direct physical experience do not apply, we sometimes project these categories onto aspects of the physical world that we have less direct experience of. For example, we project a front-back orientation in context onto objects that have no intrinsic fronts or backs. Given a medium-sized rock in our visual field and a ball between us and the rock, say, a foot from it, we would perceive the ball as being in front of the rock. The Hausas make a different projection than we do and would under-stand the ball as being in back of the rock. Thus, a front-back orientation is not an inherent property of objects like rocks but rather an orientation that we project onto them, and the way we do this varies from culture to culture. Relative to our purposes, we can conceive of things in the world as being containers or not. We can, for example, conceive of a clearing in a forest as being a CONTAINER and under-stand ourselves as being IN the clearing, or OUT OF it. Being a container is not an inherent property of that place in the woods where the trees are less dense; it is a property that we project onto it relative to the way we function with respect to it. Relative to other perceptions and purposes, we can view the rest of the forest outside the clearing as a different container and perceive ourselves as being IN the forest. And we can do both simultaneously and speak of EMERGING FROM the forest INTO the clearing. Similarly, our on-off orientation emerges from our direct experience with the ground, floors, and other horizontal surfaces. Typically, we are on the ground, floor, etc., if we are standing on it with our bodies erect. We also project on-off orientations onto walls and conceive of a fly as standing on the wall if its legs are in contact with it and its head is oriented away from the wall. The same carries over to the fly on the ceiling: we conceive of it as being on rather than under the ceiling. As we have also seen, we perceive various things in the ((162)) natural world as entities, often projecting boundaries and surfaces on them where no clear- cut boundaries or surfaces exist naturally. Thus we can conceive of a fogbank as an entity that can be over the bay (which we conceive as an entity) and in front of the mountain (conceived as an entity with a FRONT-BACK orientation). By virtue of these projections, a sentence like \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" may be true. As is typically the case in our daily lives, truth is relative to understanding, and the truth of such a sentence is relative to the normal way we understand the world by projecting orientation and entity structure onto it. The Role of Categorization in Truth In order to understand the world and function in it, we have to categorize, in ways that make sense to us, the things and experiences that we encounter. Some of our categories emerge directly from our experience, given the way our bodies are and the nature of our interactions with other people and with our physical and social environments. As we saw in\nour discussion of the FAKE GUN example in chapter 19, there are natural dimensions to our categories for objects: perceptual, based on the conception of the object by means of our sensory apparatus; motor activity, based on the nature of motor interactions with objects; functional, based on our conception of the functions of the object; and purposive, based on the uses we can make of an object in a given situation. Our categories for kinds of objects are thus gestalts with at least these natural dimensions, each of which specifies interactional properties. Similarly, there are natural dimensions in terms of which we categorize events, activities, and other experiences as structured wholes. As we saw in our discussion of CONVERSATION and ARGUMENT, these natural dimensions include participants, parts, stages, linear sequence, purpose, and causation. ((163)) A categorization is a natural way of identifying a kind of object or experience by highlighting certain properties, downplaying others, and hiding still others. Each of the dimensions gives the properties that are highlighted. To highlight certain properties is necessarily to downplay or hide others, which is what happens whenever we categorize something. Focusing on one set of properties shifts our attention away from others. When we give everyday descriptions, for example, we are using categorizations to focus on certain properties that fit our purposes. Every description will highlight, downplay, and hide—for example: I've invited a sexy blonde to our dinner party. I've invited a renowned cellist to our dinner party. I've invited a Marxist to our dinner party. I've invited a lesbian to our dinner party. Though the same person may fit all of these descriptions, each description highlights different aspects of the person. Describing someone who you know has all of these prop- erties as \"a sexy blonde\" is to downplay the fact that she is a renowned cellist and a Marxist and to hide her lesbianism. In general, the true statements that we make are based on the way we categorize things and, therefore, on what is highlighted by the natural dimensions of the categories. In making a statement, we make a choice of categories be-cause we have some reason for focusing on certain properties and downplaying others. Every true statement, therefore, necessarily leaves out what is downplayed or hidden by the categories used in it. Moreover, since the natural dimensions of categories (perceptual, functional, etc.) arise out of our interactions with the world, the properties given by those dimensions are not properties of objects in themselves but are, rather, interactional properties, based on the human perceptual apparatus, human conceptions of function, etc. It follows from this that true statements made in terms of human ((164))\ncategories typically do not predicate properties of objects in themselves but rather interactional properties that make sense only relative to human functioning. In making a true statement, we have to choose categories of description, and that choice involves our perceptions and our purposes in the given situation. Suppose you say to me, \"We're having a discussion group over tonight, and I need four more chairs. Can you bring them?\" I say \"Sure,\" and show up with a hardback chair, a rocking chair, a beanbag chair, and a hassock. Leaving them in your living room, I report to you in the kitchen, \"I brought the four chairs you wanted.\" In this situation, my statement is true, since the four objects I've brought will serve the purpose of chairs for an informal discussion group. Had you instead asked me to bring four chairs for a formal dinner and I show up with the same four objects and make the same statement, you will not be appropriately grateful and will find the statement misleading or false, since the hassock, beanbag chair, and rocker are not practical as \"chairs\" at a formal dinner. This shows that our categories (e.g., CHAIR) are not rigidly fixed in terms of inherent properties of the objects themselves. What counts as an instance of a category de-pends on our purpose in using the category. This is the same point we made above, in our discussion of Definition, where we showed that categories are defined for purposes of human understanding by prototypes and family resemblances to those prototypes. Such categories are not fixed but may be narrowed, expanded, or adjusted relative to our purposes and other contextual factors. Since the truth of a statement depends on whether the categories employed in the statement fit, the truth of a statement will always be relative to the way the category is understood for our purposes in a given context. There are many celebrated examples to show that sentences, in general, are not true or false independent of human purposes: ((165)) France is hexagonal. Missouri is a parallelogram. The earth is a sphere. Italy is boot-shaped. An atom is a tiny solar system with the nucleus at the center and electrons whirling around it. Light consists of particles. Light consists of waves. Each of these sentences is true for certain purposes, in certain respects, and in certain contexts. \"France is a hexagon\" and \"Missouri is a parallelogram\" can be true for a schoolboy who has to draw rough maps but not for professional cartographers. \"The earth is a sphere\" is true as far as most of us are concerned, but it won't do for precisely plotting the orbit of a satellite. No self-respecting physicist has believed since 1914 that an atom is a tiny solar system, but it is true for most of us relative to our everyday functioning and our general level of sophistication in mathematics and physics. \"Light consists of particles\" seems to contradict \"Light consists of waves,\" but both are taken as true by physicists relative to which aspects of light are picked out by different experiments.\nWhat all of this shows is that truth depends on categorization in the following four ways: —A statement can be true only relative to some understanding of it. —Understanding always involves human categorization, which is a function of interactional (rather than inherent) properties and of dimensions that emerge from our experience. —The truth of a statement is always relative to the properties that are highlighted by the categories used in the statement. (For example, \"Light consists of waves\" highlights wavelike properties of light and hides particle-like properties.) —Categories are neither fixed nor uniform. They are defined by prototypes and family resemblances to prototypes and are ((166)) adjustable in context, given various purposes. Whether a statement is true depends on whether the category employed in the statement fits, and this in turn varies with human pur-poses and other aspects of context. What Does It Take to Understand a Simple Sentence as Being True? To understand a sentence as being true, we must first understand it. Let us look at part of what is involved in understanding such simple sentences as \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" and \"John fired the gun at Harry.\" Sentences like these are always uttered as part of discourses of some kind, and understanding them in a discourse context involves complications of a nontrivial sort that, for our pur-poses, we must ignore here. But, even ignoring some of the complexities of discourse context, any understanding of such sentences involves quite a bit. Consider what must be the case for us to understand \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" as being true. As we saw above, we have to view \"the fog\" and \"the mountain\" as entities, by means of projection, and we must project a front-back orientation on the mountain—an orientation which varies from culture to culture, is given relative to a human observer, and is not inherent in the mountain. We must then determine, relative to our purposes, whether what we view as \"the fog\" is pretty much between us and what we pick out as \"the mountain,\" closer to the mountain, and not to the side of the mountain, or above it, etc. There are three projections onto the world plus some pragmatic determinations, relative to our perceptions and purposes, as to whether the relation in front of is more appropriate than other possible relations. Thus, understanding whether \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" is true is not merely a matter of (a) picking out preexisting and well-defined entities in the world (the fog and the mountain) and (h) seeing whether some inherent relation (independent of any human observer) holds be- ((167)) tween these well-defined entities. Instead, it is a matter of human projection and human judgment, relative to certain purposes. \"John fired the gun at Harry\" raises other issues. There are the obvious matters of picking out people named John and Harry, picking out the object that fits the category GUN, understanding what it means to fire a gun and to fire it at someone. But we don't understand sentences like this in tvacrro. We understand them relative to certain larger categories of experience, for example, shooting someone, scaring someone, performing a circus act, or pretending to do any of these in a play or film or joke. Firing a gun can be an instance\nof any of these, and which is applicable will depend on the context. But there is only a small range of categories of experience that firing a gun fits into, the most typical of which is SHOOTING SOMEONE, since there are many typical ways to scare someone or perform a circus act but only one normal way to shoot someone. We can thus view SHOOTING SOMEONE as an experiential gestalt with roughly the following dimensions, in this in-stance: Participants: John (shooter), Harry (trget), the gun (instrumerit), the bullet (instrrrnwnt, missile) Parts: Aiming the gun at the target Firing the gun Bullet hits target Target is wounded stages: Precondition: Shooter has loaded gun Beginning: Shooter aims gun at target Middle: Shooter fires gun End: Bullet hits target Final state: Target is wounded Causation: Beginning and middle enable end Middle and end cause final state Purpose: Goal: Final state Plan: Meet precondition, perform be-ginning and middle The sentence \"John fired the gun at Harry\" typically ((168)) evokes a SHOOTING SOMEONE gestalt of this form. Or it could, in other contexts, evoke other equally complex experiential gestalts (e.g., PERFORMING A CIRCUS ACT). But the sentence is virtually never understood on its own terms without the evocation of some larger gestalt that specifies the normal range of natural dimensions (e.g., purpose, stages, etc.). Whichever gestalt is evoked, we understand much more than is given directly in the sentence. Each such gestalt provides a background for understanding the sentence in terms that make sense to us, that is, in terms of an experiential category of our culture. In addition to the larger category of experience evoked by the sentence, we also categorize FIRING and GUN in terms of information-rich prototypes. Unless the context forces us to do otherwise, we understand the gun to be a prototypical gun, with the usual prototypical perceptual, motor, .functional, and purpose properties. Unless the context specifies otherwise, the image evoked is not that of an umbrella gun or a suitcase gun, and the motor program used in firing is holding the gun horizontal and squeezing the trigger, which is the normal motor program that fits both FIRING and GUN. Unless the context is rigged, we do not imagine a Rube Goldberg device in which the trigger is tied by a string to, say, a door handle. We understand the sentence in terms of the way these gestalts fit together, both the \"smaller\" gestalts (GUN, FIR-ING, AIMING, etc.) and the \"larger\" gestalts (SHOOTING SOMEONE Or PERFORMING A CIRCUS ACT). Only relative to such understandings do issues of truth arise. Thp issue of truth is straightforward when our understanding of the sentence in these terms fits closely enough our under-standing of the events that have ocFurred. But what hap-pens when there is a discrepancy' between our normal understanding of the sentence and our understanding of the events? Say, for example, that John, in an ingenious Rube Goldberg fashion, set up the gun so that it would be aimed at a point where Harry would be at some time and then tied a string to the trigger. Let's take two cases:\n((169)) iu i'c A.John's scratching his ear causes the gun to fire at Harry. B.Harry's opening the door causes the gun to fire at Harry. In case A, John's action is responsible for the firing, while, in B, Harry's action is. This makes A closer than B to our normal understanding of the sentence. Thus, we might, if pressed, be willing to say that A is a case where it would be true to say \"John fired the gun at Harry.\" Case B, how-ever, is so far from our prototypical understanding of firing that we would probably not want to say that it was true that \"John fired the gun at Harry.\" But we would not want to say that it was unqualifiedly false either, since John was primarily responsible for the shooting. Instead, we'd want to explain, not just answer \"True\" or \"False.\" This is what typically happens when our understanding of the events does not fit our normal understanding of the sentence be-cause of some deviation from a prototype. We can summarize the results of this section as follows: 1.Understanding a sentence as being true in a given situation requires having an understanding of the sentence and having an understanding of the situation. 2.We understand a sentence as being true when our under-standing of the sentence fits our understanding of the situation closely enough. 3.Getting an understanding of a situation of the sort that could fit our understanding of a sentence may require: a. Projecting an orientation onto something that has no inherent orientation (e.g., viewing the mountain as having a front) b Projecting an entity structure onto something that is not bounded in any clear sense (e.g., the fog, the mountain) c.Providing a background in terms of which the sentence makes sense, that is, calling up an experiential gestalt (e.g., SHOOTING SOMEONE, PERFORMING A CIRCUS ACT) and understanding the situation in terms of the gestalt d.Getting a \"normal\" understanding of the sentence in terms of its categories (e.g., GUN, FIRING), as defined by prototype, and trying to get an understanding of the situation in terms of the same categories ((170)) What Does It Take to Understand a Conventional Metaphor as Being True? We have seen what is involved in understanding a simple sentence (without metaphor) as being true. We now want to suggest that adding conventional metaphors changes nothing. We understand them as being true in basically the same way. Take a sentence like \"Inflation has gone up.\" Under-standing a situation as one in which this sentence could be true involves two projections. We have to pick out in-stances of inflation and view them as constituting a sub-stance, which we can then quantify and thereby view as increasing. In addition we have to project an up orientation on the increase. These two projections constitute two conventional metaphors: INFLATION IS A SUBSTANCE (an ontological metaphor) and MORE IS UP (an orientational metaphor). There is one principal difference between the projections onto the situation in this case and in the case given above, namely, \"The fog is in front of the mountain.\" In the case of fog, we are understanding something physical (fog) on the model of something else physical but more clearly delineated—a bounded physical\nobject. In the case of,front, we are understanding the physical orientation of the mountain in terms of another physical orientation—that of our bodies. In both cases, we are understanding some-thing that is physical in terms of something else that is also physical. In other words, we are understanding one thing in terms of something else of the same kind. But in conventional metaphor, we are understanding one thing in terms of something else of a different kind. In \"Inflation has gone up,\" for example, we understand inflation (which is abstract) in terms of a physical substance, and we under-stand an increase of inflation (which is also abstract) in terms of a physical orientation (up). The only difference is whether our projection involves the same kinds of things or different kinds of things. When we understand a sentence like \"Inflation has gone up\" as being true, we do the following: ((171)) 1. We understand the situation by metaphorical projection in two ways: a.We view inflation as a SUBSTANCE (via an ontological metaphor). b.We view MORE as being oriented up (via an orientational metaphor). 2. We understand the sentence in terms of the same two metaphors. 3. This allows us to fit our understanding of the sentence to our understanding of the situation. Thus an understanding of truth in terms of metaphorical projection is not essentially different from an understanding of truth in terms of nonmetaphorical projection. The only difference is that metaphorical projection involves under-standing one kind of thing in terms of another kind of thing. That is, metaphorical projection involves two different kinds of things, while nonmetaphorical projection involves only one kind. The same holds for structural metaphors, also. Take a sentence like \"John defended his position in the argument.\" As we saw above, the experience of arguing is structured partially in terms of the WAR gestalt, by virtue of the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor. Since argument is a metaphorical kind of experience, structured by the conventional metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR, it follows that a situation in which there is an argument may be understood in these metaphorical terms. Our understanding of an argument situation will involve viewing it simultaneously in terms of both the CONVERSATION gestalt and the WAR gestalt. If our understanding of the situation is such that a portion of the conversation fits a successful defense in the WAR gestalt, then our understanding of the sentence will fit our understanding of the situation and we will take the sentence to be true. In both the metaphorical and nonmetaphorical cases, our account of how we understand truth depends on our ac-count of how we understand situations. Given that metaphor is conceptual in nature rather than a matter of ((172))\n\"mere language,\" it is natural for us to conceptualize situations in metaphorical terms. Because we can conceptualize situations in metaphorical terms, it is possible for sentences containing metaphors to be taken as fitting the situations as we conceptualize them. How Do We Understand New Metaphors as Being True? We have just seen that conventional metaphors fit our ac-count of truth in the same way as nonmetaphorical sentences do. In both cases, understanding a sentence as true in a given situation involves fitting our understanding of the sentence to our understanding of the situation. Because our understanding of situations may involve conventional meta- phor, sentences with conventional metaphors raise no special problems for our account of truth. This suggests that the same account of truth should work for new, or noncon- ventional, metaphors. To see this, let us consider two related metaphors, one conventional and one nonconventional: Tell me the story of your life. (conventional) Life's . . . a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. (nonconventional) Let us start with \"Tell me the story of your life,\" which contains the conventional metaphor LIFE IS A STORY. This is a metaphor rooted deep in our culture. It is assumed that everyone's life is structured like a story, and the entire bio-graphical and autobiographical tradition is based on this assumption. Suppose someone asks you to tell your life story. What do you do? You construct a coherent narrative that starts early in your life and continues up to the present. Typically the narrative will have the following features: Participants: You and other people who have \"played a role\" in your life Parts: Settings, significant facts, episodes, and ((173)) significant states (including the present state and some original state) Stages: Preconditions: Setting for the beginning Beginning: The original state followed by episodes in the same temporal setting Middle: Various episodes and significant states, in succeeding temporal order. End: Present state Linear sequence: Various temporal and/or causal connections among the succeeding episodes and states Causation: Various causal relations between episodes and states Purpose: Goal: A desired state (which may be in the future) Plan: A sequence of episodes which you initiate and which have a causal connection to the goal or: An event or set of events that puts you in a significant state, so that you will reach the goal through a series of natural stages This is a much oversimplified version of a typical experiential gestalt for giving coherence to one's life by viewing it as a STORY. We have omitted various complexities, such as the fact that each episode may in itself be a coherent sub-narrative with a similar structure. Not all life stories will contain all of these dimensions of structure. Notice that understanding your life in terms of a coherent life story involves highlighting certain participants and parts (episodes and states) and ignoring or hiding others. It involves\nseeing your life in terms of stages, causal connections among the parts, and plans meant to achieve a goal or a set of goals. In general, a life story imposes a coherent structure on elements of your life that are high-lighted. If you tell such a story and then say, \"That is the story of my life,\" you will legitimately see yourself as telling the truth if you do, in fact, view the highlighted participants and events as the significant ones and do, in fact, perceive them as fitting together coherently in the way specified by the ((174)) structure of the narrative. The issue of truth in this case is whether the coherence provided by the narrative matches the coherence you see in your life. And it is the coherence that you see in your life that gives it meaning and significance. Let us now ask what is involved in understanding as true the nonconventional metaphor \"Life's . . . a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" This non- conventional metaphor evokes the conventional metaphor LIFE IS A STORY. The most salient fact about stories told by idiots is that they are not coherent. They start off as if they were coherent stories with stages, causal connections, and overall purposes, but they suddenly shift over and over again, making it impossible to find coherence as you go along or any coherence overall. A life story of this sort would have no coherent structure for us and therefore no way of providing meaning or significance to our lives. There would be no way of highlighting events in your life as being significant, that is, as serving a purpose, having a causal connection to other significant events, fitting stages, etc. In a life viewed as a tale, episodes \"full of sound and fury\" would represent periods of frenzy, agonized struggle, and perhaps violence. In a typical life story, such events would be viewed as momentous—either traumatic, cathartic, disastrous, or climactic. But the modifier \"signifying nothing\" negates all these possibilities for significance, suggesting instead that the episodes cannot be viewed in terms of causal connections, purposes, or identifiable stages in some coherent whole. If we in fact view our lives and the lives of others in this way, then we would take the metaphor as being true. What makes it possible for many of us to see this metaphor as true is that we usually comprehend our life experiences in terms of the LIFE IS A STORY metaphor. We are constantly looking for meaning in our lives by seeking out coherences that will fit some sort of coherent life story. And we constantly tell such stories and live in terms of them. As the circumstances ((175)) of our lives change, we constantly revise our life stories, seeking new coherence. The metaphor LIFE'S . . . A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT may\nwell fit the lives of people whose life circumstances change so radically, rapidly, and unexpectedly that no coherent life story ever seems possible for them. Although we have seen that such new, nonconventional metaphors will fit our general account of truth, we should stress again that issues of truth are among the least relevant and interesting issues that arise in the study of metaphor. The real significance of the metaphor LIFE'S. . . A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT iS that, in getting us to try to understand how it could be true, it makes possible a new understanding of our lives. It highlights the fact that we are constantly functioning under the expectation of being able to fit our lives into some coherent life story but that this expectation may be constantly frustrated when the most salient experiences in our lives, those full of sound and fury, do not fit any coherent whole and, therefore, signify nothing. Normally, when we construct life stories, we leave out many extremely important experiences for the sake of finding co- herence. What the LIFE'S . . . A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT metaphor does is to evoke the LIFE IS A STORY metaphor, which involves living with the constant expectation of fitting important episodes into a coherent whole—a sane life story. The effect of the metaphor is to evoke this expectation and to point out that, in reality, it may be constantly frustrated. Understanding a Situation: A Summary In this chapter we have been developing the elements of an experiential account of truth. Our account of truth is based on understanding. What is central to this theory is our analysis of what it means to understand a situation. Here is a summary of what we have said on the matter so far: ((176)) Direct Immediate Understanding There are many things that we understand directly from our direct physical involvement as an inseparable part of our immediate environment. Entity structure: We understand ourselves as bounded entities, and we directly experience certain objects that we come into direct contact with as bounded entities, too. Orientational structure: We understand ourselves and other objects as having certain orientations relative to the environments we function in (up-down, in-out, front-back, on-off, etc.). Dimensions of experience: There are dimensions of experience in terms of which we function most of the time in our direct interactions with others and with our immediate physical and cultural environment. We categorize the entities we directly encounter and the direct experiences we have in terms of these categories. Experiential gestalts: Our object and substance categories are gestalts that have at least the following dimensions: perceptual, motor activity, part/whole, functional, purposive. Our categories of direct actions, activities, events, and experiences are gestalts that have at least the following dimensions: participants, parts, motor activities, perceptions, stages, linear sequences (of parts), causal relations, purpose (goals/plans for actions and end states for events). These constitute the natural dimensions of our direct experience. Not all of them will play a role in every kind of direct experience, but, in general, most of them will play some role or other. Background: An experiential gestalt will typically serve as a background for understanding something we experience as an aspect of that gestalt. Thus a person or object may be under-stood as a participant in a gestalt, and an action may be under-stood as a part of a gestalt. One gestalt may presuppose the presence of another, which may, in turn, presuppose the presence of others, and so on. The result will typically be an in-credibly rich background structure necessary for a full under-standing of any given situation. Most of this background\n((177)) structure will never be noticed, since it is presupposed in so many of our daily activities and experiences. Highlighting: Understanding a situation as being an instance of an experiential gestalt involves picking out elements of the situation as fitting the dimensions of the gestalt—for example, picking out aspects of the experience as being participants, parts, stages, etc. This highlights those aspects of the situation and downplays or hides aspects of the situation that do not fit the gestalt. Interactional properties: The properties we directly experience an object or event as having are products of our interactions with them in our environment. That is, they may not be inherent properties of the object or experience but, instead, interactional properties. Prototypes: Each category is structured in terms of a pro-totype, and something counts as a member of the category by virtue of the family resemblances it bears to the prototype. Indirect Understanding We have just described how we understand aspects of a situation that are fairly clearly delineated in our direct experience. But we have seen throughout this work that many aspects of our experience cannot be clearly delineated in terms of the naturally emergent dimensions of our experience. This is typically the case for human emotions, abstract concepts, mental activity, time, work, human in- stitutions, social practices, etc., and even for physical objects that have no inherent boundaries or orientations. Though most of these can be experienced directly, none of them can be fully comprehended on their own terms. In-stead, we must understand them in terms of other entities and experiences, typically other kinds of entities and experiences. As we saw, understanding a situation where we see the fog as being in front of the mountain requires us to view the fog and the mountain as entities. It also requires us to project a front-back orientation upon the mountain. These pro- ((178)) jections are built into our very perception. We perceive the fog and the mountain as entities and we perceive the mountain as having a front, with the fog in front of it. The front-back orientation that we perceive for the mountain is obviously an interactional property, as is the status of the fog and the mountain as entities. Here we have a case of indirect understanding, where we are understanding physical phenomena in terms of other more clearly delineated physical phenomena. What we do in indirect understanding is to use the re-sources of direct understanding. In the case of the fog and the mountain, we are using entity structure and orientational structure. In this case we stayed within a single do-main, that of physical objects. But most of our indirect understanding involves understanding one kind of entity or experience in terms of another kind—that is, understanding via metaphor. As we have seen, all of the resources that are used in direct, immediate\nunderstanding are pressed into service in indirect understanding via metaphor. Entity structure: Entity and substance structure is imposed via ontological metaphor. Orientational structure: Orientational structure is imposed via orientational metaphor. Dimensions of experience: Structural metaphor involves structuring one kind of thing or experience in terms of another kind, but the same natural dimensions of experience are used in both (e.g., parts, stages, purposes, etc.). Experiential gestalts: Structural metaphor involves imposing part of one gestalt structure upon another. Background: Experiential gestalts play the role of a back-ground in metaphorical understanding, just as they do in non-metaphorical understanding. Highlighting: Metaphorical highlighting works by the same mechanism as that for nonmetaphorical gestalts. That is, the experiential gestalt that is superimposed in the situation via the metaphor picks out elements of the situation as fitting its dimensions—it picks out its own participants, parts, stages, ((179)) etc. These are what the metaphor highlights, and what is not highlighted is downplayed or hidden. Since new metaphors highlight things not usually highlighted by our normal conceptual structure, they have become the most celebrated examples of highlighting. Interactional properties: All of the dimensions of our experience are interactional in nature, and all experiential gestalts involve interactional properties. This holds for both metaphorical and nonmetaphorical concepts. Prototypes: Both metaphorical and nonmetaphorical categories are structured in terms of prototypes. Truth Is Based on Understanding We have seen that the same eight aspects of our conceptual system that go into direct immediate understanding of situations play parallel roles in indirect understanding. These aspects of our normal conceptual system are used whether we are understanding a situation in metaphorical or non-metaphorical terms. It is because we understand situations in terms of our conceptual system that we can understand statements using that system of concepts as being true, that is, as fitting or not fitting the situation as we understand it. Truth is therefore a function of our conceptual system. It is because many of our concepts are metaphorical in nature, and because we understand situations in terms of those concepts, that metaphors can be true or false. The Nature of the Experientialist Account of Truth We understand a statement as being true in a given situation when our understanding of the statement fits our understanding of the situation closely\nenough ,for our purposes. This is the foundation of our experientialist theory of truth, which has the following characteristics. ((180)) First, our theory has some elements in common with a correspondence theory. According to the most rudimentary correspondence view, a statement has an objective mean-ing, which specifies the conditions under which it is true. Truth consists of a direct fit (or correspondence) between a statement and some state of affairs in the world. We reject such a simplistic picture, primarily because it ignores the way in which truth is based on understanding. The experientialist view we are proposing is a correspondence theory in the following sense: A theory of truth is a theory of what it means to understand a statement as true or false in a certain situation. Any correspondence between what we say and some state of affairs in the world is always mediated by our understanding of the statement and of the state of affairs. Of course, our under-standing of the situation results from our interaction with the situation itself. But we are able to make true (or false) statements about the world because it is possible for our under-standing of a statement to fit (or not fit) our understanding of the situation in which the statement is made. Since we understand situations and statements in terms of our conceptual system, truth for us is always relative to that conceptual system. Likewise, since an understanding is always partial, we have no access to \"the whole truth\" or to any definitive account of reality. Second, understanding something requires fitting it into a coherent scheme, relative to a conceptual system. Thus, truth will always depend partly on coherence. This gives us elements of a coherence theory. Third, understanding also requires a grounding in experience. On the experientialist view, our conceptual system emerges from our constant successful functioning in our physical and cultural environment. Our categories of experience and the dimensions out of which they are constructed not only have emerged from our experience but are constantly being tested through ongoing successful func- ((181)) tioning by all the members of our culture. This gives us elements of a pragmatic theory. Fourth, the experientialist theory of truth has some elements in common with classical realism, but\nthese do not include its insistence on absolute truth. Instead, it takes as given that: The physical world is what it is. Cultures are what they are. People are what they are. People successfully interact in their physical and cultural environments. They are constantly interacting with the real world. Human categorization is constrained by reality, since it is characterized in terms of natural dimensions of experience that are constantly tested through physical and cultural interaction. Classical realism focuses on physical reality rather than cultural and personal reality. But social, political, economic, and religious institutions and the human beings who function within them are no less real than trees, tables, or rocks. Since our account of truth deals with social and personal reality as well as physical reality, it can be considered an attempt to extend the realist tradition. The experientialist theory varies from classical objective realism in the following basic way: Human concepts do not correspond to inherent properties of things but only to interactional properties. This is natural, since concepts can be metaphorical in nature and can vary from culture to culture. Fifth, people with very different conceptual systems than our own may understand the world in a very different way than we do. Thus, they may have a very different body of truths than we have and even different criteria for truth and reality. It should be obvious from this description that there is nothing radically new in our account of truth. It includes some of the central insights of the phenomenological tradi-tion, such as the rejection of epistemological foundationalism, the stress on the centrality of the body in the structuring of our experience, and the importance of that ((182)) structure in understanding. Our view also accords with some of the key elements of Wittgenstein's later philosophy: the family-resemblance account of categorization, the rejection of the picture theory of meaning, the rejection of a building-block theory of meaning, and the emphasis on meaning as relative to context and to one's own conceptual system. Elements of Human Understanding in Theories of \"Objective Truth\" A theory of truth based on understanding is obviously not a theory of \"purely objective truth.\" We do not believe that there is such a thing as absolute truth, and we think that it is pointless to try to give a theory of it. However, it is traditional in Western philosophy to assume that absolute truth is possible and to undertake to give an account of it. We would like to point out how the most prominent contemporary approaches to the problem build in aspects of human understanding, which they claim to exclude. The most obvious case is the account of truth given within model-theoretic approaches, say, for example, those done within the Kripke and Montague traditions. The models are constructed out of a universe of discourse that is taken to be a set of entities. Relative to this set of entities, we can define world states, in which all the properties that the entities have and all the relations among them are specified. It is assumed that this concept of a world state is sufficiently general to apply to any conceivable situation, including the real world. In such a system, sentences like \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" would present no\nproblem, since there would be an entity corresponding to the fog, an entity corresponding to the mountain, and a relation in front of, relating the two entities. But such models do not correspond to the world in itself, free of human understanding, since there are in the world no well-defined entities corresponding to the mountain and the fog and ((183)) there is no inherent front to the mountain. The entity structure and the front-back orientation are imposed by virtue of human understanding. Any attempt to give an ac-count of the truth of \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" in such model-theoretic terms will not be an account of objective, absolute truth, since it involves building elements of human understanding into the models. The same can be said of attempts to provide a theory of truth meeting the constraints of the classic Tarski truth definition: \"S\" is true if and only if S or more up-to-date versions like: \"S\" is true if and only if p (where p is a statement in some universally applicable logical language) The prototype for such theories, the well-worn \"Snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white. seems reasonable enough, since there could reasonably be thought to be a sense in which snow is objectively identifiable and in which it is inherently white. But what about \"The fog is in front of the mountain\" is true if and only if the fog is in front of the mountain. Since the world does not contain clearly identifiable entities the fog and the mountain, and since mountains don't have inherent fronts, the theory can work only relative to some human understanding of what a front is for a mountain and to some delineation of.fog and mountain. The problem is even trickier, since not all human beings have the same way of projecting fronts onto mountains. Here some elements of human understanding must be brought in to make the truth definition work. There is another important difference between our ac-count of truth in terms of understanding and the standard attempts to give an account of truth free of human under- ((184))\nstanding. The different accounts of truth give rise to different accounts of meaning. For us, meaning depends on understanding. A sentence can't mean anything to you un-less you understand it. Moreover, meaning is always meaning to someone. There is no such thing as a meaning of a sentence in itself, independent of any people. When we speak of the meaning of a sentence, it is always the meaning of the sentence to someone, a real person or a hypothetical typical member of a speech community. Here our theory differs radically from standard theories of meaning. The standard theories assume that it is possible to give an account of truth in itself, free of human under- standing, and that the theory of meaning will be based on such a theory of truth. We see no possibility for any such program to work and think that the only answer is to base both the theory of meaning and the theory of truth on a theory of understanding. Metaphor, both conventional and nonconventional, plays a central role in such a program. Metaphors are basically devices for understanding and have little to do with objective reality, if there is such a thing. The fact that our conceptual system is inherently metaphorical, the fact that we understand the world, think, and function in metaphorical terms, and the fact that metaphors can not merely be understood but can be meaningful and true as well—these facts all suggest that an adequate account of meaning and truth can only be based on understanding. 25. The Myths of Objectivism and Subjectivism The Choices Our Culture Offers We have given an account of the way in which truth is based on understanding. We have argued that truth is always relative to a conceptual system, that any human conceptual system is mostly metaphorical in nature, and that, therefore, there is no fully objective, unconditional, or absolute truth. To many people raised in the culture of science or in other subcultures where absolute truth is taken for granted, this will be seen as a surrender to subjectivity and arbitrariness—to the Humpty-Dumpty notion that something means \"just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.\" For the same reason, those who identify with the Romantic tradition may see any victory over objectivism as a triumph of imagination over science—a triumph of the view that each individual makes his own reality, free of any constraints. Either of these views would be a misunderstanding based on the mistaken cultural\nassumption that the only alternative to objectivism is radical subjectivity—that is, either you believe in absolute truth or you can make the world in your own image. If you're not being objective, you're being subjective, and there is no third choice. We see ourselves as offering a third choice to the myths of objectivism and subjectivism. Incidentally, we are not using the term \"myth\" in any derogatory way. Myths provide ways of comprehending experience; they give order to our lives. Like metaphors, myths are necessary for making sense of what goes on ((186)) around us. All cultures have myths, and people cannot function without myth any more than they can function without metaphor. And just as we often take the metaphors of our own culture as truths, so we often take the myths of our own culture as truths. The myth of objectivism is particularly insidious in this way. Not only does it purport not to be a myth, but it makes both myths and metaphors objects of belittlement and scorn: according to the objectivist myth, myths and metaphors cannot be taken seriously be-cause they are not objectively true. As we will see, the myth of objectivism is itself not objectively true. But this does not make it something to be scorned or ridiculed. The myth of objectivism is part of the everyday functioning of every member of this culture. It needs to be examined and understood. We also think it needs to be supplemented—not by its opposite, the myth of subjectivism, but by a new experientialist myth, which we think better fits the realities of our experience. In order to get clear about what an experientialist alternative would be like, we first need to examine the myths of objectivism and subjectivism in detail. The Myth of Objectivism The myth of objectivism says that: 1.The world is made up of objects. They have properties independent of any people or other beings who experience them. For example, take a rock. It's a separate object and it's hard. Even if no people or other beings existed in the universe, it would still be a separate object and it would still be hard. 2.We get our knowledge of the world by experiencing the objects in it and getting to know what properties the objects have and how these objects are related to one another. For example, we find out that a rock is a separate object by looking at it, feeling it, moving it around, etc. We find out that it's hard by touching it, trying to squeeze it, kicking it, banging it against something softer, etc. ((187))\n3.We understand the objects in our world in terms of categories and concepts. These categories and concepts correspond to properties the objects have in themselves (inherently) and to the relationships among the objects. Thus, we have a word \"rock,\" which corresponds to a concept ROCK. Given a rock, we can tell that it is in the category ROCK and that a piano, a tree, or a tiger would not be. Rocks have inherent properties independent of any beings: they're solid, hard, dense, occur in nature, etc. We understand what a \"rock\" is in terms of these properties. 4.There is an objective reality, and we can say things that are objectively, absolutely, and unconditionally true and false about it. But, as human beings, we are subject to human error, that is, illusions, errors of perception, errors of judgment, emotions, and personal and cultural biases. We cannot rely upon the subjective judgments of individual people. Science provides us with a methodology that allows us to rise above our subjective limitations and to achieve understanding from a universally valid and unbiased point of view. Science can ultimately give a correct, definitive, and general account of reality, and, through its methodology, it is constantly progressing toward that goal. 5.Words have fixed meanings. That is, our language ex-presses the concepts and categories that we think in terms of. To describe reality correctly, we need words whose meanings are clear and precise, words that fit reality. These may be words that arise naturally, or they may be technical terms in a scientific theory. 6.People can be objective and can speak objectively, but they can do so only if they use language that is clearly and precisely defined, that is straightforward and direct, and that can fit reality. Only by speaking in this way can people communicate precisely about the external world and make statements that can be judged objectively to be true or false. 7.Metaphor and other kinds of poetic, fanciful, rhetorical, or figurative language can always be avoided in speak-ing objectively, and they should be avoided, since their ((188)) meanings are not clear and precise and do not fit reality in any obvious way. 8.Being objective is generally a good thing. Only objective knowledge is really knowledge. Only from an objective, unconditional point of view can we really understand ourselves, others, and the external world. Objectivity allows us to rise above personal prejudice and bias, to be fair, and to take an unbiased view of the world. 9.To be objective is to be rational; to be subjective is to be irrational and to give in to the emotions. 10.Subjectivity can be dangerous, since it can lead to losing touch with reality. Subjectivity can be unfair, since it takes a personal point of view and can, therefore, be biased. Subjectivity is self-indulgent, since it exaggerates the importance of the individual. The Myth of Subjectivism The myth of subjectivism says that:\n1.In most of our everyday practical activities we rely on our senses and develop intuitions we can trust. When important issues arise, regardless of what others may say, our own senses and intuitions are our best guides for action. 2.The most important things in our lives are our feelings, aesthetic sensibilities, moral practices, and spiritual awareness. These are purely subjective. None of these is purely rational or objective. 3.Art and poetry transcend rationality and objectivity and put us in touch with the more important reality of our feelings and intuitions. We gain this awareness through imagination rather than reason. 4.The language of the imagination, especially metaphor, is necessary for expressing the unique and most personally significant aspects of our experience. In matters of personal understanding the ordinary agreed-upon meanings that words have will not do. 5.Objectivity can be dangerous, because it misses what ((189)) is most important and meaningful to individual people. Objectivity can be unfair, since it must ignore the most rele-vant realms of our experience in favor of the abstract, universal, and impersonal. For the same reason, objectivity can be inhuman. There are no objective and rational means for getting at our feelings, our aesthetic sensibilities, etc. Science is of no use when it comes to the most important things in our lives. Fear of Metaphor Objectivism and subjectivism need each other in order to exist. Each defines itself in opposition to the other and sees the other as the enemy. Objectivism takes as its allies sci- entific truth, rationality, precision, fairness, and im-partiality. Subjectivism takes as its allies the emotions, intuitive insight, imagination, humaneness, art, and a \"higher\" truth. Each is master in its own realm and views its realm as the better of the two. They coexist, but in separate domains. Each of us has a realm in his life where it is appropriate to be objective and a realm where it is appropriate to be subjective. The portions of our lives governed by objectivism and subjectivism vary greatly from person to person and from culture to culture. Some of us even at-tempt to live our entire lives totally by one myth or the other. In Western culture as a whole, objectivism is by far the greater potentate, claiming to rule, at least nominally, the realms of science, law, government, journalism, morality, business, economics, and scholarship. But, as we have argued, objectivism is a myth. Since the time of the Greeks, there has been in Western culture a tension between truth, on the one hand, and art, on the other, with art viewed as illusion and allied, via its link with poetry and theater, to the tradition of persuasive public oratory. Plato viewed poetry and rhetoric with suspicion and banned poetry from his utopian Republic be-\n((190)) cause it gives no truth of its own, stirs up the emotions, and thereby blinds mankind to the real truth. Plato, typical of persuasive writers, stated his view that truth is absolute and art mere illusion by the use of a powerful rhetorical device, his Allegory of the Cave. To this day, his metaphors dominate Western philosophy, providing subtle and elegant ex-pression for his view that truth is absolute. Aristotle, on the other hand, saw poetry as having a positive value: \"It is a great thing, indeed, to make proper use of the poetic forms, ... But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor\" (Poetics 1459a); \"ordinary words convey only what we know already; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh\" (Rhetoric 1410b). But although Aristotle's theory of how metaphors work is the classic view, his praise of metaphor's ability to induce insight was never carried over into modern philosophical thought. With the rise of empirical science as a model for truth, the suspicion of poetry and rhetoric became dominant in Western thought, with metaphor and other figurative devices becoming objects of scorn once again. Hobbes, for example, finds metaphors absurd and misleadingly emotional; they are \"ignes fatui; and reasoning upon them is wandering amongst innumerable absurdities; and their end, contention and sedition, or contempt\" (Leviathan, pt. 1, chap. 5). Hobbes finds absurdity in \"the use of metaphors, tropes, and other rhetorical figures, instead of words proper. For though it be lawful to say, for example in common speech, the way goeth, or leadeth hither, or thither; the proverb says this or that, whereas ways cannot go, nor proverbs speak; yet in reckoning, and seeking of truth, such speeches are not to be admitted\" (ibid.). Locke, continuing the empiricist tradition, shows the same contempt for figurative speech, which he views as a tool of rhetoric and an enemy of truth: ... if we would speak of things as they are, we must allow that all the art of rhetoric, besides order and clearness; all the artifi- ((191)) cial and figurative application of words eloquence hath in-vented, are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas, move the passions, and thereby mislead the judgment; and so indeed are perfect cheats: and therefore, however laudable or allow-able oratory may render them in harangues and popular ad-dresses, they are certainly, in all discourses that pretend to inform or instruct, wholly to be avoided; and where truth and knowledge are concerned, cannot but be thought a great fault, either of the language or person that makes use of them.... It is evident how much men love to deceive and be deceived, since rhetoric, that powerful instrument of error and deceit, has its established professors, is publicly taught, and has always been had in great reputation. [Essay Concerning Human Understanding, bk. 3, chap. 10] The fear of metaphor and rhetoric in the empiricist tradi-tion is a fear of subjectivism—a fear of emotion and the imagination. Words are viewed as having \"proper senses\" in terms of which truths can be expressed. To use words metaphorically is to use them in an improper sense, to stir the imagination and thereby the emotions and thus to lead us away from the truth and toward illusion. The empiricist distrust and fear of metaphor is wonderfully summed up by Samuel Parker: All those Theories in Philosophy which are expressed only in metaphorical Termes, are not real Truths, but the meer products of Imagination, dress'd up (like Childrens babies) in a few spangled empty words.... Thus their wanton and luxuriant fancies climbing up into the Bed of Reason, do not only defile it by unchaste and illegitimate Embraces, but instead of real conceptions and notices of\nThings, impregnate the mind with nothing but Ayerie and Subventaneous Phantasmes. [Free and Impartial Censure of the Platonick Philosophy (1666)] As science became more powerful via technology and the Industrial Revolution became a dehumanizing reality, there occurred a reaction among poets, artists, and occasional philosophers: the development of the Romantic tradition. Wordsworth and Coleridge gladly left reason, science, and ((192)) objectivity to the dehumanized empiricists and exalted imagination as a more humane means of achieving a higher truth, with emotion as a natural guide to self-understanding. Science, reason, and technology had alienated man from himself and his natural environment, or so the Romantics alleged; they saw poetry, art, and a return to nature as a way for man to recover his lost humanity. Art and poetry were seen, not as products of reason, but as the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.\" The result of this Romantic view was the alienation of the artist and poet from mainstream society. The Romantic tradition, by embracing subjectivism, reinforced the dichotomy between truth and reason, on the one hand, and art and imagination, on the other. By giving up on rationality, the Romantics played into the hands of the myth of objectivism, whose power has continued to increase ever since. The Romantics did, however, create a domain for themselves, where subjectivism continues to hold sway. It is an impoverished domain compared to that of objectivism. In terms of real power in our society—in science, law, government, business, and the media—the myth of objectivism reigns supreme. Subjectivism has carved out a domain for itself in art and perhaps in religion. Most people in this culture see it as an appendage to the realm of objectivism and a retreat for the emotions and the imagination. The Third Choice: An Experientialist Synthesis What we are offering in the experientialist account of understanding and truth is an alternative which denies that subjectivity and objectivity are our only choices. We reject the objectivist view that there is absolute and unconditional truth without adopting the subjectivist alternative of truth as obtainable only through the imagination, unconstrained by external circumstances. The reason we have focused so ((193)) much on metaphor is that it unites reason and imagination. Reason, at the very least,\ninvolves categorization, entail-ment, and inference. Imagination, in one of its many aspects, involves seeing one kind of thing in terms of another kind of thing—what we have called metaphorical thought. Metaphor is thus imaginative rationality. Since the categories of our everyday thought are largely metaphorical and our everyday reasoning involves metaphorical entailments and inferences, ordinary rationality is therefore imaginative by its very nature. Given our understanding of poetic metaphor in terms of metaphorical entailments and inferences, we can see that the products of the poetic imagination are, for the same reason, partially rational in nature. Metaphor is one of our most important tools for trying to comprehend partially what cannot be comprehended to-tally: our feelings, aesthetic experiences, moral practices, and spiritual awareness. These endeavors of the imagination are not devoid of rationality; since they use metaphor, they employ an imaginative rationality. An experientialist approach also allows us to bridge the gap between the objectivist and subjectivist myths about impartiality and the possibility of being fair and objective. The two choices offered by the myths are absolute objectivity, on the one hand, and purely subjective intuition, on the other. We have seen that truth is relative to under-standing, which means that there is no absolute standpoint from which to obtain absolute objective truths about the world. This does not mean that there are no truths; it means only that truth is relative to our conceptual system, which is grounded in, and constantly tested by, our experiences and those of other members of our culture in our daily inter-actions with other people and with our physical and cultural environments. Though there is no absolute objectivity, there can be a kind of objectivity relative to the conceptual system of a culture. The point of impartiality and fairness in social ((194)) matters is to rise above relevant individual biases. The point of objectivity in scientific experimentation is to factor out the effects of individual illusion and error. This is not to say that we can always, or even ever, be completely successful in factoring out individual biases to achieve complete objectivity relative to a conceptual system and a cultural set of values. It is only to say that pure subjective intuition is not always our only recourse. Nor is this to say that the concepts and values of a particular culture constitute the final arbiter of fairness within the culture. There may be, and typically are, transcultural concepts and values that define a standard of fairness very different from that of a particular culture. What was fair in Nazi Germany, for example, was not fair in the eyes of the world community. Closer to home, there are court cases that constantly in-volve issues of fairness across subcultures with conflicting values. Here the majority culture usually gets to define fairness relative to its values, but these mainstream cultural values change over time and are often subject to criticism by other cultures. What the myths of objectivism and subjectivism both miss is the way we understand the world through our inter-actions with it. What objectivism misses is the fact that understanding, and therefore truth, is necessarily relative to our cultural conceptual systems and that it cannot be framed in any absolute or neutral conceptual system. Ob- jectivism also misses the fact that human conceptual systems are metaphorical in nature and involve an imaginative understanding of one kind of thing in terms of another. What subjectivism specifically misses is that our under-standing, even our most imaginative understanding, is given in terms of a conceptual system that is grounded in our successful\nfunctioning in our physical and cultural environments. It also misses the fact that metaphorical under-standing involves metaphorical entailment, which is an imaginative form of rationality. ((195)) 26. The Myth of Objectivism in Western Philosophy and Linguistics Our Challenge to the Myth of Objectivism The myth of objectivism has dominated Western culture, and in particular Western philosophy, from the Presocratics to the present day. The view that we have access to absolute and unconditional truths about the world is the cornerstone of the Western philosophical tradition. The myth of objectivity has flourished in both the rationalist and empiricist traditions, which in this respect differ only in their accounts of how we arrive at such absolute truths. For the rationalists, only our innate capacity to reason can give us knowledge of things as they really are. For the empiricists, all our knowledge of the world arises from our sense perceptions (either directly or indirectly) and is constructed out of the elements of sensation. Kant's synthesis of rationalism and empiricism falls within the objectivist tradition also, despite his claim that there can be no knowledge whatever of things as they are in themselves. What makes Kant an objectivist is his claim that, relative to the kinds of things that all human beings can experience through their senses (his empiricist legacy), we can have universally valid knowledge and universally valid moral laws by the use of our universal reason (his rationalist legacy). The objectivist tradition in Western philosophy is preserved to this day in the descendants of the logical positivists, the Fregean tradition, the tradition of Husserl, and, in linguistics, in the neorationalism that came out of the Chomsky tradition. Our account of metaphor goes against this tradition. We\n((196)) see metaphor as essential to human understanding and as a mechanism for creating new meaning and new realities in our lives. This puts us at odds with most of the Western philosophical tradition, which has seen metaphor as an agent of subjectivism and, therefore, as subversive of the quest for absolute truth. In addition, our views on con- ventional metaphor—that it pervades our conceptual system and is a primary mechanism for understanding—put us at odds with the contemporary views of language, mean-ing, truth, and understanding that dominate recent Anglo-American analytic philosophy and go unquestioned in much of modern linguistics and other disciplines as well. The following is a representative list of these assumptions about language, meaning, truth, and understanding. Not all objectivist philosophers and linguists accept all of them, but the most influential figures seem to accept most of them. Truth is a matter of fitting words to the world. A theory of meaning for natural language is based on a theory of truth, independent of the way people understand and use language. Meaning is objective and disembodied, independent of human understanding. Sentences are abstract objects with inherent structures. The meaning of a sentence can be obtained from the meanings of its parts and the structure of the sentence. Communication is a matter of a speaker's transmitting a message with a fixed meaning to a hearer. How a person understands a sentence, and what it means to him, is a function of the objective meaning of the sentence and what the person believes about the world and about the con-text in which the sentence is uttered. Our account of conventional metaphor is inconsistent with all of these assumptions. The meaning of a sentence is given in terms of a conceptual structure. As we have seen, most of the conceptual structure of a natural Ian- ((197)) guage is metaphorical in nature. The conceptual structure is grounded in physical and cultural experience, as are the conventional metaphors. Meaning, therefore, is never dis- embodied or objective and is always grounded in the acquisition and use of a conceptual system. Moreover, truth is always given relative to a conceptual system and the metaphors that structure it. Truth is therefore not absolute or objective but is based on understanding. Thus sentences do not have inherent, objectively given meanings, and communication cannot be merely the transmission of such meanings.\nIt is not at all obvious why our account of these matters is so different from the standard philosophical and linguistic positions. The basic reason seems to be that all of the standard positions are based on the myth of objectivism, while our account of metaphor is inconsistent with it. Such a radical divergence from the dominant theories of such basic matters calls for explanation. How could it be possible for an account of metaphor to call into question the fundamental assumptions about truth, meaning, and understanding that have emerged from the dominant trends in the Western philosophical tradition? An answer to this requires a far more detailed account of the objectivist assumptions about language, truth, and meaning than we have given so far. It requires stating in more detail (a) what the objectivist assumptions are, (h) how they are motivated, and (c) what their implications are for a general account of language, truth, and meaning. The point of this analysis is not merely to distinguish our views on language from the standard views but to show by example how influential the myth of objectivism is in Western culture in ways that we usually don't notice. More importantly, we want to suggest that many of the problem areas for our culture may come from a blind acceptance of the myth of objectivism and that there is another alternative short of recourse to radical subjectivity. ((198)) How Standard Theories of Meaning Are Rooted in the Myth of Objectivism The myth of objectivism, which is the basis of the objectivist tradition, has very specific consequences for a theory of meaning. We would like to show just what these consequences are, how they arise from the myth of objectivism, and why they are untenable from an experientialist point of view. Not all objectivists hold all of the following positions, but it is common for objectivists to hold most of them in some form or other. Meaning Is Objective The objectivist characterizes meaning purely in terms of conditions of objective truth or falsity. On the objectivist view, the conventions of the language assign to each sentence an objective meaning, which determines objective truth conditions, given certain elements of context called \"indexicals\": who the speaker is, who his audience is, the time and place of the utterance, the objects referred to by words like \"that,\" \"this,\" etc. Thus, the objective meaning of a sentence does not depend on the way any given person happens to understand it or on whether he understands it at all. For example, a parrot might be trained to say \"It's raining\" without any understanding at all of the meaning of this in English. But the sentence has the same objective meaning whether it is said by a parrot or a person, and it will be true if it happens to be raining and false if it isn't raining. Given the objectivist account of meaning, a person understands the objective meaning of a sentence if he understands the conditions under which it would be true or false. The objectivist assumes not only that conditions of objective truth and falsity exist but that people have access to them. This is taken as being obvious. Look around you. If there is a pencil on the floor, then the sentence \"There is a pencil on the floor\" is true, and, if you speak English and ((199)) can perceive the pencil on the floor, you will correctly take it as being true. It is assumed that such sentences are objectively true or false and that you have access to innumerable such truths. Since people can understand the conditions under which a sentence can be objectively true, it is possible for a language to have conventions by which such objective\nmeanings are assigned to sentences. Thus, on the objectivist view, the conventions that a language has for pairing sentences with objective meanings will depend upon speakers of the language being able to understand the sentence as having that objective meaning. Thus, when the objectivist speaks of understanding the (literal) meaning of a sentence, he is speaking of understanding what makes a sentence objectively true or false. In general, the objectivist notion of understanding is limited to understanding conditions of truth or falsity. This is not what we have meant by \"understanding.\" When we say that the objectivist views meaning as being independent of understanding, we are taking \"understand-ing\" in our sense and not his. Meaning Is Disembodied In the objectivist view, objective meaning is not meaning to anyone. Expressions in a natural language can be said to have objective meaning only if that meaning is independent of anything human beings do, either in speaking or in act-ing. That is, meaning must be disembodied. Frege, for example, distinguishes the \"sense\" (Sinn), the objective meaning for a sign, from the \"idea,\" which arises from memories and sense impressions that I have had and acts, both internal and external, which I have performed.... The idea is subjective .... In the light of this, one need have no scruples in speaking simply of the sense, whereas in the case of an idea one must, strictly speaking, add to whom it belongs and at what time. [Frege, 1966, pp. 59—60] Frege's \"sense\" is objective disembodied meaning. Each ((200)) linguistic expression in a language has a disembodied meaning associated with it. This is reminiscent of the CONDUIT metaphor, where \"The meaning is right there in the words.\" The Fregean tradition continues to this day in the work of the disciples of Richard Montague and many others as well. In none of this work on semantics is the meaning of the sentence taken to depend in any way on the way a human being would understand it. As Montague puts it, \"Like Donald Davidson, I regard the construction of a theory of truth—or rather, of the more general notion of truth under an arbitrary interpretation—as the basic goal of a serious syntax and semantics\" (1974, p. 188). The important words here are \"arbitrary interpretation.\" Montague assumed that theories of meaning and truth are purely mathematical enterprises, and his goal was to maintain an \"arbitrary interpretation,\" untainted by anything at all having to do with human beings, especially matters of human psychol-ogy or human understanding. He intended his work to be applicable to any kind of being at all in the universe and to be free of any limitation imposed by any particular kind of being. Fitting the Words to the World without People or Human Understanding The objectivist tradition views semantics as the study of how linguistic expressions can fit the world directly, with-out the intervention of human understanding. Perhaps the clearest statement of this position is given by David Lewis: My proposals will also not conform to the expectations of those who, in analyzing meaning, turn immediately to the psychology and sociology of language users: to\nintentions, sense-experience, and mental ideas, or to social rules, conventions, and regularities. I distinguish two topics: first, the description of possible languages or grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are associated with aspects of the world; and second, the description of the psychological and ((201)) sociological facts whereby a particular one of these abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or po Only confusion comes of mixing these two topics. [Lewis 1972, p. 170] Here Lewis follows the practice of Montague in trying to give an account of how language can fit the world—\"how symbols are associated with aspects of the world\"—that is sufficiently general and sufficiently arbitrary that it could fit any conceivable psychological or sociological facts about how people use language and how they understand it. A Theory of Meaning Is Based on a Theory of Truth The possibility of an account of objective truth, in-dependent of any human understanding, makes a theory of objective meaning possible. Under the objectivist account of truth, it is possible for a sentence by itself to fit the world or not. If it does, it is true; if not, it is false. This gives rise directly to an objectivist account of meaning as based on truth. Again, David Lewis puts it most clearly: \"A meaning for a sentence is something that determines the conditions under which the sentence is true or false\" (1972, p. 173). This has been generalized to give meanings for performative sentences, like orders and promises, by the technique in Lakoff (1972) and Lewis (1972). The technique uses the definition of truth in terms of \"fitting the world, \" which is technically defined by conditions of satisfaction in a model. Felicity conditions of speech acts are similarly defined in terms of conditions of satisfaction, or \"fitting the world.\" When we speak of \"truth\" and \"falsity\" below, it should be understood that we are speaking in terms of conditions of satisfaction and that we are including speech acts as well as statements. Meaning Is Independent of Use The objectivist account of truth requires that meaning, too, be objective. If meaning is to be objective, it must exclude ((202)) all subjective elements—that is, anything peculiar to a particular context, culture, or mode of understanding. As Donald Davidson puts it: \"Literal meaning and truth conditions can be assigned to words and sentences apart from particular contexts of use\" (1978, p. 33). Meaning Is Compositional—The Building-Block Theory According to the myth of objectivism, the world is made up of objects; they have well- defined inherent properties, in-dependent of any being who experiences them, and there are fixed relations holding among them at any given point in time. These aspects of the myth of objectivism give rise to a building-block theory of meaning. If the world is made up of well- defined objects, we can give them names in a language. If the objects have well-defined inherent properties, we can have a language with one-place predicates corresponding to each of those properties. And if the objects stand in fixed relations to one another (at least\nat any given instant), we can have a language with many-place predicates corresponding to each relation. Assuming that the world is this way and that we have such a language, we can, using the syntax of this language, construct sentences that can correspond directly to any situation in the world. The meaning of the whole sentence will be its truth conditions, that is, the conditions under which the sentence can be fitted to some situation. The meaning of the whole sentence will depend entirely on the meanings of its parts and how they fit together. The meanings of the parts will specify what names can pick out what objects and what predicates can pick out what properties and relations. Objectivist theories of meaning are all compositional in nature—that is, they are all building-block theories—and they have to be. The reason is that, for the objectivist, the world is made up of building blocks: definable objects and clearly delineated inherent properties and relations. ((203)) Moreover, every sentence of the language must contain all of the necessary building blocks so that, together with the syntax, nothing more is needed to provide the truth conditions of the sentence. The \"something more\" that is ruled out is any kind of human understanding. Objectivism Permits Ontological Relativity without Human Understanding The logical positivists (e.g., Carnap) attempted to carry out an objectivist program by trying to construct a universally applicable formal (logical) language that had all of the building- block properties mentioned above and all of the other characteristics we have discussed so far. Richard Montague (1974) claimed to have provided a \"universal grammar\" that would map natural languages onto such a universally applicable formal language. Quine, reacting to such universalist claims, argued that each language has its own ontology built into it, and what counts as an object, property, or relation may vary from language to language. This position is known as the \"ontological relativity\" thesis. It is possible to maintain an ontological relativity thesis within the confines of the objectivist program without any recourse to human understanding or cultural difference. Such a relativistic position gives up on the possibility of constructing a single universally applicable logical language into which all natural languages can be translated adequately. It claims instead that each natural language carves up what is in the world in different ways—always picking out objects that are really there and properties and relations that are really there. But since different languages may have different ontologies built in, there is no guarantee that any two languages will, in general, be commensurable. The relativistic version of the objectivist account of meaning thus claims that meaning and truth conditions are objectively given, not in universal terms, but only relative to a given language. This relativistic objectivism still holds\n((204)) to the myth of objectivism in claiming that truth is objective and that there are objects in the world with inherent properties. But, according to relativistic objectivism, truths expressible in one language may not be translatable into another, since each language may carve up the world in different ways. But whatever entities the language picks out exist in the world objectively as entities. Truth and meaning are still objective in this account (though relative to a given language), and human understanding is still ruled out as irrelevant to meaning and truth. Linguistic Expressions Are Objects: The Premise of Objectivist Linguistics According to the myth of objectivism, objects have properties in and of themselves and they stand in relationships to one another independently of any being who understands them. When words and sentences are written down, they can he readily looked upon as objects. This has been the premise of objectivist linguistics from its origins in antiquity to the present: Linguistic expressions are objects that have properties in and of themselves and stand in fixed relationships to one another, independently of any person who speaks them or understands them. As objects, they have parts—they are made up of building blocks: words are made up of roots, prefixes, suffixes, infixes; sentences are made up of words and phrases; discourses are made up of sentences. Within a language, the parts can stand in various relationships to one another, depending upon their building-block structure and their inherent properties. The study of the building-block structure, the inherent properties of the parts, and the relationships among them has traditionally been called grcunnuur. Objectivist linguistics sees itself as the only scientific approach to linguistics. The objects must be capable of being analyzed in and of themselves, independently of contexts or the way people understand them. As in objectivist philosophy, there are both empiricist and rationalist traditions in ((205)) linguistics. The empiricist tradition, represented by the latter-day American structuralism of Bloomfield, Harris, and their followers, took texts as the only objects of scientific study. The rationalist tradition, represented by European structuralists such as Jakobson and American figures like Sapir, Whorf, and Chomsky, viewed language as having mental reality, with linguistic expressions as mentally real objects. Grammar Is Independent of Meaning and Understanding We have just seen how the myth of objectivism gives rise to a view of language in which linguistic expressions are objects with inherent properties, a building-block structure, and fixed relationships among the objects. According to the myth of objectivism, the linguistic objects that exist—and their building-block structure, their properties, and their relations—\nare independent of the way people understand them. It follows from this view of linguistic expressions as objects that grammar can be studied independently of meaning or human understanding. This tradition is epitomized by the linguistics of Noam Chomsky, who has steadfastly maintained that grammar is a matter of pure form, independent of meaning or human understanding. Any aspect of language that involves human understanding is for Chomsky by definition outside the study of grammar in this sense. Chomsky's use of the term \"competence\" as opposed to \"performance\" is an attempt to define certain aspects of language as the only legitimate objects of what he considers scientific linguistics—that is, what we have called objectivist linguistics in the rationalist mode, including only matters of pure form and excluding all matters of human understanding and language use. Though Chomsky sees linguistics as a branch of psychology, it is for him an independent branch, one that is in no way dependent on the way people actually understand language. ((206)) The Objectivist Theory of Communication: A Version of the CONDUIT Metaphor Within objectivist linguistics and philosophy, meanings and linguistic expressions are independently existing objects. Such a view gives rise to a theory of communication that fits the CONDUIT metaphor very closely: Meanings are objects. Linguistic expressions are objects. Linguistic expressions have meanings (in them). In communication, a speaker sends a fixed meaning to a hearer via the linguistic expression associated with that meaning. On this account it is possible to objectively say what you mean, and communication failures are matters of subjective errors: since the meanings are objectively right there in the words, either you didn't use the right words to say what you meant or you were misunderstood. What an Objectivist Account of Understanding Would Be Like We have already given an account of what the objectivist means by understanding the literal objective meaning of a sentence, namely, understanding the conditions under which a sentence would be objectively true or false. Objectivists recognize, however, that a person may understand a sentence in a given context as meaning something other than its literal objective meaning. This other meaning is usually called the \"speaker's meaning\" or the \"utterer's meaning,\" and objectivists typically recognize that any full account of understanding will have to account for these cases, too (see Grice 1957). Take, for example, the sentence \"He's a real genius,\" uttered in a context where sarcasm is clearly indicated. On the objectivist account, there is an objective meaning of the sentence \"He's a real genius,\" namely, that he has great intellectual powers. But in uttering the sentence sarcastically, the speaker intends to convey the opposite meaning, ((207)) namely, that he's an utter idiot. The speaker's meaning here is the opposite of the objective\nmeaning of the sentence. This account of speaker's meaning could be represented, in the appropriate sarcastic context, as follows: (A) In uttering a sentence S (S = \"He's a real genius\"), which has the objective meaning M (M = he has great intellectual powers), the speaker intends to convey to the hearer ob- jective meaning M' (M' = he's a real idiot). This is how meaning to someone might be accounted for in an objectivist framework. Sentence (A) is something that could be objectively true or false in a given context. If (A) is true, then the sentence S (\"He's a real genius\") can mean he's a real idiot to both the speaker and the hearer if the hearer recognizes the speaker's intentions. This technique, which originated with the speech-act theorists, has been adapted to the objectivist tradition as a way of getting meaning to someone out of the objective meaning of the sentence, that is, out of its conditions for objective truth or falsity. The technical trick here involves using two objective meanings, M and M', together with sentence (A), which also has an objective meaning, in such a way as to get an account of speaker's meaning and hearer's meaning, that is, meaning to someone. This, of course, involves recognizing a speaker's intentions as being objectively real, which some objectivists might deny. The example we have given is one of sarcasm, where M and M' have opposite meanings, that is, opposite truth conditions. Speaking literally would be a case where M = M'. The objectivist program sees this as a general technique for accounting for all cases of meaning to a person, especially where a speaker says one thing and means something else: exaggeration, understatement, hints, irony, and all figurative language—in particular, metaphor. Carrying out the program would involve formulating general principles that would answer the following question: ((208)) Given sentence S and its literal objective meaning M, and given the relevant knowledge of the context, what specific principles allow us to predict what the speaker's meaning M' will be in this context? In particular, this applies in the case of metaphor. For example, \"This theory is made of cheap stucco\" would, on the objectivist account, have a literal objective meaning (M) which is false, namely, this theory is made of inexpensive mortar. The literal objective meaning is false because theories are not the kind of thing that can be made up of mortar at all. However, \"This theory is made of cheap stucco\" could have an intended speaker's meaning (M') which might be true, namely, this theory is weak. In this case, the problem would be to give general principles of interpretation by which a hearer could move from the sentence S (\"This theory is made of cheap stucco\") to the intended speaker's meaning M (this theory is weak) via the objective meaning M (this theory is made of inexpensive mortar). The objectivist sees all metaphors as cases of indirect meaning, where M ~ M'. All sentences containing metaphors have objective meanings that are, in the typical case, either blatantly false (e.g., \"The theory is made of cheap stucco\") or blatantly true (e.g., \"Mussolini was an animal\"). Understanding a sentence (e.g., \"The theory is made of cheap stucco\") as metaphorical always involves understanding it indirectly as conveying an objective meaning M' (the theory is weak) which is different from the literal objective meaning M (the theory is made of in-expensive mortar). The objectivist account of understanding is thus always based on its account of objective truth. It includes two kinds of understanding, direct and indirect. Direct under-standing is understanding a literal objective meaning of a sentence in terms of the conditions under which it can be objectively true. Indirect understanding involves figuring\n((209)) out when the speaker is using one sentence to convey an indirect meaning, where the conveyed meaning can be understood directly in terms of objective truth conditions. There are four automatic consequences of the objectivist account of metaphor: By definition, there can he no such thing as a metaphorical concept or metaphorical meaning. Meanings are objective and specify conditions of objective truth. They are by definition ways of characterizing the world as it is or might be. Conditions of objective truth simply do not provide ways of viewing one thing in terms of another. Hence, objective meanings cannot be metaphorical. Since metaphor cannot he a matter of meaning, it can only he a matter of language. A metaphor, on the objectivist view, can at best give us an indirect way of talking about some objective meaning M' by using the language that would be used literally to talk about some other objective meaning M, which is usually false in a blatant way. Again by definition, there can he no such thing as literal (conventional) metaphor. A sentence is used literally when M' = M, that is, when the speaker's meaning is the objective meaning. Metaphors can only arise when M' ~ M. Thus, according to the objectivist definition, a literal metaphor is a contradiction in terms, and literal language cannot be metaphorical. Metaphor can contribute to understanding only by making us see objective similarities, that is, similarities between the objective meanings M and M'. These similarities must be based on shared inherent properties of objects—properties that the objects really have, in and of themselves. Thus, the objectivist account of meaning is completely at odds with everything we have claimed in this book. This view of meaning and of metaphor has been with us since the time of the Greeks. It fits the CONDUIT metaphor (\"The meaning is right there in the words\") and it fits the myth of objectivism. ((210)) 27. How Metaphor Reveals the Limitations of the Myth of Objectivism The heart of the objectivist tradition in philosophy comes directly out of the myth of objectivism: the world is made up of distinct objects, with inherent properties and fixed relations among them at any instant. We argue, on the basis of linguistic evidence (especially metaphor), that the objectivist philosophy fails to account for the way we understand our experience, our thoughts, and our language. An adequate account, we argue, requires —viewing objects only as entities relative to our interactions with the world and our projections on it —viewing properties as interactional rather than inherent —viewing categories as experiential gestalts defined via pro-totype instead of viewing them as rigidly fixed and defined via set theory We view issues having to do with meaning in natural language and with the way people\nunderstand both their language and their experiences as empirical issues rather than matters of a priori philosophical assumptions and argumentation. We have selected metaphor and the way we understand it from among the possible domains of evidence that could bear on these issues. We have focused on metaphor for the following four reasons: In the objectivist tradition, metaphor is of marginal inter-est at best, and it is excluded altogether from the study of semantics (objective meaning). It is seen as only marginally relevant to an account of truth. Yet we have found that metaphor is pervasive, not ((211)) merely in our language but in our conceptual system. It seems inconceivable to us that any phenomenon so fundamental to our conceptual system could not be central to an account of truth and meaning. We observed that metaphor is one of the most basic mechanisms we have for understanding our experience. This did not jibe with the objectivist view that metaphor is of only peripheral interest in an account of meaning and truth and that it plays at best a marginal role in understanding. We found that metaphor could create new meaning, create similarities, and thereby define a new reality. Such a view has no place in the standard objectivist picture of the world. The Objectivist Account of Conventional Metaphor Many of the facts that we have discussed have long been known in the objectivist tradition, but they have been given an entirely different interpretation from ours. The conventional metaphorical concepts we take as structuring our everyday conceptual system are taken by the objectivists to be nonexistent. Metaphors, for them, are matters of mere language; there are no such things as metaphorical concepts. Words and expressions that we have taken as instances of metaphorical concepts (e.g., digest in \"I can't digest all those facts\") would be taken by objectivists as not being instances of live metaphor at all. For them the word digest would have two different and distinct literal (objective) meanings—digest s for food and digest2 for ideas. On this account, there would be two words digest which are homonyms, like the two words bank (bank of a river and hank where you put your money). An objectivist might grant that digest an idea was once a metaphor, but he would claim that it is no longer metaphorical. For him it is a \"dead metaphor,\" one that ((212)) has become conventionalized and has its own literal mean-ing. This is to say that there are two homonymous words digest.\nThe objectivist would probably grant that digest and digest2 have similar meanings and that the similarity is the basis for the original metaphor. This, he would say, ex-plains why the same word is used to express two different meanings; it was once a metaphor, it became a conventionalized part of the language; it died and became frozen, taking its old metaphorical meaning as a new literal meaning. The objectivist would observe that the similarities upon which the dead metaphor was based can in many cases still be perceived today. According to the objectivist account of metaphor, the original metaphor was a matter of use and speaker's mean-ing, not literal objective meaning. It would have to have arisen by the general speaker's meaning formula applied to this case (where digest referred only to food): In uttering a sentence S (S = \"I couldn't digest his ideas\") with literal objective meaning M (M = I couldn't transform his ideas, by chemical and muscular action in the alimentary canal, into a form my body could absorb), the speaker intends to convey to the hearer the speaker's meaning M' (M' = I couldn't transform his ideas, by mental action, into a form my mind could absorb). Two things have to be true in order for this objectivist account to hold. First, the intended speaker's meaning M', referring to ideas, must be an objectively given meaning, having objective truth conditions. In other words, the following must be objectively true of the mind and ideas by virtue of their inherent properties: Ideas must, by virtue of their inherent properties, be the kind of thing that can have a form, be transformed, and be absorbed into the mind. The mind must, by virtue of its inherent properties, be the kind ((213)) of thing that can perform mental actions, transform ideas, and absorb them into itself. Second, the metaphor must have been originally based on preexisting similarities between M and M'. That is, the mind and the alimentary canal must have inherent properties in common, just as ideas and food must have inherent properties in common. To summarize: the dead-metaphor account of digest would claim the following: The word digest originally referred to a food concept. By a \"live\" metaphor, the word digest was transferred to a preexisting objective meaning in the realm of ideas, on the basis of preexisting objective similarities between food and ideas. Eventually the metaphor \"died,\" and the metaphorical use of digest an idea became conventional. Digest thus obtained a second literal objective meaning, the one occurring in M'. This is seen, on the objectivist account, as a typical way of providing words for preexisting meanings that lack words to express them. All such cases would be considered homonyms. In general, an objectivist would have to treat all of our conventional-metaphor data according to either the homonymy position (typically the weak version) or the abstraction position. Both of these positions depend on the existence of preexisting similarities based on\ninherent properties. What's Wrong with the Objectivist Account As we have just seen, the objectivist account of conventional metaphor requires either an abstraction view or a homonymy view. Moreover, the objectivist account of both conventional and nonconventional metaphor is based on preexisting inherent similarities. We have already presented detailed arguments against all of these positions. These arguments take on a special importance now. They show not only that the objectivist view of metaphor is in- ((214)) adequate but that the entire objectivist program is based on erroneous assumptions. To see just where the objectivist account of metaphor is inadequate, let us recall the relevant parts of our arguments against the abstraction, homonymy, and similarity views as they pertain to the objectivist ac-count of conventional metaphor. The Similarity Position We saw in our discussion of the IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor that, although the metaphor was based on similarities, the similarities themselves were not inherent but were based on other metaphors—in particular, THE MIND IS A CONTAINER, IDEAS ARE OBJECTS, and the CONDUIT metaphors. The view that IDEAS ARE OBJECTS is a projection of entity status upon mental phenomena via an ontological metaphor. The view that THE MIND IS A CONTAINER 1S a projection of entity status with in-out orientation onto our cognitive faculty. These are not inherent objective properties of ideas and of the mind. They are interactional properties, and they reflect the way in which we conceive of mental phenomena by virtue of metaphor. The same holds in the case of our concepts TIME and LOVE. We understand sentences like \"The time for action has arrived\" and \"We need to budget our time\" in terms of the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT and TIME IS MONEY metaphors, respectively. But on the objectivist account there would be no such metaphors. Arrive and budget in these sentences would be dead metaphors, that is, homonyms, deriving historically from once-live metaphors. These once-live metaphors would have to have been based on inherent similarities between time and moving objects, on the one hand, and time and money, on the other. But, as we have seen, such similarities are not inherent; they are themselves created via ontological metaphors. It is even more difficult to make a case for an inherent-similarity analysis for expressions involving the concept LOVE, such as \"This relationship isn't going anywhere,\" ((215)) \"There was a magnetism between us,\" and \"This relationship is dying.\" The concept LOVE iS not inherently well defined. Our culture gives us conventional ways of viewing love experiences via conventional metaphors, such as LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE, etc., and\nour language reflects these. But according to the objectivist account (based either on dead metaphor, weak homonymy, or abstraction), the concept LOVE must be sufficiently well defined in terms of inherent properties to bear inherent similarities to journeys, electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena, sick people, etc. Here the objectivist must not only bear the burden of claiming that love has inherent properties similar to the inherent properties of journeys, electromagnetic phenomena, and sick people; he must also claim that love is sufficiently clearly defined in terms of these inherent properties so that those similarities will exist. In summary, the usual objectivist accounts of these phenomena (dead metaphor, homonymy with similarities, or abstraction) all depend on preexisting similarities based on inherent properties. In general, similarities do exist, but they cannot be based on inherent properties. The similarities arise as a result of conceptual metaphors and thus must be considered similarities of interactional, rather than inherent, properties. But the admission of interactional properties is inconsistent with the basic premise of objectivist philosophy. It amounts to giving up the myth of objectivism. The Objectivist Default: \"It's Not Our Joh\" The only remaining alternative for the objectivist is to give up any account of any relationship between the FOOD and IDEA senses of digest in terms of similarity (including denial that there was ever a metaphor at all) and to turn to the strong homonymy position. According to this view there is one word digest with two entirely different and unrelated meanings—as different as the two meanings of punt (a kick ((216)) in football and an open, flat-bottomed boat with square ends). As we have seen (in chapter 18), the strong homonymy position cannot account for: Internal systematicity External systematicity Extensions of the used portion of the metaphor The use of concrete experience to structure abstract experience The similarities that we, in fact, see between the two senses of digest, based on metaphorically conceptualizing ideas in terms of food. Of course, an objectivist philosopher or linguist could grant that he cannot adequately account for such systematicities, similarities, and ways of understanding the less concrete in terms of the more concrete. This might not disturb him in the slightest. After all, he could claim, accounting for such things is not his job. Such things are matters for the psychologist, the neurophysiologist, the philologist, or someone else. This would be in the tradition of Frege's separating off \"sense\" from \"ideas\" and Lewis's separat-ing off \"abstract semantic systems\" from \"psychological and sociological facts.\" The homonymy view, they could claim, is adequate for their proper purposes as objectivists, namely, to provide objective truth conditions for linguistic expressions and to give an account of literal objective meaning in terms of them. This, they assume, could be done independently for the two senses of digest without having to account for systematicity, similarity, understanding,\netc. Relative to this conception of their job, conventional metaphorical uses of digest involve merely homonyms and not metaphors at all, dead or alive. The only metaphors they recognize are nonconventional metaphors (e.g., \"Your ideas are made of cheap stucco\" or \"Love is a collaborative work of art\"). Since these, they would claim, are matters of speaker's meaning, not the literal objective meaning of a sentence, issues of truth and meaning arising from them are to be handled by the account of speaker's meaning given above. ((217)) In summary, the only internally consistent objectivist view of conventional metaphor would be that the issues we have been primarily concerned with—the properties of conventional metaphors and the way we use them in understanding—are simply outside their purview. They would insist that they are not responsible for such matters and that no facts of this sort concerning conventional metaphor could possibly have any bearing on the objectivist program or on what they, as objectivists, believe. Such objectivists might even grant that our investigations of metaphor correctly show that interactional properties and experiential gestalts are, in fact, necessary to account for how human beings understand their experience via metaphor. But even granting this, they could still continue to ignore everything we have done on the following grounds: they could say simply that experientialists are merely concerned with how human beings happen to under-stand reality, given all of their limitations, whereas the objectivist is concerned not with how people understand something as being true but rather with what it means for something to actually he true. This objectivist response perfectly highlights the fundamental difference between objectivism and experientialism. Such an objectivist reply boils down to a reaffirmation of their fundamental concern with \"absolute truth\" and \"objective meaning,\" entirely independent of anything having to do with human functioning or understanding. Against this, we have been maintaining that there is no reason to believe that there is any absolute truth or objective mean-ing. Instead, we maintain that it is possible to give an ac-count of truth and meaning only relative to the way people function in the world and understand it. We are simply in a different philosophical universe from such objectivists. The Irrelevance of Objectivist Philosophy to Human Concerns We are in the same philosophical universe as, and have real disagreements with, those objectivists who think that there ((218))\ncan be an adequate objectivist account of human under-standing, of our conceptual system and our natural language. We have argued in detail that conventional metaphor is pervasive in human language and the human conceptual system and that it is a primary vehicle for understanding. We have argued that an adequate account of understanding requires interactional properties and experiential gestalts. Since all objectivist accounts require inherent properties and most of them require a set-theoretical account of categorization, they fail to give an adequate account of how human beings conceptualize the world. Objectivist Models Outside of Objectivist Philosophy Classical mathematics comprises an objectivist universe. It has entities that are clearly distinguished from one another, e.g., numbers. Mathematical entities have inherent prop- erties, e.g., three is odd. And there are fixed relationships among those entities, e.g., nine is the square of three. Mathematical logic was developed as part of the enterprise of providing foundations for classical mathematics. Formal semantics also developed out of that enterprise. The models used in formal semantics are examples of what we will call \"objectivist models\"—models appropriate to universes of discourse where there are distinct entities which have in-herent properties and where there are fixed relationships among the entities. But the real world is not an objectivist universe, especially those aspects of the real world having to do with human beings: human experience, human institutions, human language, the human conceptual system. What it means to be a hard-core objectivist is to claim that there is an objectivist model that fits the world as it really is. We have just argued that objectivist philosophy is empirically incorrect in that it makes false predictions about language, truth, understanding, and the human conceptual system. On the basis of this we have claimed that objectivist philosophy provides an inadequate basis for the human sciences. ((219)) Nonetheless, a lot of remarkably insightful mathematicians, logicians, linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists have designed objectivist models for use in the human sciences. Are we claiming that all of this work is worthless and that objectivist models have no place at all in the human sciences? We are claiming no such thing. We believe that objectivist models as mathematical entities do not necessarily have to be tied to objectivist philosophy. One can believe that objectivist models can have a function—even an important function—in the human sciences without adopting the objectivist premise that there is an objectivist model that completely and accurately fits the world as it really is. But if we reject this premise, what role is left for objectivist models? Before we can answer this question, we need to look at some of the properties of ontological and structural metaphors: Ontological metaphors are among the most basic devices we have for comprehending our experience. Each structural metaphor has a consistent set of ontological metaphors as sub-parts. To use a set of ontological metaphors to comprehend a given situation is to impose an entity structure upon that situation. For example, LOVE IS A JOURNEY imposes on\nLOVE an entity structure including a beginning, a destination, a path, the distance you are along the path, and so on. Each individual structural metaphor is internally consistent and imposes a consistent structure on the concept it structures. For example, the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor imposes an internally consistent WAR structure on the concept ARGUMENT. When we understand love only in terms of the LOVE IS A JOURNEY metaphor, we are imposing an internally consistent JOURNEY structure on the concept LOVE. Although different metaphors for the same concept are not in general consistent with each other, it is possible to find sets of metaphors that are consistent with each other. Let us call these consistent sets of metaphors. Because each individual metaphor is internally consistent, each ((220)) consistent set of metaphors allows us to comprehend a situation in terms of a well-defined entity structure with consistent relations between the entities. The way that a consistent set of metaphors imposes an entity structure with a set of relations between the entities can be represented by an objectivist model. In the model, the entities are those imposed by the ontological metaphors, and the relations between the entities are those given by the internal structures of the structural metaphors. To summarize: Trying to structure a situation in terms of such a consistent set of metaphors is in part like trying to structure that situation in terms of an objectivist model. What is left out are the experiential bases of the metaphors and what the metaphors hide. The natural question to ask, then, is whether people actually think and act in terms of consistent sets of metaphors. A special case where they do is in the formula-tion of scientific theories, say, in biology, psychology, or linguistics. Formal scientific theories are attempts to consistently extend a set of ontological and structural metaphors. But in addition to scientific theorizing, we feel that people do try to think and act in terms of consistent sets of metaphors in a wide variety of situations. These are cases where people might be viewed as trying to apply objectivist models to their experience. There is an excellent reason for people to try to view a life situation in terms of an objectivist model, that is, in terms of a consistent set of metaphors. The reason is, simply, that if we can do this, we can draw inferences about the situation that will not conflict with one another. That is, we will be able to infer nonconflicting expectations and suggestions for behavior. And it is comforting-extremely comforting—to have a consistent view of the world, a clear set of expectations and no conflicts about what you should do. Objectivist models have a real appeal—and for the most human of reasons. We do not wish to belittle this appeal. It is the same as the\n((221)) appeal of finding coherence in your life or in some range of life experiences. Having a basis for expectation and action is important for survival. But it is one thing to impose a single objectivist model in some restricted situations and to function in terms of that model— perhaps successfully; it is another to conclude that the model is an accurate reflection of reality. There is a good reason why our conceptual systems have inconsistent metaphors for a single concept. The reason is that there is no one metaphor that will do. Each one gives a certain comprehension of one aspect of the concept and hides others. To operate only in terms of a consistent set of metaphors is to hide many aspects of reality. Successful functioning in our daily lives seems to re-quire a constant shifting of metaphors. The use of many metaphors that are inconsistent with one another seems necessary for us if we are to comprehend the details of our daily existence. One obvious utility for the study of formal objectivist models in the human sciences is that they can allow us to understand, in part, the ability to reason and function in terms of a consistent set of metaphors. This is a common activity and an important one to understand. It can also allow us to see what can be wrong with imposing a require-ment of consistency— to see that any consistent set of metaphors will most likely hide indefinitely many aspects of reality—aspects that can be highlighted only by other metaphors that are inconsistent with it. One obvious limitation of formal models is that, so far as we can imagine, they provide no means for including the experiential basis for a metaphor and therefore provide no way of accounting for the way in which metaphorical concepts permit us to comprehend our experience. There is a corollary of this that has to do with the issue of whether a computer could ever understand things the way people do. The answer we give is no—simply because understanding requires experience, and computers don't have bodies and don't have human experiences. ((222)) However, the study of computational models might nevertheless tell us a great deal about human intellectual capacities, especially in the areas where people reason and function partly in terms of objectivist models. Moreover, current formal techniques in computer science show prom-ise of providing representations of inconsistent sets of metaphors. This could conceivably lead to insights about the way that people reason and function in terms of coherent, but inconsistent, metaphorical concepts. The limits of formal study seem to be in the area of the experiential bases of our conceptual system. Summary Our general conclusion is that the objectivist program is unable to give a satisfactory account of human under-standing and of any issues requiring such an account. Among these issues are:\nthe human conceptual system and the nature of human rationality —human language and communication the human sciences, especially psychology, anthropology, sociology, and linguistics moral and aesthetic value —scientific understanding, via the human conceptual system —any way in which the foundations of mathematics have a basis in human understanding The basic elements of an experientialist account of understanding—interactional properties, experiential gestalts, and metaphorical concepts—seem to be necessary for any adequate treatment of these human issues. ((223)) 28. Some Inadequacies of the Myth of Subjectivism In Western culture, the chief alternative to objectivism has traditionally been taken to be subjectivism. We have argued that the myth of objectivism is inadequate to account for human understanding, human language, human values, human social and cultural institutions, and everything dealt with by the human sciences. Thus, according to the di- chotomy that our culture would foist upon us, we would be left only with a radical subjectivity, which denies the possibility of any scientific \"lawlike\" account of human realities. But we have claimed that subjectivism is not the only alternative to objectivism, and we have been offering a third choice: the experientialist myth, which we see as making possible an adequate philosophical and methodological basis for the human sciences. We have already distinguished this alternative from the objectivist program, and it is equally important to distinguish it from a subjectivist pro-gram. Let us consider briefly some subjectivist positions on how people understand their\nexperience and their language. These flow mainly from the Romantic tradition and are to be found in contemporary interpretations (probably misinterpretations) of recent Continental philosophy, especially the traditions of phenomenology and existentialism. Such subjectivist interpretations are largely popularizations that pick and choose elements of antiobjectivist Continental philosophy, often ignoring what makes certain trends in Continental thought serious attempts to provide a basis for the human sciences. These subjectivist positions, listed ril Ill ((224)) below, might be characterized jointly as \"cafe phenome-nology.\" They include: Meaning is private: Meaning is always a matter of what is meaningful and significant to a\nperson. What an individual finds significant and what it means to him are matters of intuition, imagination, feeling, and individual experience. What some-thing means to one individual can never be fully known or communicated to anyone else. Experience is purely holistic: There is no natural structuring to our experience. Any structure that we or others place on our experience is completely artificial. Meanings have no natural structure: Meaning to an individual is a matter of his private feelings, experiences, intuitions, and values. These are purely holistic; they have no natural structure. Thus, meanings have no natural structure. Context is unstructured: The context needed for understanding an utterance—the physical, cultural, personal, and inter-personal context—has no natural structure. Meaning cannot he naturally or adequately represented: This is a consequence of the facts that meanings have no natural structure, that they can never be fully known or communicated to another person, and that the context needed to understand them is unstructured. These subjectivist positions all hinge on one basic assumption, namely, that experience has no natural structure and that, therefore, there can be no natural external constraints upon meaning and truth. Our reply follows directly from our account of how our conceptual system is grounded. We have argued that our experience is structured holistically in terms of experiential gestalts. These gestalts have structure that is not arbitrary. Instead, the dimensions that characterize the structure of the gestalts emerge naturally from our experience. This is not to deny the possibility that what something means to me may be based on kinds of experiences that I have had and you have not had and that, therefore, I will ((225)) not be able to fully and adequately communicate that meaning to you. However, metaphor provides a way of partially communicating unshared experiences, and it is the natural structure of our experience that makes this possible. ((226))\n29. The Experientialist Alternative: Giving New Meaning to the Old Myths The fact that the myths of subjectivism and objectivism have stood for so long in Western culture indicates that each serves some important function. Each myth is motivated by real and reasonable concerns, and each has some grounding in our cultural experience. What Experientialism Preserves of the Concerns That Motivate Objectivism The fundamental concern of the myth of objectivism is the world external to the individual. The myth rightly emphasizes the fact that there are real things, existing in-dependently of us, which constrain both how we interact with them and how we comprehend them. Objectivism's focus on truth and factual knowledge is based on the importance of such knowledge for successful functioning in our physical and cultural environment. The myth is also motivated by a concern for fairness and impartiality in cases where that matters and can be achieved in some reasonable fashion. The experientialist myth, as we have been sketching it, shares all these concerns. Experientialism departs from objectivism, however, on two fundamental issues: Is there an absolute truth? Is absolute truth necessary to meet the above concerns—the concern with knowledge that allows us to function successfully and the concern with fairness and impartiality? Experientialism answers no to both questions. Truth is ((227)) always relative to understanding, which is based on a nonuniversal conceptual system. But this does not preclude satisfying the legitimate concerns about knowledge and im-partiality that have motivated the myth of objectivism for centuries. Objectivity is still possible, but it takes on a new meaning. Objectivity still involves rising above individual bias, whether in matters of knowledge or value. But where objectivity is reasonable, it does not require an absolute, universally valid point of view. Being objective is always relative to a conceptual system and a set of cultural values. Reasonable objectivity may be impossible when there are conflicting conceptual systems or conflicting cultural values, and it is important to be able to admit this and to recognize when it occurs. According to the experientialist myth, scientific knowledge is still possible. But giving up\nthe claim to absolute truth could make scientific practice more responsible, since there would be a general awareness that a scientific theory may hide as much as it highlights. A general realization that science does not yield absolute truth would no doubt change the power and prestige of the scientific community as well as the funding practices of the federal government. The result would be a more reasonable assessment of what scientific knowledge is and what its limitations are. What Experientialism Preserves of the Concerns That Motivate Subjectivism What legitimately motivates subjectivism is the awareness that meaning is always meaning to a person. What's meaningful to me is a matter of what has significance for me. And what is significant for me will not depend on my rational knowledge alone but on my past experiences, values, feelings, and intuitive insights. Meaning is not cut and dried; it is a matter of imagination and a matter of constructing coherence. The objectivist emphasis on achieving a universally valid point of view misses what is important, insight-ful, and coherent for the individual. ((228)) The experientialist myth agrees that understanding does involve all of these elements. Its emphasis on interaction and interactional properties shows how meaning always is meaning to a person. And its emphasis on the construction of coherence via experiential gestalts provides an account of what it means for something to be significant to an individual. Moreover, it gives an account of how understanding uses the primary resources of the imagination via metaphor and how it is possible to give experience new meaning and to create new realities. Where experientialism diverges from subjectivism is in its rejection of the Romantic idea that imaginative understand-ing is completely unconstrained. In summary, we see the experientialist myth as capable of satisfying the real and reasonable concerns that have motivated the myths of both subjectivism and objectivism but without either the objectivist obsession with absolute truth or the subjectivist insistence that imagination is totally un-restricted. ((229))\n30. Understanding We see a single human motivation behind the myths of both objectivism and subjectivism, namely, a concern for under-standing. The myth of objectivism reflects the human need to understand the external world in order to be able to function successfully in it. The myth of subjectivism is focused on internal aspects of understanding—what the individual finds meaningful and what makes his life worth liv-ing. The experientialist myth suggests that these are not opposing concerns. It offers a perspective from which both concerns can be met at once. The old myths share a common perspective: man as separate from his environment. Within the myth of objectivism, the concern for truth grows out of a concern for successful functioning. Given a view of man as separate from his environment, successful functioning is conceived of as mastery over the environment. Hence, the objectivist metaphors KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and SCIENCE PROVIDES CONTROL OVER NATURE. The principal theme of the myth of subjectivism is the attempt to overcome the alienation that results from view-ing man as separate from his environment and from other men. This involves an embracing of the self—of individuality and reliance upon personal feelings, intuition, and values. The Romanticist version involves reveling in the senses and the feelings and attempting to gain union with nature through passive appreciation of it. The experientialist myth takes the perspective of man as part of his environment, not as separate from it. It focuses ((230)) on constant interaction with the physical environment and with other people. It views this interaction with the environment as involving mutual change. You cannot function within the environment without changing it or being changed by it. Within the experientialist myth, understanding emerges from interaction, from constant negotiation with the environment and other people. It emerges in the following way: the nature of our bodies and our physical and cultural environment imposes a structure on our experience, in terms of natural dimensions of the sort we have discussed. Re-current experience leads to the formation of categories, which are experiential gestalts with those natural dimensions. Such gestalts define coherence in our experience. We understand our experience directly when we see it as being structured coherently in terms of gestalts that have emerged directly from interaction with and in our environment. We understand experience metaphorically when we use a gestalt from one domain of experience to structure experience in another domain. From the experientialist perspective, truth depends on understanding, which emerges from functioning\nin the world. It is through such understanding that the experientialist alternative meets the objectivist's need for an ac-count of truth. It is through the coherent structuring of experience that the experientialist alternative satisfies the subjectivist's need for personal meaning and significance. But experientialism provides more than just a synthesis that meets the motivating concerns of objectivism and subjectivism. The experientialist account of understanding provides a richer perspective on some of the most important areas of experience in our everyday lives: Interpersonal communication and mutual understanding Self-understanding Ritual Aesthetic experience Politics ((231)) We feel that objectivism and subjectivism both provide impoverished views of all of these areas because each misses the motivating concerns of the other. What they both miss in all of these areas is an interactionally based and creative understanding. Let us turn to an experientialist account of the nature of understanding in each of these areas. Interpersonal Communication and Mutual Understanding When people who are talking don't share the same culture, knowledge, values, and assumptions, mutual understanding can be especially difficult. Such understanding is possible through the negotiation of meaning. To negotiate meaning with someone, you have to become aware of and respect both the differences in your backgrounds and when these differences are important. You need enough diversity of cultural and personal experience to he aware that divergent world views exist and what they might he like. You also need patience, a certain flexibility in world view, and a generous tolerance for mistakes, as well as a talent for finding the right metaphor to communicate the relevant parts of unshared experiences or to highlight the shared experiences while deemphasizing the others. Metaphorical imagination is a crucial skill in creating rapport and in communicating the nature of unshared experience. This skill consists, in large measure, of the ability to bend your world view and adjust the way you categorize your experience. Problems of mutual understanding are not exotic; they arise in all ex-tended conversations where understanding is important. When it really counts, meaning is almost never communicated according to the CONDUIT metaphor, that is, where one person transmits a fixed, clear proposition to another by means of expressions in a common language, where both parties have all the relevant common knowledge, assumptions, values, etc. When the chips are down, meaning is negotiated: you slowly figure out what you have in common,\n((232)) what it is safe to talk about, how you can communicate unshared experience or create a shared vision. With enough flexibility in bending your world view and with luck and skill and charity, you may achieve some mutual understanding. Communication theories based on the CONDUIT metaphor turn from the pathetic to the evil when they are applied in-discriminately on a large scale, say, in government sur- veillance or computerized files. There, what is most crucial for real understanding is almost never included, and it is assumed that the words in the file have meaning in themselves— disembodied, objective, understandable meaning. When a society lives by the CONDUIT metaphor on a large scale, misunderstanding, persecution, and much worse are the likely products. Self-understanding The capacity for self-understanding presupposes the capacity for mutual understanding. Common sense tells us that it's easier to understand ourselves than to understand other people. After all, we tend to think that we have direct access to our own feelings and ideas and not to anybody else's. Self-understanding seems prior to mutual under-standing, and in some ways it is. But any really deep under-standing of why we do what we do, feel what we feel, change as we change, and even believe what we believe, takes us beyond ourselves. Understanding of ourselves is not unlike other forms of understanding—it comes out of our constant interactions with our physical, cultural, and interpersonal environment. At a minimum, the skills required for mutual understanding are necessary even to approach self-understanding. Just as in mutual understanding we constantly search out commonalities of experience when we speak with other people, so in self-understanding we are always search-ing for what unifies our own diverse experiences in order to give coherence to our lives. Just as we seek out metaphors to highlight and make coherent what we have in common with ((233)) someone else, so we seek out personal metaphors to high-light and make coherent our own pasts, our present activities, and our dreams, hopes, and goals as well. A large part of self- understanding is the search for appropriate personal metaphors that make sense of our lives. Self-understanding requires unending negotiation and renegotiation of the meaning of your experiences to yourself. In therapy, for example, much of self-understanding involves consciously recognizing previously unconscious metaphors and how we live by them. It involves the constant construction of new coherences in your life, coherences that give new meaning to old experiences. The process of self-understanding is the continual development of new life stories for yourself. The experientialist approach to the process of self-understanding involves:\nDeveloping an awareness of the metaphors we live by and an awareness of where they enter into our everyday lives and where they do not Having experiences that can form the basis of alternative metaphors Developing an \"experiential flexibility\" Engaging in an unending process of viewing your life through new alternative metaphors Ritual We are constantly performing rituals, from casual rituals, like making the morning coffee by the same sequence of steps each day and watching the eleven o'clock news straight to the end (after we've seen it already at six o'clock); to going to football games, Thanksgiving dinners, and university lectures by distinguished visitors; and so on to the most solemn prescribed religious practices. All are repeated structured practices, some consciously designed in detail, some more consciously performed than others, and some emerging spontaneously. Each ritual is a re- ((234)) peated, coherently structured, and unified aspect of our experience. In performing them, we give structure and significance to our activities, minimizing chaos and dis-parity in our actions. In our terms, a ritual is one kind of experiential gestalt. It is a coherent sequence of actions, structured in terms of the natural dimensions of our experience. Religious rituals are typically metaphorical kinds of activities, which usually involve metonymies—real-world objects standing for entities in the world as defined by the conceptual system of the religion. The coherent structure of the ritual is commonly taken as paralleling some aspect of reality as it is seen through the religion. Everyday personal rituals are also experiential gestalts consisting of sequences of actions structured along the natural dimensions of experience—a part-whole structure, stages, causal relationships, and means of accomplishing goals. Personal rituals are thus natural kinds of activities for individuals or for members of a subculture. They may or may not be metaphorical kinds of activities. For example, it is common in Los Angeles to engage in the ritual activity of driving by the homes of Hollywood stars. This is a metaphorical kind of activity based on the metonymy THE HOME STANDS FOR THE PERSON and the metaphor PHYSICAL CLOSENESS IS PERSONAL CLOSENESS. Other everyday ritu- als, whether metaphorical or not, provide experiential gestalts that can be the basis of metaphors, e.g., \"You don't know what you're opening the door to,\" \"Let's roll up our sleeves and get down to work,\" etc. We suggest that The metaphors we live by, whether cultural or personal, are partially preserved in ritual. Cultural metaphors, and the values entailed by them, are propagated by ritual. Ritual forms an indispensable part of the experiential basis for our cultural metaphorical systems. There can be no culture without ritual.\n((235)) Similarly, there can be no coherent view of the self with-out personal ritual (typically of the casual and spontaneously emerging sort). Just as our personal metaphors are not random but form systems coherent with our personalities, so our personal rituals are not random but are coherent with our view of the world and ourselves and with our system of personal metaphors and metonymies. Our implicit and typically unconscious conceptions of ourselves and the values that we live by are perhaps most strongly reflected in the little things we do over and over, that is, in the casual rituals that have emerged spontaneously in our daily lives. Aesthetic Experience From the experientialist perspective, metaphor is a matter of imaginative rationality. It permits an understanding of one kind of experience in terms of another, creating coher- ences by virtue of imposing gestalts that are structured by natural dimensions of experience. New metaphors are capable of creating new understandings and, therefore, new realities. This should be obvious in the case of poetic metaphor, where language is the medium through which new conceptual metaphors are created. But metaphor is not merely a matter of language. It is a matter of conceptual structure. And conceptual structure is not merely a matter of the intellect—it involves all the natural dimensions of our experience, including aspects of our sense experiences: color, shape, texture, sound, etc. These dimensions structure not only mundane experience but aesthetic experience as well. Each art medium picks out certain dimensions of our experience and excludes others. Artworks provide new ways of structuring our experience in terms of these natural dimensions. Works of art provide new experiential gestalts and, therefore, new coherences. From the experientialist point of view, art is, in general, a ((236)) matter of imaginative rationality and a means of creating new realities. Aesthetic experience is thus not limited to the official art world. It can occur in any aspect of our everyday lives—whenever we take note of, or create for ourselves, new coherences that are not part of our conventionalized mode of perception or thought. Politics Political debate typically is concerned with issues of free-dom and economics. But one can be both free and economically secure while leading a totally meaningless and empty\nexistence. We see the metaphorical concepts of FREEDOM, EQUALITY, SAFETY, ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE, POWER, etc., as being different ways of getting indirectly at issues of meaningful existence. They are all necessary aspects of an adequate discussion of the issue, but, to our knowledge, no political ideology addresses the main issue head-on. In fact, many ideologies argue that matters of personal or cultural meaningfulness are secondary or to be addressed later. Any such ideology is dehumanizing. Political and economic ideologies are framed in metaphorical terms. Like all other metaphors, political and economic metaphors can hide aspects of reality. But in the area of politics and economics, metaphors matter more, because they constrain our lives. A metaphor in a political or economic system, by virtue of what it hides, can lead to human degradation. Consider just one example: LABOR IS A RESOURCE. Most contemporary economic theories, whether capitalist or socialist, treat labor as a natural resource or commodity, on a par with raw materials, and speak in the same terms of its cost and supply. What is hidden by the metaphor is the nature of the labor. No distinction is made between meaningful labor and dehumanizing labor. For all of the labor ((237)) statistics, there is none on meaningful labor. When we accept the LABOR IS A RESOURCE metaphor and assume that the cost of resources defined in this way should be kept down, then cheap labor becomes a good thing, on a par with cheap oil. The exploitation of human beings through this metaphor is most obvious in countries that boast of \"a virtually inexhaustible supply of cheap labor\"—a neutral-sounding economic statement that hides the reality of human degradation. But virtually all major industrialized nations, whether capitalist or socialist, use the same metaphor in their economic theories and policies. The blind acceptance of the metaphor can hide degrading realities, whether meaningless blue- collar and white-collar industrial jobs in \"advanced\" societies or virtual slavery around the world. Afterword Collaborating on this book has given us the opportunity to explore our ideas not only with each other but with literally hundreds of people—students and colleagues, friends, relatives, acquaintances, even strangers at the next cafe table. And after having worked out all of the consequences we could think of, for philosophy and for linguistics, what stands out most in our minds are the metaphors themselves and the insights they have given us into our own daily experiences. We still react with awe when we notice ourselves and those around us living by metaphors like TIME IS MONEY, LOVE IS A JOURNEY, and PROBLEMS ARE PUZZLES. We continually find it important to realize that the way we have been brought up to perceive our world is not the only way and that it is possible to see beyond the \"truths\" of our culture. But metaphors are not merely things to he seen beyond. In fact, one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors. It is as though the ability to comprehend experience through metaphor were a sense, like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors providing the\nonly ways to perceive and experience much of the world. Metaphor is as much a part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as precious. ((239)) References Cooper, William E., and Ross, John Robert. 1975. \"World Order.\" In Robin E. Grossman, L.

Our original motivation was to awaken readers throughout the world to the often beautiful, sometimes disturbing, but always profound, realities of everyday metaphorical thought. By bringing metaphorical thought into the limelight, this book revealed the need to rethink some of the most fundamental ideas in the study of mind: meaning, truth, the na- ture of thought, and the role of the body in the shaping of mind. As a result it had far- reaching implications in field after field—not just linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy but also literary studies, politics, law, clinical psychology, religion, and even mathematics and the philosophy of science. How we think metaphorically matters. It can determine questions of war and peace, economic policy, and legal decisions, as well as the mundane choices of everyday life. Is a military attack a \"rape,\" \"a threat to our security,\" or \"the defense of a population against terrorism\"? The same at-tack can be conceptualized in any of these ways with very different military consequences. Is your marriage a partner-ship, a journey through life together, a haven from the out-side world, a means for growth, or a union of two people into a third entity? The choice among such common ways of conceptualizing marriage can determine what your marriage becomes. Drastic metaphorical differences can result in marital conflict. Take for example the case where one spouse views marriage as a partnership, and the other ((244))\nspouse views it as a haven. The responsibilities of a partnership may well be at odds with the relief from responsibilities characteristic of a haven. Metaphorical thought is normal and ubiquitous in our mental life, both conscious and unconscious. The same mechanisms of metaphorical thought used throughout poetry are present in our most common concepts: time, events, causation, emotion, ethics, and business, to name but a few. Conceptual metaphors even lie behind the build-ing of computer interfaces (e.g., the desktop metaphor) and the structuring of the Internet into \"information highways,\" \"department stores,\" \"chat rooms,\" `\"auction houses,\" \"amusement parks,\" and so on. It is the systematicity of metaphorical thought that permits such applications. The heart of metaphor is inference. Conceptual metaphor allows inferences in sensory-motor domains (e.g., domains of space and objects) to be used to draw inferences about other domains (e.g., domains of subjective judgment, with concepts like intimacy, emotions, justice, and so on). Be-cause we reason in terms of metaphor, the metaphors we use determine a great deal about how we live our lives. Persistent Fallacies There are four major historical harriers to understanding the nature of metaphorical thought and its profundity, and these amount to four false views of metaphor. In the West-ern tradition, they all go back at least as far as Aristotle. The first fallacy is that metaphor is a matter of words, not concepts. The second is that metaphor is based on similarity. The third is that all concepts are literal and that none can be metaphorical. The fourth is that rational thought is in no way shaped by the nature of our brains and bodies. Further research subsequent to this book has established conclusively that all four views are false. First, the locus of metaphor is in concepts not words. Second, metaphor is, in general, not based on similarity, as we argued throughout ((245)) this book. Instead, it is typically based on cross-domain correlations in our experience, which give rise to the perceived similarities between the two domains within the metaphor. For example, the persistent use of a metaphor may create perceived similarities, as when a love relation-ship, conceived of metaphorically as a partnership, goes awry when responsibilities and benefits are not shared equally. Third, even our deepest and most abiding concepts—time, events, causation, morality, and mind itself—are understood and reasoned about via multiple metaphors. In each case, one conceptual domain (say, time) is reasoned about, as well as talked about, in terms of the conceptual structure of another domain (say, space). Fourth, the system of conceptual metaphors is not arbitrary or just historically contingent; rather, it is shaped to a significant extent by the common nature of our bodies and the shared ways that we all function in the everyday world. Yet, despite all the evidence for the pervasiveness of conceptual metaphor, these long- standing, mistaken assumptions not just about metaphor but about meaning in general have persisted. These age-old, a priori philosophical views are so deeply engrained that they blind many readers to any evidence to the contrary. The single biggest obstacle to understanding our findings has been the refusal to\nrecognize the conceptual nature of metaphor. The idea that metaphors are nothing but linguistic expressions—a mere matter of words—is such a common fallacy that it has kept many readers from even entertaining the idea that we think metaphorically. The fal-lacy is that metaphor is only about the ways we talk and not about conceptualization and reasoning. Countering this view is a huge body of empirical evidence gained from many different methods of inquiry that reveals the central role of metaphor in abstract thought. It is not surprising that someone raised with the traditional view would continue to deny or ignore this evidence, since to accept it would require large-scale revisions of the way he or ((246)) she understands not only metaphor but concepts, meaning, language, knowledge, and truth as well. Because there is so much at stake, these fallacies about metaphor are difficult to eliminate. They have been around for over two thousand years. Yet they are wrong, that is, they are at odds with the empirical evidence. The fact that they are wrong is no small matter. It has implications for all aspects of our lives, including war and peace, the environ- ment, health, and other political and social issues. It bears directly on how we understand our own personal lives, and it bears directly on intellectual disciplines like philosophy, mathematics, and literary studies, all of which ultimately have important cultural effects. Evidence for Conceptual Metaphor It is crucial to recognize that questions about the nature of meaning, conceptualization, reasoning, and language are questions requiring empirical study; they cannot be answered adequately by mere a priori philosophizing. The na-ture of metaphor also is not a matter of definition; it is a question of the nature of cognition. Do we systematically use inference patterns .from one conceptual domain to reason about another conceptual do-main? The empirically established answer is \"yes.\" We call that phenomenon conceptual metaphor, and we call the systematic correspondences across such domains metaphorical mappings. This leads to a further empirical question: Are those metaphorical mappings purely abstract and arbi- trary? The empirical answer is \"no.\" They are shaped and con-strained by our bodily experiences in the world, experiences in which the two conceptual domains are correlated and consequently establish mappings from one domain to\n((247)) another. Finally, there is a corresponding question about the nature of language: Is all ordinary, conventionuli:ed, evemlay language literal, or can common everyday linguistic expressions be metaphorical? The answer is empirical: A great deal of everyday, conventional language is metaphorical, and the metaphorical meanings are given by conceptual metaphorical mappings that ultimately arise from correlations in our embodied experience. In short, metaphor is a natural phenomenon. Conceptual metaphor is a natural part of human thought, and linguistic metaphor is a natural part of human language. Moreover, which metaphors we have and what they mean depend on the nature of our bodies, our interactions in the physical environment, and our social and cultural practices. Every question about the nature of conceptual metaphor and its role in thought and language is an empirical question. What is needed is still more empirical research that seeks converging evidence and is gathered by using different empirical methods of inquiry. Multiple methods of inquiry, with different methodological assumptions, have been used effectively to date. This has allowed researchers to avoid having evidence dictated a priori by the assumptions of any one particular methodology (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 6). hn 1980 we had evidence for the theory of conceptual metaphor from only two areas of research: Systematic polysenny: In this area of research, entire lexical fields of words not only have literal meanings in a concrete domain but also have systematically related meanings in abstract domains. For example, up, down, rise, fall, high, low, hit bottom, and so on, are not only about verticality but also quantity. Thus, the conceptual metaphor More Is Up explains why we use the polysemous word rise, for exam- pie, to mean both increase in elevation and increase in quantity. The conceptual metaphor explains the systematicity of the polysemy, and correspondingly, the systematic polysemy provides evidence for the existence of the metaphor. ((248)) Generalizations over inference patterns: A fundamental finding here is that reasoning in abstract domains uses the logic of our sensory-motor experience. For example, if something rises physically, it is higher than it was before. If the price of something \"rises\" (metaphorically), then it is \"higher\" (metaphorically) than it was before. The metaphor More Is Up maps the inference pattern about physical heights onto the inference pattern about amounts. By hypothesizing the metaphor, we can see that these two apparently different inference patterns are in fact the same. Moreover, by hypothesizing a single More Is Up metaphor mapping verticality to quantity, we could account for both the polysemous use of words and the generalization over inferences. In other words, there were then two sources of evidence—polysemy and inference—for that conceptual metaphor. After twenty years of research by hundreds of investigators, vast bodies of empirical evidence for conceptual metaphor have been gathered from studies in a wide range of fields within the cognitive sciences. We initially had two primary sources of evidence—polysemy\ngeneralizations and inference generalizations. We now have at least seven other types of evidence derived from various empirical methods: 1.extensions to poetic and novel cases (Lakoff and Turner 1989) 2.psychological research, for example, priming studies (Gibbs 1994; Boroditzky 2000) 3.gesture studies (McNeill 1992) 4.historical semantic change research (Sweetser 1990) 5.discourse analysis (Narayanan 1997) ((249)) 6.sign language analysis (Taub 1997) 7.language acquisition (C. Johnson 1999) The importance of this evidence is that it comes from many different methodologies and no longer rests exclusively on data from linguistic forms and inferences. These new sources have produced converging results concerning the way metaphor lies at the heart of abstract thought and symbolic expression. Developments in Metaphor Theory Over the years, the theory of metaphor has developed and deepened considerably. The evidence for the existence and pervasiveness of conceptual metaphor has mounted, giving us a much clearer picture of how metaphor structures thought. Initially we had only guessed that conceptual metaphors were grounded in bodily experience. In the early 1980s, Lakoff and Kovecses showed that the system of metaphors for anger arose, across languages and cultures, from the physiology of anger itself (Lakoff 1987; Kovecses 1986, 1990). By the early 1990s, a whole new level of metaphor analysis was discovered that we will call deep analysis. What we and other researchers found was that our most fundamental ideas—not just time, but events, causation, morality, the self, and so on—were almost entirely structured by elaborate systems of conceptual metaphor. Even the basic concepts of causation used in the physical and social sciences are primarily constituted by a system of nearly two dozen distinct metaphors, each with its own causal logic (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 11). Thus, causa-tion can be conceptualized in terms of forced motion to a new location (as in, \"Scientific developments have propelled us into the Digital Age\"), the giving and taking of objects (\"These vitamins will give you energy\"), links (\"Cancer has been linked to pesticide use\"), motion along a ((250)) path (\"China is on the road to democracy, having taken the pcith of capitalism\"), and so on. This discovery was particularly startling, even to us, because it challenged the wide-spread view that there is a single kind of causation with a single causal logic structuring the world. Deep analysis further revealed that our basic understand-ing of morality arises via conceptual metaphor. There is a system of approximately two dozen metaphors that arise spontaneously out of\ncommon, everyday experience in cultures around the world (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 15). Since morality is concerned with well-being, whether one's own or that of another, fundamental experiences concerning well-being give rise to conceptual metaphors for morality. People are better off in general if they are strong not weak; if they can stand upright rather than having to crawl; if they eat pure, not rotten, food; and so on. These correlations give rise to metaphors of morality as strength and immorality as weakness, morality as uprightness and immorality as being low, morality as purity and immorality as rot, and so on. Since you are better off if you have the things you need rather than if you don't, there is a correlation of well-being with wealth. Hence, there is a wide-spread metaphor in which moral action is conceptualized as increasing another's well-being, which is metaphorically understood as increasing their wealth. Immoral action, therefore, is conceptualized as decreasing another's wealth. Thus, if someone does you a favor, you are in her debt and seek to repay the favor. This is the basis of the metaphor of Moral Accounting, in which morality prescribes a balancing of the moral books. The deep analysis of morality has important implications for politics, as shown by Lakoff's analysis of liberal and conservative worldviews on morality and politics. This analysis is based on two opposing models of the family, the nurturant parent and the strict father families (Lakoff 1996). Under the metaphor of The Nation as a Family, these opposing family models are transformed into moral ((251)) and political worldviews that are fundamentally at odds. Such worldview metaphors tend to be so deeply pervasive that they organize other metaphors into moral and political conceptual systems. Metaphor Composition In More Than Cool Reason (1989), Lakoff and Turner ap-plied deep analysis to metaphors in complex poetic and literary texts. The analysis revealed an anatomy of imagination: new metaphorical ideas—that is, new ways of organizing and understanding experience—arise from the combination of simpler conceptual metaphors to form complex ones. Consequently, innovation and novelty are not miraculous; they do not come out of nowhere. They are built using the tools of everyday metaphorical thought, as well as other commonplace conceptual mechanisms. For example, Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 uses three metaphors for a lifetime: a day, a year, and a fire. Lakoff and Turner note that these are composite metaphors made up of the following more basic metaphors: Life Is Light and Death Is Darkness, Life Is Heat and Death Is Cold, and A Lifetime Is a Cycle of Waxing and Waning. Days, years, and fires all involve a waxing and waning cycle, with light and heat during waxing and darkness and cold during wan-ing. In addition, Lakoff and Turner found cases of composition involving both metaphor and metonymy. In the classic figure of the Grim Reaper, there is such a composition. The term \"reaper\" is based on the metaphor of People as Plants: just as a reaper cuts down wheat with a scythe before it has gone through its life cycle, so the Grim Reaper comes with his scythe indicating a premature death. The metaphor of Death as Departure is also part of the myth of the Grim Reaper. In the myth, the Reaper comes to the door and the deceased\ndeparts with him. The figure of the Reaper is also based on two conceptual ((252)) metonymies. The Reaper takes the form of a skeleton—the form of the body after it has decayed, a form which metonymically symbolizes death. The Reaper also wears a cowl, the clothing of monks who presided over funerals at the time the figure of the Reaper became popular. Further, in the myth the Reaper is in control, presiding over the departure of the deceased from this life. Thus, the myth of the Grim Reaper is the result of two metaphors and two metonymies having been put together with precision. Lakoff and Turner thus showed in detail how conceptual metaphors and metonymies can fit together to form complex and novel combinations. Metaphors for Metaphor Every scientific theory is constructed by scientists—human beings who necessarily use the tools of the human mind. One of those tools is conceptual metaphor. When the scientific subject matter is metaphor itself, it should be no sur-prise that such an enterprise has to make use of metaphor, as it is embodied in the mind, to construct a scientific un- derstanding of what metaphor is. Our first metaphor for conceptual metaphor came from mathematics. We first saw conceptual metaphors as map-pings in the mathematical sense, that is, as mappings across conceptual domains. This metaphor proved useful in several respects. It was precise. It specified exact, systematic correspondences. It allowed for the use of source domain inference patterns to reason about the target domain. Finally, it allowed for partial mappings. In short, it was a good first approximation. However, the Mathematical Mapping metaphor proved to be inadequate in an important respect. Mathematical mappings do not create target entities, while conceptual metaphors often do. For example, time doesn't necessarily have a use and isn't necessarily a resource. Many people in cultures around the world simply live their lives without ((253)) being concerned about whether they are using their time efficiently. However, other cultures conceptualize time metaphorically as though it were a limited resource. The Time Is Money metaphor imposes on the time domain various as- pects of resources. In doing so, it adds elements to the time domain, creating a new understanding of time.\nIn order to account for this creative aspect, it was necessary to find a more adequate metaphor for conceptual metaphor. We needed a way to think about metaphors so that they could not just be mappings but also could add elements to a domain. We accordingly adopted the Projection Metaphor, based on the image of an overhead projector. We saw a target domain as an initial slide on the projector and metaphorical projection as the process of laying another slide on top of the first one, adding the structure of the source to that of the target. This metaphor for metaphor al-lowed us to conceptualize the idea that metaphors add extra entities and relations to the target domain. The Projection metaphor also allowed us to account for another fact. Before this book, it had been discovered that images have a structure. For example, imagine someone walking into a room. The room is conceptualized as a con- tainer, and the walking as comprising a path of motion with r a beginning outside the room and an ending inside. Containers and Paths are image-schemas in the sense that they are primitives that structure rich images. We discovered that the image-schema structure of the source domain is used in reasoning about the target domain. Moreover, by looking at hundreds of cases, we found that image-schema structure and image-schematic inferences seemed to be \"preserved\" by metaphors. That is, source domain containers (e.g., physical traps) are mapped to containers (e.g., metaphorical traps), with interiors mapped to interiors and exteriors mapped to exteriors. When a conceptual metaphor applies to a Path schema, goals are mapped to goals, origins to origins, and so on. Under the Projection metaphor, this was an immediate consequence. ((254)) Unfortunately, the Projection metaphor introduced a major problem. According to the Projection metaphor, all of the source domain should be projected onto the target; however, some parts of the source domain are not mapped. In Theories Are Buildings, much is not mapped—the paint, the electrical wiring, and so on. According to the Conduit metaphor, I can give you an idea, but I still have it, which isn't true in the source domain of physical objects. If I give you a diamond, I no longer have it. In short, mappings tend to be partial, but the Projection metaphor doesn't allow this. Even worse, there is a systematicity about certain aspects of partial mappings. A source domain element is not mapped if it would produce an inference that would contradict the internal structure of the target. In that case, the mapping must be overridden. Thus, we needed to add to the Projection metaphor the ugly idea of target domain over-rides. The unfortunate principle behind this term is \"Don't map an element if it would give rise to a contradiction in the target domain.\" (Lakoff 1993) By 1997 the Projection metaphor was abandoned in fa-vor of a neural theory. That theory came out of the Neural Theory of Language project directed by Jerome Feldman and George Lakoff at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley. Primary Metaphor and the Neural Theory A major advance in metaphor theory came in 1997 with fundamental insights by Joseph Grady (1997), Christopher Johnson (1997), and Srinivas Narayanan (1997). We had found cases, like More Is Up, in which embodied experience in the world seemed to provide a grounding for metaphors. In More Is Up, for example, we regularly experience an increase in\nheight correlated with an increase in quantity, as when one pours more water into a glass. What had kept us from noticing bodily grounding in its full grandeur was our major concentration on complex meta- ((255)) phors of the sort discussed in this book. Grady showed that complex metaphors arise from primary metaphors that are directly grounded in the everyday experience that links our sensory-motor experience to the domain of our subjective judgments. For example, we have the primary conceptual metaphor Affection Is Warmth because our earliest experiences with affection correspond to the physical experience of the warmth of being held closely. Christopher Johnson has argued that children learn primary metaphors on the basis of the conflation of conceptual domains in everyday life. He studied how the Knowing Is Seeing metaphor develops, demonstrating that children first use \"see\" literally, that is, only about vision. Then there is a stage when seeing and knowing are conflated, when children say things like \"See Daddy come in\" or \"See what I spilled\"; seeing occurs together with knowing. Only later do clear metaphorical uses of \"see\" like \"See what I mean\" occur. These uses are about knowledge, not literal seeing. The results of Joseph Grady's and Christopher Johnson's research can be explained by the neural theory of metaphor developed by Srinivas Narayanan (1997). Using computa- tional techniques for neural modeling, Narayanan developed a theory in which conceptual metaphors are computed neurally via neural maps—neural circuitry linking the sensory- motor system with higher cortical areas. The terms map and mapping used here come from neuroscience. In the visual system of the brain, neurons project, that is, extend, from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V 1), with neurons that are adjacent or nearby in the retina projecting to neurons that are adjacent or nearby in V I . The neurons active in V1 are said to form a map in V 1 of the retinal image. The metaphor here is topographic, with the retina as territory and VI as the map. Similarly, the motor cortex is said to contain a map of the body. Neuronal clusters throughout the body \"project\" (that is, are connected) to neuronal clusters in the motor cortex, with neuronal clusters adjacent or nearby on the body pro- ((256)) jecting to neuronal clusters adjacent to or nearby the corresponding clusters in the motor cortex. Maps of such types are common in the brain. In the neural theory of metaphor, therefore, the terms map and projection take on a whole new meaning. The maps or mappings are physical links: neural circuitry link-ing neuronal clusters called nodes. The domains are highly structured neural ensembles in different regions of the brain. The neural maps are learned via neural recruitment, the long-term potentiation of neurons connected to the source and target neural ensembles that are coactive during John-son's period of conflation. (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chap-ter 4.) This neural learning mechanism produces a stable, conventional system of primary metaphors that tend to re-\nmain in place indefinitely within the conceptual system and are independent of language. For example, the metaphor Affection Is Warmth (as in, \"He's a warm person.\" or \"She's a block of ice.\") arises from the common experience of a child being held affectionately by a parent; here, affection occurs together with warmth. In Johnson's terms, they are conflated. There is neuronal activation occurring simultaneously in two separate parts of the brain: those devoted to emotions and those devoted to temperature. As the saying goes in neuroscience, \"Neurons that fire together wire together.\" Appropriate neural connections between the brain regions are recruited. These connections physically constitute the Affection Is Warmth metaphor. Metaphor is a neural phenomenon. What we have referred to as metaphorical mappings appear to be realized physically as neural maps. They constitute the neural mechanism that naturally, and inevitably, recruits sensory-motor inference for use in abstract thought. Primary metaphors arise spontaneously and automatically without our being aware of them. There are hundreds of such primary conceptual metaphors, most of them learned unconsciously and ((257)) automatically in childhood simply by functioning in the everyday world with a human body and brain. There are primary metaphors for time, causation, events, morality, emotions, and other domains that are central to human thought. Such metaphors also provide a superstructure for our systems of complex metaphorical thought and language. You don't have a choice as to whether to think metaphorically. Because metaphorical maps are part of our brains, we will think and speak metaphorically whether we want to or not. Since the mechanism of metaphor is largely unconscious, we will think and speak metaphorically, whether we know it or not. Further, since our brains are embodied, our metaphors will reflect our commonplace experiences in the world. Inevitably, many primary metaphors are universal because everybody has basically the same kinds of bodies and brains and lives in basically the same kinds of environments, so far as the features relevant to metaphor are concerned. The complex metaphors that are composed of primary metaphors and that make use of culturally based conceptual frames are another matter. Because they make use of cultural information, they may differ significantly from culture to culture. The Neural Basis of Metaphorical Thought When we imagine seeing a scene, our visual cortex is active. When we imagine moving our bodies, the pre-motor cortex and motor cortex are active. In short, some of the same parts of our brains are active in imagining as in perceiving and doing. We will use the term enactment for dynamic brain functions shared both during perceiving and acting and during imagining. An enactment, real or imagi- native, is dynamic, that is, it occurs in real time. Our sensory-motor concepts arise from our sensory-motor experiences\n(experiences moving in space, perceiving, ((258)) manipulating objects, and so on). Fixed concepts are neural information structures called neural parameterizations that can guide imaginative enactments when activated. Concep- tual metaphors, at the neural level, link source domain parameterizations to target domain parameterizations. By this means we can carry out metaphorical enactments—forms of imagination in which abstract reasoning is governed by sensory-motor enactments unfolding in real time and in real contexts. Multiple enactments are always being carried out by the brain, and single enactments can be guided by multiple parameterizations. Consequently, target domain enactments can be governed by multiple metaphors. This explains why there are complex metaphorical sentences like I've fallen in love, but we seem to be going in different directions. Here a number of metaphors structure the enactment: Lack of Control Is Down, as with \"fall\"; States Are Locations, as with \"in love\"; Changes Are Motions, as when falling in love is characterized as a change to a new state; and Love Is A Journey, as when lovers may be \"going in different directions.\" In such a specific target domain enactment, love can be understood in terms of a state (in love), in terms of issues of control (falling), and in terms of the compatibility of the life goals of the lovers (going in different directions). This is not at all like the old Projection Metaphor. Metaphorical inferences are typically carried out via source do-main enactments. The results of source domain inferences are carried over to the target domain via neural links. The learning of new metaphors therefore involves only the establishment of new neural connections and not the creation of copies of complex, inferential machinery. No overrides are necessary. The reason is this: Metaphors are learned when two experiences occur at once. If a metaphorical link would result in a contradiction in the target domain, it will not be learned. Neurally, contradictions are mutual inhibitions. Any would-be link that would lead to a contradiction ((259)) with the inherent structure of the target domain will be inhibited; thus it will never be learned. Locating the theory of metaphor within the Neural Theory of Language has a number of advantages: We gain an explanation via embodiment for how primary metaphors are learned: universal primary metaphors arise from universal primary experiences. We gain an explanation for why metaphorical thought exists and why it is normal and inescapable: the regular co-activation of two domains results in the recruitment of neural circuitry linking them.\n—No theory of overrides is needed. Metaphors fit naturally with the rest of the Neural Theory of Language. Neural enactment provides a mechanism for characterizing the dynamic use of metaphor in context and in discourse. —Since the Neural Theory of Language comes with explicit computational models, there is an explicit computational account of how metaphors operate dynamically. Metaphor and Dynamic Enactment We have been concerned with metaphorical inferences since we wrote Metaphors We Live By. However, an important distinction between two types of inference has only recently been pointed out. In Narayanan's model (1997), parameterization gives rise to what we will call structural inferences, which characterize static inferential structure. Enactment inferences arise, on the other hand, only in the unfolding of a dynamic process. An example of a structural inference in the domain of economics would be \"Increasing the money supply without increasing production tends to increase inflation.\" Such probabilistic inferences characterize the tendencies that structure a national economic system. Compare this with ((260)) the kind of inference mechanism used to understand the enactment of a physical action, such as \"John fell into a ditch and Harry pulled him out.\" Here the detailed inferences arise as a result of imagining what happened. John went out of control in falling; he may well have gotten hurt; he couldn't get out by himself; Harry grasped his arm (or other part of his body); Harry had strength or leverage that John did not; Harry exerted force, pulling hard and perhaps injuring himself to some extent; and John gradually came up out of the ditch as Harry pulled. In his modeling of economic discourse (1997), Narayanan took up sentences like, France .fell into a recession and Germany pulled it out. Here a number of conceptual metaphors and a metonymy are at work. Metaphors: Nations Are People; Economies Are Entities That Move Forward Over Time, up or down; A Recession Is A Hole; Economic Force Is The Use Of Money. Metonymy: A Nation Stands For Its Economy. For example, \"France\" stands for the French economy. Narayanan showed that the overall inferences derive from a combination of both types of inference, those being structural inferences about international economics (target do-main) and enacted inferences about falling and pulling (source domain). The enacted inferences are embodied; as such, they are carried out in the source domain. Their effects are mapped to the target domain and hence to the dis-course space of international economics. The source do-main (of falling and pulling) is enacted, and the inferences are mapped to the target domain of international economics. By that means, they influence the reasoning involved in the ongoing discourse about international economics—literal structural inferences and enacted metaphorical inferences mix with each other and with contextual information to give rise to new structure. That new structure does not follow from the source domain alone, the subject matter (target) domain alone, or context alone. Narayanan happened to discuss cases in which only the source domain\n((261)) used enacted inferences. There are other cases in which the target domain also has to be imaginatively enacted. These technical achievements have given us a neural theory of dynamic metaphor use in enacted discourse, one that has been computationally implemented in significant ways. Enactment and Blending The Neural Theory of Language project began in 1988 and continues today. Over roughly the same period, Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner (2002) have developed a theory of blended spaces that, though different in scope and intent, overlaps in important ways with certain aspects of the Neural Theory of Language. Blending theory takes for granted all of the static, long-term conceptual structure that is used in enactment. In other words, it assumes all the structure that we call parameter- izations, including metaphorical mappings from source to target domains, as well as image- schemas, force-dynamic schemas, frames, prototypes, metonymic mappings, and so on. Blending theory is centrally concerned with the use of all this general conceptual structure in particular examples. That is, it is concerned with conceptual integration: how conceptual structures are combined for use in particular cases, especially in imaginative cases. What is called blend-ing or conceptual integration in blending theory seems to correspond to binding in the neural theory. Blending theory makes use of Fauconnier's theory of Mental Spaces, relatively small mental models of particular situations that have been structured by the concepts in our conceptual systems. A blended space is a mental space that imaginatively combines elements of at least two other men-tal spaces that are structured by our ordinary long-term conceptual system. Here is a simple example of a blend that recently appeared on TV: a Jewish pizza. A Jewish cooking show fea- ((262)) tured Wolfgang Puck, the noted Austrian chef from LA, famous for his elegant pizzas and married to a Jewish woman. His Jewish pizza starts with a pizza dough baked with finely sliced red onions then topped with creme fraiche (an elegant French variant of sour cream), finely chopped shallots, lox, salmon caviar, and finely chopped dill. The pizza dough is the element taken from the conventional pizza, and the Jewish elements are the lox, creme\nfraiche (sour cream a la Wolfgang Puck), onion, and so on. As an object in the world, the Jewish pizza is just what it is: lox, dough, onions, a cultured cream, etc. But conceptually (and tastewise), it is a blend of elements from pizzas and elements from Jewish cooking. As the Jewish pizza has become a staple of Puck's repertoire, it has become a food concept of its own. Although for the most part it leaves in place the concept of pizza and the concept of Jewish cook-ing, it makes a slight extension of both concepts and thereby extends the idea of Jewish cooking and the idea of what a pizza is. According to Blending Theory, this would be a blend with two input .vpaces: a space structured by parts of the conceptual domain of ordinary pizza and a space structured by parts of the conceptual domain of Jewish cooking. The idea of Jewish pizza is a conceptual blend of the ideas in those input spaces. The space containing the idea of the Jewish pizza is the Mended space—a new conceptual product of an operation of blending elements. The Neural Theory of Language provides a neural under-pinning for the theory of conceptual blends. Blends are formed by both neural mappings and neural bindings. In a neural binding, two conceptual entities are seen as being the same entity. In the Jewish pizza, the pizza topping is the same entity as the lox with creme fraiche. The neural map-ping would link the pizza schema with the open-faced loxon-bagel schema. Such a neural structure, with both map-pings and bindings, forms a blend at the conceptual level. ((263)) Here we see what the two theories accomplish, one at the cognitive level and the other at the neural level. The Jewish pizza blend is obviously a literal blend, so literal that you can actually make one and eat it. Fauconnier and Turner (2002) have observed that there are also metaphoric blends, blends that arise when one input space is structured by the source domain of an existing conceptual metaphor in the conceptual system, and the other input space is structured by the target domain of that metaphor. Of course, there need not be a blended space whenever a conceptual metaphor is used. Take a sentence like \"Steel prices rose.\" This is an instance of More Is Up. When steel sellers are charging more for their steel, the situation is conceptualized and spoken of in terms of a spatial rise. But there need be no entity that is rising in space. However, blends are possible with this metaphor. Imagine a graph of changes in steel prices that is structured by the More Is Up metaphor—\"higher\" prices are literally higher on the graph—and by the Change is Motion and Fictive Motion metaphors, in which changes are movements and a line represents the path of a moving entity from left to right. In this graph, the line is tilted higher on the right side, indicating in the literal drawing that prices have become higher metaphorically. What makes this a blend is a binding (in Neural Theory of Language terms): an identification of prices charged with the heights of points on the line in the graph. Over more than a decade, Fauconnier and Turner have collected hundreds of examples of imaginative blends, including metaphorical blends, demonstrating beyond doubt that blends are a feature of our everyday mental life. Fauconnier and Turner have also looked at length at the properties of blends, discovering principles that make for good blends. In the Neural Theory of Language, the correspond-ing enterprise is to explain, in terms of neural computation, neural learning and neural optimization, why the particular\nu ((264)) properties and principles found by Fauconnier and Turner exist. The Neural Theory of Language and Blending Theory are very different enterprises, which happen to overlap in subject matter in certain cases. Blending theory focuses on conceptual integration at the level of spaces, the level of the formation of particular cases from preexisting conceptual structures. It also looks at the conventionalization of these blends, a process by which blends may become part of conceptual structure. The Neural Theory of Language also focuses on conceptual integration. In addition, it seeks a precise, overall computational neural account of language as a whole and of the ideas expressed by language. It is concerned both with formally characterizing parameterizations and with precisely building computational models of embodied enactments. The Neural Theory of Language also concentrates on mod-eling learning, both the learning of concepts and the learn-ing of language to express those concepts. So far as metaphor is concerned, the Neural Theory of Language at-tempts to explain on neural grounds why we have the primary metaphors we have. Some Corrections and Clarifications This book was our first attempt to spell out the nature of metaphorical thought and its relation to language. Inevitably, we made some mistakes. Here are some revisions: The division of metaphors into three types—orientational, ontological, and structural— was artificial. All metaphors are structural (in that they map structures to structures); all are ontological (in that they create target do-main entities); and many are orientational (in that they map orientational image-schemas). We did not yet see the profundity of primary metaphor, and, as a result, some of our analyses were incomplete. This was evident, for example, in our analysis of Argument ((265)) Is War. Many readers have correctly observed that most people learn about argument\nbefore they learn about war. The metaphor actually originates in childhood with the pri- mary metaphor Argument Is Struggle. All children struggle against the physical manipulations of their parents; and, as language is learned, the physical struggle comes to be accompanied by words. The conflation of physical struggle with associated words in the development of all children is the basis for the primary metaphor Argument Is Struggle. As we grow up, we learn about more extended and violent struggles like battles and wars, and the metaphor is ex-tended via that knowledge. The distinction between metaphor and metonymy is real but often confusing. Here is the basic distinction: In a metaphor; there are two domains: the target domain, which is constituted by the immediate subject matter, and the source domain, in which important metaphorical reasoning takes place and that provides the source concepts used in that reasoning. Metaphorical language has literal meaning in the source domain. In addition, a metaphoric mapping is multiple, that is, two or more elements are mapped to two or more other elements. Image-schema structure is preserved in the mapping—interiors of containers map to interiors, exteriors map to exteriors; sources of motion to sources, goals to goals, and so on. In a metonymy, there is only one domain: the immediate subject matter. There is only one mapping; typically the metonymic source maps to the metonymic target (the referent) so that one item in the domain can stand for the other. Although these are considerable differences, it is understandable why there is occasional confusion between metaphor and metonymy. First, in both cases there is a conceptual mapping which has a reflection in language: a linguistic expression with meaning A expressing meaning B. If you are mostly looking at the surface forms of the language, rather than at the conceptual systems and inferential structure, you may not be looking in the right place to no- ((266)) tice the difference. Second, there is neural coactivation in both metaphor and metonymy. In metaphor, there is coactivation of two domains; in metonymy there is coactivation of two frame elements. However, a single complex frame may be formed from simple frames coming from two different conceptual domains. For example, the Time-For-ATrip frame brings together the domains of Time and Space in a way that is not metaphorical. In this frame, there is a correlation between time and distance, with a mapping from times to distances that can be traveled in those times. Thus there can be a Time-For-Distance metonymy, as in: (Metonymy) San Francisco is a half hour from Berkeley. Here the time (a half hour) stands metonymically for the distance. Notice that the time is from the Time domain and the distance is from the Space domain. This is a mapping of an element from one domain to an element of another. It is a metonymy, not a metaphor, because the two domains are part of a single, literal frame and because there is a single mapping, not a multiple mapping. Compare this case with the spatial metaphor for time that arises from a correlation in experience between time and location, as in:\n(Metaphor) Chanukah is close to Christmas. In the metaphor, Time is the target domain and Space is the source domain. In the sentence given, the relationship between the times of the two holidays is given metaphorically in terms of space (close to). Here Time is the subject matter of the sentence and Space is not; it is only the conceptual source. In the metonymy case, the relationship between time and space (the time for the trip) is the subject matter of the sentence. The moral is this: When distinguishing metaphor and metonymy, one must not look only at the meanings of a single linguistic expression and whether there are two do- ((267)) mains involved. Instead, one must determine how the ex-pression is used. Do the two domains form a single, complex subject matter in use with a single mapping? If so, you have metonymy. Or, can the domains be separate in use, with a number of mappings and with one of the domains forming the subject matter (the target domain), while the other domain (the source) is the basis of significant inference and a number of linguistic expressions? If this is the case, then you have metaphor. Applications of Metaphor Theory In the twenty-five years since we first discovered conceptual metaphor, researchers in fields as diverse as literary theory, legal studies, linguistics, and the philosophy of science have made exciting applications of the theory. They have identified conceptual metaphors at the heart of poetry, law, politics, psychology, physics, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Their research reveals how metaphor structures how we think—and even what thoughts are permitted—in the following intellectual disciplines: Literary Analysis. In More Than Cool Reason (1989), Lakoff and Turner demonstrated that metaphors in poetry are, for the most part, extensions and special cases of sta-ble, conventional conceptual metaphors used in everyday thought and language. The metaphoric innovations of poets are shown thereby to consist not in the totally new creation of metaphoric thought but in the marshalling of already ex-isting forms of metaphoric thought to form new extensions and combinations of old metaphorical mappings. Lakoff and Turner also showed that conventional conceptual metaphor lies at the heart of proverbs; and, in Death Is the Mother of Beauty (1987), Turner showed how everyday conceptual metaphor can form the basis of alle-gory when applied to plot structure. In The Literary Mind ((268))\n(1996), Turner then demonstrated how metaphoric blends lie behind the construction of fables and of other common products of the literary imagination. The metaphorical basis of the moral dimension of literature becomes apparent from the discussion of metaphor and morality by Johnson in Moral Imagination (1993), by Lakoff in Moral Politics (1996), and by Lakoff and John-son in Philosophy in the Flesh (1999). Politics, Law, and Social Issues. The most important application of the theory of conceptual metaphor has been in the areas of law, politics, and social issues. Legal theorist Steven Winter has written extensively in law review articles and in a major book, A Clearing in the Forest (2001), about the central role of metaphor in legal reasoning. Legal metaphors abound, from the metaphor of the Corporation As Person (with First Amendment rights), to the metaphor of real property as bundles of rights, to the evolving metaphorical understanding of intellectual property. As Winter shows, it is common for the Supreme Court to use metaphors to extend legal categories developed in previous decisions. Metaphor is thus a powerful legal tool that has effects throughout our social lives. Lakoff's essay \"Metaphor and War,\" distributed to many millions over the Internet on the eve of the Gulf War, re-mains one of the most important analyses not only of the use of metaphor by the U.S. government to persuade the populace but also of the role of conceptual metaphors in planning foreign policy. It shows in detail how the metaphors used within the U.S. government to conceptualize the political and economic situation in Iraq systematically hid the most dreadful consequences of that war. The chap-ter on rationality in Lakoff and Johnson's Philosophy in the Flesh (1999) is a thorough analysis of the metaphorical structure of the rational actor model used widely in economics and politics and of what that model hides. Lakoff's Moral Politics (1996) analyzes the political ((269)) worldviews of conservatives and progressives in America. Lakoff asks why their respective views on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, taxation, social programs, the en- vironment, and art fit together into two opposing frame-works that are each sensible and coherent. The answer is that these views are held together by pervasive metaphors for morality that are in turn organized by opposing idealized models of the family. Conservative intellectuals have explicitly articulated the main outlines of the family-morality-politics connections, but, for the most part, progressives have not. The book provides progressives with a guide to understanding their own moral system. It shows how that system unites various kinds of progressives and what the overall moral basis is behind progressive as well as conservative politics. The analysis applies to every major social issue in America. Psychology. Metaphor analysis has proved important for both cognitive and clinical psychology. Cognitive psychol-ogy is dominated by the old idea that concepts are all literal and disembodied. The literature on metaphor theory pro-vides overwhelming evidence against that view and opens the possibility for a much more interesting cognitive psy-\nchology, which to some extent already exists (Gibbs 1994). For example, considerable research has been done on the metaphorical conceptualization of emotions (Lakoff 1987, Case Study 1; Kovecses 1990) as well as on metaphors for the self (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 13), mind, memory, and attention (Fernandez-Duque and Johnson 1999). The promise of metaphor theory for clinical psychology is enormous. We now know enough of our unconscious metaphor systems to reveal how they affect our lives as in- dividuals and what personal metaphors we have developed over our lifetimes to make sense of our lives. We also know what basic metaphors there are for marriage and love and how spouses may differ in their metaphors. Such differences can lead to enormous difficulties. Lakoff's Moral ((270)) Politics describes crucially important differences in family models and how these differences may affect later life (1996). Though skilled therapists may have well-developed intuitions in this area, metaphor theory provides a systematic guide to the cognitive and affective dimensions of our sense of self. (For a discussion of the application of metaphor theory to dreams, see Lakoff 1997). Mathematics. If any area has been taken to be literal, dis-embodied, and objective, it is mathematics. Yet Lakoff and Nunez have shown that mathematics too is metaphorical through and through (2000). Take the number line. Numbers don't have to be points on a line. It is a metaphor that Numbers Are Points on a Line, just as it is a metaphor that Numbers Are Sets, which is used in the set-theoretical foundations for mathematics developed in the late nineteenth century. Where Mathematics Comes From, by Lakoff and Nunez (2000), is a massive study of the metaphorical structure of mathematics, from arithmetic to set theory and logic, to forms of infinity, to classical advanced mathematics. Mathematics turns out not to be a disembodied, literal, objective feature of the universe but rather an embodied, largely metaphorical, stable intellectual edifice constructed by human beings with human brains living in our physical world. Cognitive Lingustics. Metaphor Theory is a central subdiscipline of the field of cognitive linguistics, which seeks to provide explanatory foundations for conceptual systems and language in the general study of the brain and the mind. As such, it draws on, and seeks to integrate, recent work in cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology to form a unified picture that can explain as many aspects of language as possible, from syntax to semantics to discourse. Other central developments in cognitive linguistics include: ((271)) 1.the semantics of closed-class elements such as spatial relations (Talmy 2000) 2.studies of category structure, including basic-level cate-\ngories, prototypes, and radial categories (Lakoff 1987) 3.mental spaces (Fauconnier 1985; Fauconnier and Sweetser 1996) 4.frame semantics (Fillmore 1982, 1985; Sweetser 1990) 5.blended spaces (Fauconnier and Turner 1998, 2002) 6.cognitive grammar (Langacker 1986, 1990, 1991) 7.cognitive construction grammar (Goldberg 1995; Lakoff 1987, Case Study 3). The Neural Theory of Language is being developed. It seeks to provide a unified theory of thought and language based on neural computation (Regier 1996; Narayanan 1997; Feldman and Lakoff, forthcoming). Philosophy. Metaphors We Live By began partly as an at- tempt to answer influential claims about metaphor made by two major contemporary American philosophers—Donald Davidson, who claimed that metaphors are meaningless, and John Searle, who claimed that there are semantic and pragmatic principles that allow one to assign literal meanings to metaphorical sentences. We realized that their arguments rested on common assumptions held both in analytic philosophy and throughout the Western tradition, namely, that concepts are all conscious, literal, and disembodied, that is, not crucially shaped by the body and brain. As we discuss in the final chapters of this book, the facts of conceptual metaphor theory are incompatible with many major assumptions of Western philosophy: it is just not true that all thought is conscious, literal, and disembodied. Over the two decades since we finished this book, we have struggled to figure out what philosophy would look like if we started with the empirical results from embodied cognitive science about the mind and language and reconstructed philosophy anew. The results of these labors are presented in ((272)) Philosophy in the Flesh (1999), which is a broad and deep rethinking of the nature of: \u0000truth and science; \u0000basic philosophical concepts such as time, events, causation, the mind, the self, morality, being and essence; \u0000the metaphorical structure that defines the fundamental forms of reason used by great philosophers from the Presocratics, Plato, and Aristotle, to Descartes and Kant, to con-temporary analytic philosophers such as Quine; \u0000the consequences for a new view of what a human being is, what religion and spiritual experience are, and what the job of philosophy itself is. Summary The theory of metaphor has come a long way from the humble beginnings presented in this slim volume. Yet, most of the key ideas in this book have been either sustained or developed further by\nrecent empirical research in cognitive linguistics and in cognitive science generally. These key ideas are the following: Metaphors are fundamentally conceptual in nature; metaphorical language is secondary. Conceptual metaphors are grounded in everyday experience. --Abstract thought is largely, though not entirely, metaphorical. Metaphorical thought is unavoidable, ubiquitous, and mostly unconscious. Abstract concepts have a literal core but are extended by metaphors, often by many mutually inconsistent metaphors. Abstract concepts are not complete without metaphors. For example, love is not love without metaphors of magic, at-traction, madness, union, nurturance, and so on. ((273)) —Our conceptual systems are not consistent overall, since the metaphors used to reason about concepts may be inconsistent. —We live our lives on the basis of inferences we derive via metaphor. The Present Situation In spite of the massive and growing evidence for them, our basic claims have nonetheless met resistance for an obvious reason: they are inconsistent with assumptions that many people in the academic world and elsewhere first learned and that shaped the research agendas they still pursue. Many mainstream philosophers, linguists, and psychologists either have vehemently denied these claims or have preferred to ignore them and to go about their ordinary business as if the claims were false. The reason is clear—our claims strike at the heart of centuries-old assumptions about the nature of meaning, thought, and language. If the new empirical results are taken seriously, then people throughout our culture have to rethink some of their most cherished beliefs about what science and philosophy are and reconsider their values from a new perspective. Above all, the key sticking point is the existence of conceptual metaphor. If conceptual metaphors are real, then all literalist and objectivist views of meaning and knowledge are false. We can no longer pretend to build an account of concepts and knowledge on objective, literal foundations. This constitutes a profound challenge to many of the traditional ways of thinking about what it means to be human, about how the mind works, and about our nature as social and cultural creatures. At the same time, what we have discovered is fundamentally at odds with certain key tenets of postmodernist thought, especially those that claim that meaning is un-grounded and simply an arbitrary cultural construction. ((274)) What has been discovered about primary metaphor, for ex-ample, simply does not bear this\nout. There appear to be both universal metaphors and cultural variation. For these reasons, this book remains just as controversial and radical today as when it first appeared. It calls into question business as usual and requires new collaborative cross-disciplinary methods of inquiry.
